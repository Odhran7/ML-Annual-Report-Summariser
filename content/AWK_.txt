 item 1 business 

the company 

with a history dating back to 1886 american water is the largest and most geographically diverse publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the united states as measured by both operating revenues and population served a holding company originally incorporated in delaware in 1936 the company employs approximately 6400 professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to over 14 million people in 24 states the company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services collectively presented as the “regulated businesses” the company also operates marketbased businesses that provide complementary services individually these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and are collectively presented as the “marketbased businesses” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses 

on december 9 2021 the “closing date” the company sold all of the equity interests of the hos subsidiaries see item 1—business—marketbased businesses—sale of homeowner services group below and note 6—acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

customers 

the company’s regulated businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base a customer is defined as a person business municipality or any other entity that purchases the company’s water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period one single customer may purchase the company’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses examples of these customers are homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities 

the vast majority of the company’s regulated water customers are metered which allows the company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage typically on a monthly basis the company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption these methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption 

residential customers make up a substantial portion of the company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates the company also serves i commercial customers such as food and beverage providers commercial property developers and proprietors and energy suppliers ii fire service customers where the company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities iii industrial customers such as largescale manufacturers mining and production operations iv public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools and universities and v other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers 

the following chart depicts the allocation of the company’s regulated businesses’ operating revenue of 3384 million by type including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer for the year ended december 31 2021 

a includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community water systems under bulk contracts 

b includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges fees and rents 

presented in the table below is the number of water and wastewater customers the company served by class as of december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 which represents approximately 14 million people served as of december 31 2021 



a includes public authorities and other utilities and community water and wastewater systems under bulk contracts bulk contracts which are accounted for as a single customer in the table above generally result in service to multiple customers 

customer growth in the company’s regulated businesses is primarily from i adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water andor wastewater utility systems ii population growth in its authorized service areas and iii sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems 

capital investment 

the company plans to invest between 28 billion and 32 billion over the next 10 years for capital improvements including acquisitions to its regulated businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities the company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 110year replacement cycle by 2026 which it anticipates will enable the company to replace nearly 2200 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2022 and 2026 in addition from 2022 to 2026 the company’s capital investment in treatment plants storage tanks and other key aboveground facilities is expected to increase further addressing infrastructure renewal resiliency water quality operational efficiency technology and innovation and emerging regulatory compliance needs additionally the company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets the benefit of investing in resiliency projects was seen firsthand in the aftermath of tropical depression ida when the company’s new jersey subsidiary reported that all its operating areas successfully withstood widespread flooding and drinking water quality was not impacted in any of its service areas specifically the new jersey subsidiary’s raritanmillstone water treatment plant which was fortified with a 37 million flood protection project in 2018 withstood a record flood and continued to provide potable water supply for approximately 1 million people in parts of seven counties in central new jersey 

regulation and rate making 

the operations of the company’s regulated businesses are generally subject to regulation by pucs in the states in which they operate with the primary responsibility of the pucs being the promotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs review and approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital operation and maintenance “om” expenses capital expenditures taxes affiliated transactions and relationships reorganizations mergers and acquisitions and dispositions along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives regulatory policies vary from state to state and can change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the puc the timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions the company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag” which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and the recognition in rates of that change 

the company’s regulated businesses support regulatory practices at the pucs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices 



the company pursues enhancements to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments and to continue to provide safe clean reliable and affordable services to its customers the ability to seek regulatory treatment using the regulatory practices described above does not guarantee that the pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these regulatory practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes it is also the company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply and enhance certain mechanisms where they already exist 

acquisitions and strategic growth 

the us water and wastewater industries include investorowned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions according to the us environmental protection agency “epa” as of 2017 approximately 84 of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98 of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned the epa also estimates as of 2017 that there are approximately 50000 community water systems and approximately 15000 community wastewater systems in the united states with approximately 80 of the community water systems serving a population of 3000 or less 

a fundamental aspect of the company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of water andor wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the company operates its regulated businesses see item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information the proximity of acquisition opportunities to the company’s regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using the company’s existing management although the company typically retains the majority if not all of the employees of the acquired systems and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs the company’s current customer mix of 93 water and 7 wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation allowing the company to add wastewater customers where it already serves water customers the company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and if appropriate pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the company does not currently operate its regulated businesses before entering new regulated markets the company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to its customers as well as a line of sight to grow the company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market 

increasingly stringent environmental health and safety and water quality and water accountability regulations the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements among others that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets 

sale of new york american water company inc 

on january 1 2022 the company completed the sale of its new york subsidiary to liberty utilities eastern water holdings corp “liberty” an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of algonquin power  utilities corp under the terms of the stock purchase agreement dated november 20 2019 as amended by and among the company the company’s new york subsidiary and liberty the “stock purchase agreement” liberty purchased from the company all of the capital stock of the company’s new york subsidiary for a purchase price of 608 million in cash the sale was approved by the new york state department of public service on december 16 2021 the company’s regulated new york operations had approximately 127000 customers in the state of new york see note 6—acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

industry legislation 

on november 15 2021 the infrastructure investment and jobs act the “iija” was signed into law and provides for up to 55 billion to aid in improving the country’s ailing water infrastructure including 234 billion for drinking water and wastewater 15 billion for lead service line replacement through the drinking water state revolving fund and 10 billion for the treatment of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances “pfas” and other contaminants of emerging concern the bill also includes a lowincome assistance program which provides eligible lowincome customers who receive their water from public and private entities to be eligible to participate in the program the company is awaiting further guidance on the distribution of these funds 

in december 2020 congress passed and the president signed into law a 900 billion covid19 relief and 14 trillion us government appropriations package for 2021 which included 638 million for a lowincome water assistance program and 28 billion for capitalization grants under the clean water and drinking water state revolving funds 

in 2017 new jersey enacted the water quality accountability act the “wqaa” which sets operational standards for all water utilities in new jersey including municipal and investorowned utilities with more than 500 service connections this law imposes requirements in areas such as asset management water quality reporting remediation of notices of violation and hydrant and valve maintenance the wqaa requires the most senior water manager or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems to certify that the system meets the requirements under the wqaa enhanced wqaa legislation includes additional enforcement requirements for disclosure of results requires the sale of systems for prolonged violations and imposes new cyber security requirements and asset management plans the new amendments which provide for both civil and criminal penalties for falsification of documents were signed by the governor with an effective date of november 8 2021 

in 2018 indiana passed a law to set minimum operational expectations for all water and wastewater utilities in the state including municipal and investorowned utilities the law requires water and wastewater utilities to conduct rate analyses develop capital asset management plans and conduct cybersecurity and water loss audits it also requires water and wastewater utilities to participate in regional discussions and planning to assess opportunities for the more efficient use of water and wastewater utility assets and infrastructure water and wastewater utilities that fail to comply with the requirements of the law may be ineligible for grants and loans from the state revolving fund under the law all new municipal and investorowned utilities are required to be regulated by the indiana utility regulatory commission for ten years from inception of operations 

in 2020 missouri enacted the water safety and security act which requires small and mediumsized water providers to create cybersecurity valve inspection and hydrant inspection programs upon request by the missouri department of natural resources the water providers must certify compliance with all regulations regarding water quality sampling testing and reporting hydrant and valve testing and reporting and cybersecurity plans and procedures 

the company’s regulated subsidiaries in california illinois indiana iowa kentucky maryland missouri new jersey pennsylvania tennessee virginia and west virginia have access to utility valuation legislation and regulation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems the company supports full optionality for municipalities including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through thirdparty fair market valuations of purchased property fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation which allows the company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assets that is reflective of the assets’ fair market value while providing the company with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets subject to puc approval in 2021 the tennessee public utilities commission implemented acquisition valuation rules that create a mechanism to value water and wastewater assets based upon replacement cost new less depreciation 

consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a state as a result consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state overall the company believes that consolidated tariffs bring costeffective highquality services to a larger number of customers eleven of the company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing including california illinois indiana iowa kentucky maryland missouri new jersey pennsylvania virginia and west virginia 

competition 

the company’s regulated businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because i the company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises charters certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations collectively “cpcns” issued by state pucs or other authorities and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry however the company’s regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions when pursuing acquisitions the company’s largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served include essential utilities inc suez north america american states water company and california water service group from time to time the company also faces competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as algonquin power and utilities corp eversource energy and corix 

condemnation and eminent domain 

all or portions of the regulated businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods i eminent domain also known as condemnation ii the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original cpcn was granted and iii the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its cpcn the acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular cpcn 

as such the regulated businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business for example a citizens group in monterey california successfully added “measure j” to the november 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the monterey peninsula water management district the “mpwmd” should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of the monterey water service system assets the “monterey system assets” of the company’s california subsidiary and if feasible to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote this service territory represents approximately 40000 customers in november 2018 measure j was certified to have passed in august 2019 the mpwmd’s general manager issued a report that recommends that the mpwmd board 1 develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition 2 examine the feasibility of acquiring the monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the mpwmd becomes the owner of a larger system 3 evaluate whether the acquisition of the monterey system assets by the mpwmd is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of “feasible” as provided in measure j 4 ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition and 5 develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a resolution of necessity 

in november 2019 the mpwmd issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report finding in part that 1 an estimate of the monterey system assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately 513 million 2 the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills and 3 the acquisition of the monterey system assets by the mpwmd would be economically feasible on june 12 2020 the mpwmd issued a draft environmental impact report for the potential acquisition of the monterey system assets and a related district boundary adjustment that would be required if the mpwmd were to acquire and operate certain of the monterey system assets located outside the mpwmd’s boundaries on september 15 2020 the mpwmd gave notice of its intention to appraise the monterey system assets and related property interests on september 29 2020 the company’s california subsidiary declined to make the monterey system assets and related property interests available for inspection or to comply with any of the other requests contained in the mpwmd’s notice on october 7 2020 the mpwmd issued a final environmental impact report “feir” and on november 4 2020 the mpwmd certified the feir which purports to analyze the environmental impacts of the mpwmd’s project to 1 acquire the monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain if necessary and 2 expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system on november 25 2020 the company’s california subsidiary filed a petition challenging this certification in court a hearing on the matter was held on august 30 2021 and on november 19 2021 the court denied the petition see item 3—legal proceedings—challenge of certification—proposed monterey system final environmental impact report 

on february 26 2021 the mpwmd filed an application with the local agency formation commission of monterey county “lafco” seeking approval to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 58 parcels of land into the mpwmd’s boundaries on june 28 2021 lafco’s commissioners voted to require a thirdparty independent financial study as to the feasibility of an acquisition by the mpwmd of the monterey system assets on december 6 2021 lafco’s commissioners denied the mpwmd’s application to become a retail water provider determining that the mpwmd does not have the authority to proceed with a condemnation of the monterey system assets on january 5 2022 lafco’s commissioners confirmed the denial on january 31 2022 the mpwmd filed an application for reconsideration of lafco’s confirmation of denial a hearing on the application has been set for february 28 2022 

also five municipalities in the chicago illinois area approximately 30300 customers in total formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against the company in january 2013 seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities before filing its eminent domain lawsuit the water agency made an offer of 38 million for the pipeline the parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports a valuation trial was originally scheduled for october 2021 but has been continued to june 2022 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which the regulated businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently in california lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property in some cases the puc has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed also the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance 

water supply and wastewater services 

the company’s regulated businesses generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to its customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater typically the company does not own the water which is held in public trust and is allocated to the company through contracts permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multistate agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law the company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from groundwater sources such as wells and aquifers and water purchased from thirdparty water suppliers the level of water treatment the company applies varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only 

presented in the chart below are the company’s sources of water supply as of december 31 2021 

presented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the company’s top five states for the year ended december 31 2021 



the company’s ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water the company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of the company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes it might encounter in any particular service territory for example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas the company serves may experience wetter than average weather 

the company evaluates quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity to provide water service to its customers water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that the company has adequate water supply it uses longterm planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations the company reviews current climate science and global models related to temperature precipitation and sea level rise on an ongoing basis where actionable forecasts are available the company will use this information in its comprehensive planning studies and asset management plans these studies and plans which are used by the company to develop its asset management and system reliability strategies assess the climate risk and resiliency of the company’s water and wastewater systems over short medium and longterm time horizons and include evaluations of the availability of water supplies and system capacity against a number of different factors projections and estimates 

in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources the company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development in california where the state has been experiencing a multiyear drought the company utilizes multiple water supply options including numerous ground water wells in multiple aquifers as well as various longterm purchase water agreements with regional water suppliers to optimize supplies while assuring resiliency during dry years an example of the company’s use of longterm planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” in california the water supply project includes the construction of a desalination plant to be owned by the company’s california subsidiary and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant in addition the water supply project also includes the california subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” between monterey one water formerly known as the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the mpwmd the water supply project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of the california subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under orders of the california state water resources control board the “swrcb” for more information see item 3—legal proceedings—alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions and note 17—commitments and contingencies—contingencies—alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

seasonality 

customer demand for the company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use as such the company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year weather that is hotter andor drier than average generally increases operating revenues whereas weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues two of the company’s jurisdictions california and illinois have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the company to collect state pucauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period thereby lessening the impact of weather variability see regulated businesses—regulation and rate making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms 

marketbased businesses 

the company’s marketbased businesses provide water and wastewater services to the us government on military installations as well as municipalities and utility customers and previously provided home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers through its former hos business which was sold on december 9 2021 these businesses are not subject to regulation by state pucs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment operating revenues for the company’s marketbased businesses were 563 million for 2021 540 million for 2020 and 539 million for 2019 accounting for 14 14 and 15 respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods 

msg enters into longterm contracts with the us government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations msg is the company’s remaining primary marketbased business 

the company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its contract services group “csg” 

military services group 

msg operates on 17 military installations under 50year contracts with the us government as part of its utilities privatization program the scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and in certain instances systems expansion the replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to msg is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract traditionally both of these programs are funded from the contract fee at times new assets are required to support the installation’s mission and the construction of these assets is funded by the us government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract the capital for these assets historically has not been funded through the company’s debt or equity issuances rather the company has used limited working capital for shortterm needs under these contracts in april 2018 the us army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing contracts but the us army’s implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing however recent us army and navy utilities privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five or tenyear period after project completion three of msg’s current contracts require such capital project financing which the company is currently addressing through internal sources of liquidity 

the contract price for six of msg’s contracts with the us government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions the remaining 11 contracts with the us government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism called “economic price adjustment” all 17 contracts could be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the msg subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts msg would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs msg’s backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the us government is approximately 62 billion with an average remaining contract term of 41 years 

sale of homeowner services group 

the company has provided various warranty protection programs and other home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers through its hos operations on the closing date the company sold all of the equity interests in its hos subsidiaries to an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of funds advised by apax partners llp a global private equity advisory firm the “buyer” for total consideration of approximately 1275 billion see item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 6—acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

competition 

msg faces competition from a number of service providers including american states water company suez north america and veolia environnement sa 

environmental health and safety water quality and other regulation 

the company’s water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both its regulated businesses and marketbased businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water the company delivers to its customers and the manner in which it collects treats discharges recycles and disposes of wastewater in the united states these regulations are developed under federal legislation including the safe drinking water act the reduction of lead in drinking water act and the clean water act and under a variety of applicable state laws environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard for example while the epa has issued a nonenforceable health advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds perfluorooctanoic acid or pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid or pfos the new jersey department of environmental protection was the first state agency to establish a standard for perfluorononanoic acid or pfna in 2018 and has since established maximum containment levels for pfoa and pfos with implementation occurring in january 2021 the company is also subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the company delivers 

the company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices focused on compliance with environmental laws and regulations and the effective use of natural resources recognizing that drinking water standards have generally over time increased in number and become increasingly more stringent as newer or stricter standards are introduced the company’s capital and operating costs needed to comply with them will likely increase the company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental health and safety and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues the company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately 850 million over the next five years including 180 million in 2022 for environmental control facilities which the company defines for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land the company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations 

the company’s operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example the company’s water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements the company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its offsite disposal of wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” authorizes the epa and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under cercla or comparable state laws although the company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs to the company the company’s facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the us occupational safety and health act and inspections thereunder 

safe drinking water act 

the safe drinking water act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manufactured chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements to date the epa has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water quality indicators for drinking water and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years 

to help formulate the basis for future regulations the epa has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule the “monitoring rule” the company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the monitoring rule in previous rounds which occurs every five years including the fourth round that concluded at the end of 2020 there are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which lack a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor costeffective treatment options the process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex but the company actively participates with the epa and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge see research and development—contaminants of emerging concern for additional information 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial contaminants the epa has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants andor the byproducts of their use in the disinfection process examples of these rules are the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule the “longterm 2 rule” the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule the ground water rule which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources and the revised total coliform rule which implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects the company is within the epa’s time frame for compliance with all of these standards which includes sample collection data analysis and in some instances engineering planning and implementation of treatment enhancements recent monitoring as required by the longterm 2 rule has indicated that up to 30 of the company’s surface water systems have recently completed or need to implement additional disinfection protection mechanisms against cryptosporidium in many cases this will involve installing ultraviolet light disinfection systems and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades an estimated 100 million to 150 million of investment will still be required to upgrade the remaining facilities for cryptosporidium disinfection further the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds the company does not anticipate that any such regulations if enacted will require implementation in 2022 

the company conducted over 10 million water quality and turbidity tests in 2021 at its laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water the company participates in the partnership for safe water the epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 67 of the company’s surface water treatment plants receiving the epa program’s prestigious “director” award which recognizes utilities that i have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report ii created an action plan for continuous improvement and iii produced highquality drinking water the company accounts for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 66 of the company’s surface water treatment plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award 62 plants have received the “tenyear phase iii” award 57 plants have received the “fifteenyear phase iii” award and 39 plants have received the “twentyyear phase iii” award these awards recognize plants that have met the director award status for five 10 15 and 20 years respectively further nine of the company’s surface water plants have received the “presidents” award which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards and have maintained this status for at least five years 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements the company expects current cost requirements under the safe drinking water act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result the company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

lead and copper rule and reduction of lead in drinking water act 

in 1991 the epa published the lead and copper rule “lcr” to control lead and copper in drinking water and since that time has issued minor revisions in 2000 2004 and 2007 enhancing monitoring reporting and public education requirements in 2011 congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings for fixtures solder and flux while these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water legacy lead plumbing materials primarily in building plumbing still remain in many communities the failure of certain water systems in the united states to comply with the requirements of the lcr has received recent media attention and scrutiny and in certain cases has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects the company has started to replace lead service lines “lsls” in accordance with current scientific guidance also the company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements the epa finalized revisions to the lcr the “revised lcr” on january 15 2021 that are designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water the company is executing an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements which were originally mandated by january 2024 but have been delayed until at least late 2024 pending epa additional review capital expenditures and operating costs associated with the revised lcr will be determined once the epa completes its additional review but as previously noted costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates 

the company currently estimates that less than 5 of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the company or customer portion of the service line the company is replacing lsls as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects the company’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known lsls in most of its service areas by the end of 2030 at an estimated cost ranging from 600 million to 12 billion the company believes this will be attainable for most of its service areas where public policy is supportive of this goal the iija was signed into law in november 2021 and provides for up to 15 billion for lead service line replacement through drinking water state revolving funds the company is awaiting further guidance on eligibility the application process and the distribution of these funds with regard to future acquisitions the company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set lsl removal goals appropriate for those systems the prioritization of lsl removal is dependent on several factors including the company’s planned water main and service line renewal projects adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities lcr compliance monitoring results and cooperation with its customers with respect to replacing the customerowned portion of the lsl as necessary in certain cases these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement because replacing the external lsl in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the us national drinking water advisory council the lead service line replacement collaborative and the american water works association the company’s preferred approach is to replace the entire external lsl if lead is found on either the company or customer portion of the service line full lsl replacement is also consistent with the revised lcr the lead service line replacement collaborative is a diverse group of public health water utility environmental labor consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of lsls through collaborative efforts at the local level

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k the following material factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business operations 

our regulated businesses are subject to extensive regulation by state pucs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our regulated businesses also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for an inability to meet these regulatory requirements 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state pucs this regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us with the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to 

• cover our expenses including purchased water and costs of chemicals fuel and other commodities used in our operations 

• enable us to recover our investment and 

• provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment 

approval by the pucs is also required in connection with other aspects of our regulated businesses which are required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the pucs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions dispositions debt andor equity financing and in certain cases affiliated transactions some state pucs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business 

pucs and other governmental authorities have taken and may continue to take emergency or other actions in light of the ongoing covid19 pandemic that may impact us including prohibiting the termination of service for nonpayment and extending or delaying procedural schedules in our regulatory proceedings we are unable to predict the range of impacts that the ongoing covid19 pandemic and other related events may have on our ability to obtain these approvals as needed or requested by our regulated businesses in the ordinary course or at all or the nature or impacts of any further emergency or other action that may be taken by the pucs or other governmental authorities 

in any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if the rates approved are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates customers increase their conservation efforts or we experience unanticipated impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the levels estimated in establishing rates 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations including with respect to contaminants of emerging concern compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs as well as damage to our reputation 

our regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our marketbased businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations these requirements include among others cercla the clean water act the safe drinking water act the lcr and other federal and state requirements for example state pucs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our 

operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves providing water service for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

in addition cercla authorizes the epa to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our regulated businesses through customer rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination including potential releases of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of residual waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

attention is being given to contaminants of emerging concern including without limitation chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances examples of sources of contaminants include but are not limited to newly created chemical compounds including for example manufactured nanomaterials human and veterinary products perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds bacteria microbes viruses including the coronavirus amoebae and other pathogens and residual byproducts of disinfection we rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants and our role is to provide service that meets these standards if any in some of our states pucs may disapprove of cost recovery in whole or in part for implementation of treatment infrastructure for a contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard furthermore given the rapid pace at which these contaminants are being created andor discovered we may not be able to detect andor mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation in addition we believe these contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future which could significantly increase the cost of our operations 

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams groundwater aquifers and recycled water sources are held in the public trust and are not generally owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the source water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities or by entering into water purchase agreements these requirements which can change from time to time and vary by state or region may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water if we are unable to secure available or alternative sources of water our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 2009 cease and desist order the “2009 order” as amended by a july 2016 order the “2016 order” of the swrcb that requires our california subsidiary to significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminated on december 31 2021 the “2021 deadline” see item 3—legal proceedings—alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions which includes additional information regarding this matter we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act beginning in january 2022  cal am currently expects that it will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirement schedule contained in the 2016 order but continued compliance with the diversion reduction requirements for 2023 and future years 

will depend on successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand the 2009 order and the 2016 order remain in effect until cal am certifies to the swrcb and the swrcb concurs that cal am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized carmel river diversions while the company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters further attempts to comply with the 2009 order and the 2016 order may result in material additional costs or obligations including fines and penalties against our california subsidiary in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 order and the 2016 order which could have a material adverse effect upon us and our business results of operations and cash flows 

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions climate variability patterns or natural or other disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service interruptions due to severe weather climate variability patterns and natural or other events are possible across all our businesses these include among other things storms freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes landslides drought wildfires coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains pandemics including the covid19 pandemic and epidemics severe electrical storms sinkholes and solar flares weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our regulated businesses may not provide reimbursement to us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions rationing restrictions water conservation regulations and requirements to minimize water system leaks while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant puc determines they were reasonable and prudent we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will in fact be fully recovered moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise 

the issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide there is consensus among climate scientists that there will be worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability many climate variability predictions present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities including us such as 

• increased frequency and duration of droughts 

• increased precipitation and flooding 

• increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events 

• challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels 

• potential degradation of water quality 

• decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns 

• increases in disruptions in service 

• increased costs to repair damaged facilities or 

• increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency and severity of natural events including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water and wastewater treatment and conveyance facilities and systems 

because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity furthermore laws and regulations have been enacted that seek to reduce or limit ghg emissions and require additional reporting and monitoring and these regulations may become more pervasive or stringent in light of changing governmental agendas and priorities although the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain although some or all potential expenditures and costs associated with the impact of climate variability and related laws and regulations on our regulated businesses could be recovered through rates infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms there can be no assurance that state pucs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such 

expenditures and costs in whole or in part 

the current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay also known as “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses as a result of inflation or other factors incur increased cost of capital including as a result of increasing short and longterm rates or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications our inability to mitigate or minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business 

there is typically a delay known as “regulatory lag” between the time our regulated businesses make a capital investment or incur an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices for example two of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently in addition 10 of our state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates furthermore in setting rates nine of our state pucs allow us to use future test years which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis other examples of such regulatory practices include expense mechanisms that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case application process without the mechanisms 

while these mechanisms have mitigated or reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states we continue to seek approval of regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved them furthermore pucs may fail to adopt new surcharges and existing mechanisms may not continue in their current form or at all or we may be unable or become ineligible to continue to utilize certain of these mechanisms in the future although we intend to continue our efforts to seek state puc approval of constructive regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if partially successful our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected 

changes in laws and regulations can significantly and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

the impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to our regulated businesses is uncertain changes in laws or regulations the imposition of additional laws and regulations changes in enforcement practices of regulators government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations results of operations and cash flows certain of the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes of the individuals who serve as regulators and changes in the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others 

• making it more difficult for us to increase our rates and as a consequence to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return 

• changing the determination of the costs or the amount of costs that would be considered recoverable in rate cases and other regulatory proceedings 

• restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection efforts 

• requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers 

• limiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems purchase or dispose of assets or issue longterm debt or equity or making it less costeffective for us to do so 

• negatively impacting among other things i tax rates or positions or the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws ii the availability or amount of or our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of tax credits or tax abatement benefit iii the amount of taxes owed iv the timing of tax effects on rates or v the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 

• changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area 

• increasing the associated costs of or difficulty complying with environmental health safety consumer privacy water quality and water quality accountability laws and regulations to which our operations are subject 

• changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock 

• making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes 

• placing limitations prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates including service company and any of our other subsidiaries 

• restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers streams reservoirs or aquifers and 

• revoking or altering the terms of a cpcn issued to us by a state puc or other governmental authority 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs and liabilities 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks if collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated or inadequately treated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows certain of our wastewater systems have commercial and industrial customers that are subject to specific limitations on the type character and strength of the wastewater they are permitted to discharge into our systems the failure by these commercial and industrial customers to comply with their respective discharge requirements could in turn negatively impact our operations damage our facilities or cause us to exceed applicable discharge limitations and requirements liabilities resulting from such exceedance events could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a loss of one or more large industrial or commercial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our regulated businesses 

adverse economic conditions including the covid19 pandemic or other factors may cause our customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by such a customer typically results in reduced water usage by that customer in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations tariffs in place with respect to our regulated businesses may not reimburse us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments experience increases in short and longterm interest rates or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment and to improve aging infrastructure in 2021 we invested 18 billion in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and we believe will increase we expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations including among other things a portion of the net proceeds from the sales of hos and our new york subsidiary borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt and equity we may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper longterm debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all if we are not able to obtain sufficient financing we may be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of supply chain interruptions construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions legal and 

regulatory challenges or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions property damage and increased capital expenditures and om costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have risks associated with aging infrastructure including water and sewer mains pumping stations and water and wastewater treatment facilities additionally we may have limited information regarding buried and newly acquired assets which could challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset management and maintenance practices assets that have aged beyond their expected useful lives may experience a higher rate of failure failure of aging infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and om costs and negatively impact our future om efficiency ratio in addition failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage and in safety environmental and public health impacts to the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not fully recovered in rates our results of operations liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues 

the volume of water we sell during the warmer months typically in the summer is generally greater than during other months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

two of our jurisdictions california and illinois have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to recover the revenues authorized in a general rate case regardless of sales volume revenue stability mechanisms are designed to recognize declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently in those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism our operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality 

contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions damage to our reputation and private litigation 

the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system or the water service that is provided to our customers may be subject to contamination including among other items contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manufactured sources such as perchlorate perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds methyl tertiary butyl ether 14dioxane lead and other materials or chemical spills or other incidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks or other similar incidents in addition new categories of contaminants continue to emerge in the water industry if one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 limiting use of the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply in whole or in part potentially impacting basic sanitation and fire protection needs if service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods we may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance customer rates tariffs or contract terms and any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies see item 3—legal proceedings for information on certain pending lawsuits related to interruptions of water service 

since we are engaged in the business of providing water service to our customers contamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts of these claims in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances within the water supply or distributed finished drinking water in addition insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses and are subject to deductibles and other limitations pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions 

our business and operations have a large direct and indirect customer base and as a result we are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of water service wastewater and related or ancillary services the quality of water provided and the amount timeliness accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment arising out of these and other incidents may render legislatures and other governing bodies state pucs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative regulatory and economic outcomes as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our military services group a s well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

the properties of our regulated businesses segment include 76 dams the majority of which are earthen dams the failure of any of these dams could result in personal injury and property damage including without limitation downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs although in most cases the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future the inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes water mains and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes water mains and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes mains or reservoirs could result in injuries property and other damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes mains and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments 

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems which involves risks including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers which may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business 

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 

the negotiation and execution of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in among other things 

• incurrence or assumption of debt contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities and obligations including liabilities that were unknown or undisclosed at the time of acquisition 

• failure to recover acquisition premiums 

• unanticipated capital expenditures 

• failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 

• the need to successfully integrate the acquired systems’ operations and water quality cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures 

• recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges 

• fluctuations in quarterly results 

• unanticipated acquisitionrelated expenses 

• failure to realize anticipated benefits and synergies such as cost savings and revenue enhancements and 

• difficulties in integrating or assimilating personnel benefits services and systems 

some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business the systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated revenue return on equity or profitability or other perceived synergies and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our net income and profitability or adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities as consolidation activity increases in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions continues to increase the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions 

our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process a municipality other government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition 

for example in november 2018 monterey california ballot measure j which was added by a citizens group was certified as having been approved by a public vote requiring the mpwmd to conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the monterey system assets without an additional public vote the public vote led to the issuance by the mpwmd in november 2019 of a preliminary report finding among other things that the acquisition of the monterey system assets by the mpwmd would be economically feasible also five municipalities in the chicago illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our illinois subsidiary in january 2013 seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities this lawsuit remains pending and a valuation trial is scheduled for the second quarter of 2022 see item 1—business—regulated businesses—condemnation and eminent domain which includes additional information regarding these matters 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our regulated businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently in california lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property in some cases the puc has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits 

contesting an exercise of condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation eminent domain or other process may not be successful which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity 

we may be subject to physical and cyber attacks 

as operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical and cyber attacks from internal or external sources our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes our operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties further third parties including vendors suppliers and contractors who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access while we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational and technology systems those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities we cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack 

if despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred our operations could be disrupted property damaged and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen we could experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss we could suffer a loss of management time attention and resources from our regular business operations and we may be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties these types of events either impacting our facilities or the industry in general could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs 

in addition in the ordinary course of business we collect and retain sensitive information including personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in many cases we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks any theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation liability and costs as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators among others 

we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates 

our business is subject to complex and evolving federal state and local laws and regulations regarding consumer privacy and the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals which could result in among other things private or governmental claims or litigation against us changes to our business practices monetary penalties reputational harm and increased cost of operations 

laws and regulations are changing and increasing rapidly with respect to data and consumer privacy security and protection we are becoming subject to an increasing number of complex and continually evolving data and consumer privacy security and protection laws and regulations administered by various federal state and local governments including for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 federal and state governments have also adopted or are proposing other limitations on or requirements regarding the collection distribution use security and storage of personally identifiable information in addition the federal trade commission and state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the collection use and dissemination of data moreover we expect that current laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the united states will continue to evolve and increase and we cannot determine the impact that compliance with such future laws regulations or standards will have on us or on our business any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with current or future federal state or local data or consumer privacy or security laws regulations policies guidance industry standards or legal obligations or any incident resulting in unauthorized access to or acquisition release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers employees and others may result in private or governmental enforcement actions litigation or other claims against us fines and penalties or adverse perception or publicity about us and our businesses which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and could result in us incurring substantial costs these events could also require us to change our business practices and the events or such changes may result in significant diversions of resources distract management and divert the focus and attention of our security and technical personnel from other critical activities any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our regulated businesses as well as the operations of our marketbased businesses our insurance programs have 

varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make generally our insurance policies cover property damage worker’s compensation employer’s liability general liability cybersecurity terrorism risks and automobile liability each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims as a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles 

we rely on technology to facilitate the management of our business as well as our customer and supplier relationships and a failure or disruption of implemented technology could materially and adversely affect our business 

technology is an integral part of our business and operations and any failure or disruption of the technology or related systems we implement could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business effectively and efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations we use technology systems to among other things bill customers process orders provide customer service manage certain plant operations and construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor our plants and facilities and manage human resources supply chain inventory and accounts receivable collections as a specific example we depend on water meters to record and communicate the amount of water our customers use and in recent years we have experienced greater than expected performance failures with certain water meters used in the regulated businesses when these occur we work with meter manufacturers to determine and address the cause of such failures while these and other failures that we have experienced have not to date had a material adverse effect on our operations there can be no assurance that efforts to address performance failures or other issues we may experience with water meters will be successful and that these or future failures of water meters or other issues will not have a material adverse effect on us 

although we do not believe that the technology we have implemented or may in the future implement is at a materially greater risk of failure than that used by other similar organizations our technology and operations that use or rely on technology remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from among other things failure or interruption of the technology or its related systems loss or failure of power internet telecommunications or data network systems and operator error or improper operation by the negligent or improper supervision of or the intentional acts of employees contractors and other third parties any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

an inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a significant part of our longterm strategic focus on safety operational excellence om expense efficiency water quality asset and capital management and the customer experience includes implementing new technologies for among other things customer service and support environmental compliance water metering water quality and source monitoring cybersecurity business development and growth data analysis employee development and training and other initiatives for example we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing deploying and maintaining customerfacing technologies applications to support field service and customer service operations water source sensor and evaluation technologies data analytics and hyperautomation technologies and artificial intelligence technologies where appropriate we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructure and systems there can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing developing deploying integrating or maintaining these new technologies because these efforts can be longterm in nature these new technologies may be more costly or timeconsuming than expected to design develop integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion while we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our regulated businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in every instance or at all and our inability to do so may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended om expense efficiencies or other key performance results and ultimately could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems or implement new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks or the implementation of new systems may require substantial amounts of management’s time and financial resources to complete and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors including employees’ ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system we continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions and have installed new and upgraded existing technology systems any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting we may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently although we make efforts to minimize any 

adverse impact on our controls business and operations we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated and any such impacts could harm our business individually or collectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

disruptions in our supply chain related to goods such as pipe chemicals fuel electricity equipment water and other raw materials and services could adversely impact our operations and our ability to serve our customers as well as our financial results 

our ability to serve our customers and operate our business in compliance with regulatory requirements is dependent upon purchasing or securing necessary goods and services from our suppliers and vendors these items include but are not limited to contracted services chemicals pipe valves hydrants fittings fuel equipment including personal protective equipment water and electricity examples of supply chain disruptions include reduced quantities of goods available in the marketplace delays in manufacturing or shipping goods labor shortages at our suppliers or vendors natural disasters and operational impacts to some of our suppliers or vendors disruptions in our supply chain related to goods and services have occurred and we anticipate will continue to occur into the foreseeable future supply chain disruptions may cause us to be unable to purchase or otherwise obtain needed goods or services at a reasonable price or at all and may significantly increase the price of goods and services we may obtain from suppliers and vendors this in turn may adversely impact our operations and our ability to serve our customers in compliance with regulatory requirements as well as our associated results of operations cash flows and financial condition while we attempt to plan for and have contingencies in place to address supply chain disruptions our mitigation efforts may not be successful or may have further negative impacts on us 

our business has inherently dangerous work sites if we fail to maintain safe work sites we may experience workforce or customer injuries or loss of life and be exposed to financial losses including penalties and other liabilities 

safety is a core value and a strategy at american water our safety performance and progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries are critical to our ability to carry out our operations effectively and to serve our customers and thereby to support our reputation we maintain health and safety practices to protect our employees customers contractors vendors and the public eliminating all hazards all of the time is extremely challenging but through strict adherence to our health and safety practices and empowering employees to be safety leaders who are expected to stop work if deemed “unsafe” we believe we can achieve an injuryfree workplace 

at our business sites including construction and maintenance sites our employees contractors and others are often in close proximity to large mechanical operating equipment moving vehicles pressurized water electric and gas utility lines below grade trenches and vaults electrical and pneumatic hazards fall from height hazards suspended loads hazardous chemicals and other regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement important safety procedures and practices above governmental regulatory requirements as an essential business that must continue to provide water and wastewater services during the covid19 pandemic we are focused on the health and safety of our employees contractors vendors customers and others who work at or visit our worksites if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others or we fail to implement procedures our employees contractors and others may experience illness or minor serious or fatal injuries unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our operations can involve the delivery handling storage use and disposal of hazardous chemicals which if improperly delivered handled stored used or disposed of could result in serious injury death environmental damage or property damage and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities we are also subject to various environmental transportation and occupational health and safety regulations although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective environmental health and safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization including construction sites and operating facilities the failure to comply with these regulations or procedures could subject us to liability 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations and the ability to serve our customers 

as of december 31 2021 approximately 47 of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 73 collective bargaining agreements in place with 14 different unions representing our unionized employees these collective bargaining agreements 21 of which will expire during 2022 are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation we may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts or enter into new agreements on terms that are acceptable to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may disrupt our operations negatively impact the ability to serve our customers and result in higher labor costs which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

financial economic and marketrelated risks 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2021 our aggregate longterm and shortterm debt balance including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 110 billion and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures 

• exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 

• limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations 

• impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity 

• requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing funds available for future operations dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures 

• limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt 

in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility or issue a combination of new shortterm and longterm debt securities andor equity we continue to assess our short and longterm liquidity needs in light of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the financial and capital markets especially with respect to the market for corporate commercial paper which experienced volatility and shortages of liquidity in march 2020 in response to these events in march 2020 we entered into a 750 million 364day term loan facility and immediately executed a 500 million draw thereunder to support our shortterm liquidity by retaining that amount in cash we repaid this term loan facility in full in march 2021 during 2021 we utilized other existing sources of liquidity such as our current cash balances cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility as necessary or desirable to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements we believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future however as the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the economy the financial and capital markets and our operations continue to evolve we will continue to assess our liquidity needs in the event of a sustained market deterioration we may need to obtain additional sources of liquidity which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions 

moreover additional borrowings may be required to repay or refinance outstanding indebtedness other than debt with respect to the term loan facility debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2022 2023 and 2024 will be 57 million 280 million and 474 million respectively we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms if at all to repay or refinance this debt moreover as new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to repay or refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

we have in the past entered into and in the future may enter into financial derivative instruments including without limitation interest rate swaps forward starting swaps and us treasury lock agreements see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk however these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance which will be affected by the financial business economic competitive legislative including tax initiatives and reforms and other similar legislation or regulation regulatory and other risk factors described in this section many of which are beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected materially and adversely 

our inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations during 2021 we generally relied primarily on a 225 billion revolving credit facility a 210 billion commercial paper program our 750 million 364day term loan facility which expired and was repaid in full in march 2021 and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs the revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in march 2025 historically we have regularly used our commercial paper program rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally could obtain in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 584 million of commercial paper outstanding and 76 million in outstanding letters of credit there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to access this commercial paper program or revolving credit facility when as and if desired or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable or any cost 

under the terms of the revolving credit facility our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70 of our consolidated capitalization as determined under the terms of the facility if our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed this limit lenders under the facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt thereunder immediately due and payable to avoid such a default a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties including events beyond our control for example events that could cause a reduction in equity include without limitation a significant writedown of our goodwill even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete 

disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all while the lending banks that participate in the revolving credit facility have to date honored their commitments under those facilities disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments in such a case we may not be able to access the commercial paper or debt or capital markets or other sources of potential liquidity in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under our revolving credit facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity short or longterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of economic legislative political or other uncertainty including as a result of the covid19 pandemic changes in us tax and other laws reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital debt or credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include delaying or deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures finally there is no assurance that we will be able to access the equity markets to obtain capital or financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us 

any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the debt or equity capital markets or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

parent company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds 

parent company is a holding company and as such it has no substantive operations of its own substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries parent company’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company prior to paying dividends to parent company our regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and our covenants and other agreements our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company a failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations 

we may not be able to fully utilize our state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2021 we had state nol carryforwards of approximately 123 million and management believes it is more likely than not that these nol carryforwards will be recovered in the future our state nol carryforwards began to expire in 2021 and will continue to expire through 2041 we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our state nol carryforwards and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the state nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our state nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include 11 billion of goodwill at december 31 2021 the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business these market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or other circumstances a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization the effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators 

market volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations and volatility which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates we are currently unable to predict the effect if any of the covid19 pandemic or other events on the valuation of our pension assets and liabilities a decline in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as of the measurement date can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates interest rates have experienced volatility and are subject to potential further adjustments based on the actions of the us federal reserve and others if interest rates are lower at the measurement date our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in assumptions such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that the discount rate used in our assumptions is reduced our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additional risks related to marketbased businesses 

parent company provides performance guarantees with respect to certain of the obligations of our marketbased businesses including financial guarantees or deposits which may adversely affect parent company if the guarantees are successfully enforced 

under the terms of certain agreements under which our marketbased businesses primarily msg provide water and wastewater services to municipalities and federal governmental entities parent company provides guarantees of specified performance obligations including financial guarantees or deposits in the event these obligations are not performed the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against parent company or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected at december 31 2021 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 62 billion related to msg’s contracts and this amount is likely to increase if the number of military bases served by msg increases the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 

msg’s operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the us government 

msg enters into contracts with the us government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems which contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to either an annual economic price adjustment or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter annual economic price adjustment is an inflation indexbased contract price increase mechanism price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

moreover entering into contracts with the us government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations we are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which are complex and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended or debarred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the us government or our existing contracts could be terminated which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

general risk factors 

new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the sec the financial accounting standards board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies or critical accounting estimates these changes are beyond our control can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which could also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure 

our internal controls accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap taxation requirements federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us we have also implemented corporate governance internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” and relevant sec rules as well as other applicable regulations such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and board of directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws rules and regulations management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls while we believe these controls policies practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity unanticipated or unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting the consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition the inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also harm our reputation increase financing costs or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers licensed operators water quality and other operating and craft personnel and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted

the 2009 order includes a condition prohibiting cal am from diverting water from the carmel river for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use in 2011 the california public utilities commission the “cpuc” issued a decision directing modifications in cal am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 order and directing cal am to seek written guidance from the swrcb with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition in 2012 the deputy director of the swrcb sent a letter to cal am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses in march 2018 the mpwmd adopted a resolution directing cal am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the swrcb’s written interpretation in may 2018 cal am notified the mpwmd and the swrcb that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 order in an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention cal am has met with the mpwmd and the swrcb several times the swrcb agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter which would be subject to a public comment period any failure to follow the mpwmd’s resolution or the swrcb’s written interpretation despite these conflicting interpretations could potentially result in fines penalties and other actions against cal am 

cal am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for the water supply project however there can be no assurance that the water supply project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis if ever beginning in january 2022 cal am expects to be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements contained in the 2016 order but continued compliance with the diversion reduction requirements for 2023 and future years will depend on successful development of alternate water supply sources sufficient to meet customer demand the 2009 order and the 2016 order remain in effect until cal am certifies to the swrcb and the swrcb concurs that cal am has obtained a permanent supply of water to substitute for past unauthorized carmel river diversions while the company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters further attempts to comply with the 2009 order and the 2016 order in the future may result in material additional costs and obligations to cal am including fines and penalties against cal am in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 order and the 2016 order 

monterey peninsula water supply project 

cpuc final approval of water supply project 

cal am’s ability to move forward on the water supply project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc and other government agencies obtaining necessary permits and intervention from other parties in september 2016 the cpuc unanimously approved a final decision to authorize cal am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the gwr project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to the incurred 50 million in associated costs plus afudc subject to meeting certain criteria 

in july 2019 cal am notified the mpwmd and monterey one water collectively the “agencies” that an event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement for the gwr project because the agencies failed to deliver to cal am by july 1 2019 advanced treated recycled water produced by the gwr project in its notification to the agencies cal am expressly reserved its right to terminate the water purchase agreement until the performance start date which was september 1 2020 as of june 30 2021 cal am determined that the agencies met their performance obligations under the water purchase agreement with respect to the first fiscal year of the contract 

in september 2018 the cpuc unanimously approved another final decision finding that the water supply project meets the cpuc’s requirements for a cpcn and an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects the cpuc’s 2018 decision concludes that the water supply project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in monterey and in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision adopts cal am’s cost estimates for the water supply project which amounted to an aggregate of 279 million plus afudc at a rate representative of cal am’s actual financing costs the 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of cal am’s prudently incurred costs associated with the water supply project upon its completion subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps om costs financing ratemaking and contingency matters the reasonableness of the water supply project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by cal am after it becomes operational cal am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the water supply project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program a reimbursement agreement for cpuc costs associated with that program and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the water supply project in service cal am has incurred 186 million in aggregate costs as of december 31 2021 related to the water supply project which includes 47 million in afudc 

table of contents 

in september 2021 cal am monterey one water and the mpwmd reached an agreement on cal am’s purchase of additional water from the expansion to the gwr project which is not expected to produce additional water until 2024 at the earliest the amended and restated water purchase agreement for the gwr project is subject to review and approval of the cpuc and on november 29 2021 cal am filed an application with the cpuc seeking review and approval of the amended and restated water purchase agreement cal am is also requesting rate base treatment of the additional capital investment for certain cal am facilities required to maximize the water supply from the expansion to the gwr project and a related aquifer storage and recovery project totaling approximately 81 million this amount is in addition to and consistent in regulatory treatment with the prior 50 million of recovery for facilities associated with the original water purchase agreement which was approved by the cpuc in its 2016 final decision 

while cal am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 order and the 2016 order as well as the cpuc’s 2016 and 2018 final decisions cal am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the water supply project and there can be no assurance that cal am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the 50 million in construction costs previously approved by the cpuc in its 2016 final decision see note 17—commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

coastal development permit application 

in june 2018 cal am submitted a coastal development permit application to the city of marina the “city” for those project components of the water supply project located within the city’s coastal zone members of the city’s planning commission as well as city councilpersons have publicly expressed opposition to the water supply project in may 2019 the city issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the planning commission of cal am’s coastal development permit application thereafter cal am appealed this decision to the coastal commission as permitted under the city’s code and the california coastal act at the same time cal am submitted an application to the coastal commission for a coastal development permit for those project components located within the coastal commission’s original jurisdiction in october 2019 staff of the coastal commission issued a report recommending a denial of cal am’s application for a coastal development permit with respect to the water supply project largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the mpwmd that contradicted findings made by the cpuc in its final decision approving the water supply project in november 2019 discussions between staffs of the coastal commission and the cpuc took place regarding the coastal commission staff recommendation at which time the cpuc raised questions about the coastal commission staff’s findings on water supply and demand groundwater impacts and the viability of a project that the coastal commission staff believes may be a possible alternative to the water supply project 

in august 2020 the staff of the coastal commission released a report again recommending denial of cal am’s application for a coastal development permit although the report concluded that the water supply project would have a negligible impact on groundwater resources the report also concluded it would impact other coastal resources such as environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and that the coastal commission staff believes that a feasible alternative project exists that would avoid those impacts the staff’s report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities of concern in september 2020 cal am withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the coastal commission staff’s environmental justice concerns the withdrawal of the original jurisdiction application did not impact cal am’s appeal of the city’s denial which remains pending before the coastal commission cal am refiled the original jurisdiction application in november 2020 in december 2020 the coastal commission sent to cal am a notice of incomplete application identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete 

in march 2021 cal am provided responses to the coastal commission’s notice of incomplete application on june 18 2021 the coastal commission responded acknowledging the responses and requesting certain additional information before the application could be considered complete cal am responded with the requested additional information on january 11 2022 and on february 8 2022 the coastal commission requested additional information the original jurisdiction application remains pending

in december 2018 the marina city council considered the proposed amendments cal am cemex and the coastal commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes but the city council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final which occurred at the city’s december 2018 meeting the changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the coastal commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained 

test slant well permitting 

a preliminary step to building the water supply project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under monterey bay in november 2014 the coastal commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well enabling cal am to construct and operate the test slant well because cal am may use the test slant well as one of the slant wells for the water supply project cal am sought and obtained from the coastal commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until february 23 2023 a required lease obtained from the california state lands commission as amended will expire on december 16 2022 effective february 28 2018 test slant well pumping ceased except for minimal maintenance pumping activities in accordance with cal am’s coastal development permits

in may 2020 the city filed a lawsuit in monterey county superior court naming cal am and cemex as defendants and mcwra and mcwd as real parties in interest the lawsuit as amended alleges a claim for breach of contract against cemex and seeks declaratory relief to void the permanent easement and prohibiting extraction of water by cal am’s slant wells at the cemex site in excess of 500 acrefeet per year and the export of such water outside the groundwater basin in november 2020 cal am cemex and mcwra filed demurrers which were overruled by the court at a hearing held on february 9 2021

liquidity and capital resources 

the company uses its capital resources including cash primarily to i fund operating and capital requirements ii pay interest and meet debt maturities iii pay dividends iv fund acquisitions v fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations and vi to pay federal income taxes which the company began to pay as a result of fully utilizing its nol carryforward in 2021 the company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a longterm return on investment additionally the company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag see item 1—business—regulated businesses— regulation and rate making for additional information the company expects to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since the company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities the company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of longterm debt and equity in addition to the proceeds from the sales of hos and the company’s new york subsidiary if necessary the company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity in this event the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

the company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments acquisitions operations commitments debt maturities interest and dividends the company’s business is capital intensive with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations when necessary the company also obtains funds from external sources primarily in the debt markets and through shortterm commercial paper borrowings in order to meet shortterm liquidity needs awcc issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility the company may also access the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements as needed the company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the utility and water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit the company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets 

if these unfavorable business market financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the company is no longer able to access the commercial paper andor capital markets on reasonable terms awcc has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in march 2025 with aggregate bank commitments of 225 billion the facility is used principally to fulfill the company’s shortterm liquidity needs by supporting awcc’s 210 billion commercial paper program and to provide a sublimit of up to 150 million for letters of credit subject to satisfying certain conditions the credit agreement permits awcc to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to 500 million as of december 31 2021 awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility with 159 billion available to fulfill its shortterm liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit 

to ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on debt and capital markets on march 20 2020 awcc entered into a term loan credit agreement by and among parent company awcc and the lenders party thereto the “term loan facility” the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes of awcc and american water and to provide additional liquidity the term loan facility commitments terminated at maturity on march 19 2021 and the term loan facility was repaid in full 

the company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the company’s shortterm requirements the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets however there can be no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to awcc under the revolving credit facility or that awcc will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all see credit facilities and shortterm debt below for additional information 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the warmer months the company’s future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by among other things customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner economic utility regulation inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs maintenance costs customer growth declining customer usage of water employeerelated costs including pension funding weather and seasonality taxes and overall economic conditions 

operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the company’s rate regulated environments changes in the marketbased businesses changes in the economy interest rates the timing of tax payments and the company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner among other items the company can provide no assurance that its customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future the company’s current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the use of shortterm debt as a funding source primarily to meet scheduled maturities of longterm debt fund acquisitions and construction projects as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business and other factors the company addresses cash timing differences primarily through its shortterm liquidity funding mechanisms 

presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the company’s cash flows from operating activities 



a includes provision for losses on accounts receivable pension and nonpension postretirement benefits and other noncash net details of each component can be found on the consolidated statements of cash flows 

b changes in working capital include changes to receivables and unbilled revenues accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other current assets and liabilities net less the settlement of cash flow hedges 

in 2021 cash flows provided by operating activities increased 15 million primarily due to an increase in net income changes in working capital primarily from an increase in accrued taxes and an increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service from capital infrastructure investments partially offsetting these increases was the gain on sale of businesses due to the gain on the sale of hos 

the company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of 37 million in 2022 in addition the company estimates that contributions will amount to 35 million 33 million 30 million and 27 million in 2023 2024 2025 and 2026 respectively actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns among other factors 

cash flows from investing activities 

presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the company’s cash flows from investing activities 



in 2021 cash flows used in investing activities decreased 525 million primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of hos and timing of payments for capital expenditures the company continues to invest across all infrastructure categories mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution and services meter and fire hydrants infrastructure in the company’s regulated businesses as discussed below 

the company’s infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where the company replaces infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where the company constructs new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations the company’s projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

presented in the table below is a summary of the company’s capital expenditures by category 



in 2021 the company’s capital expenditures decreased 58 million primarily due to a decrease in treatment and pumping and general structure and equipment infrastructure investment partially offset by increases in transmission and distribution and services meter and fire hydrants infrastructure investment 

the company also grows its business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems these acquisitions are generally located in geographic proximity to the company’s existing regulated businesses and support continued geographical diversification and growth of its operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with longterm financing during 2021 the company paid 112 million for the acquisition of 23 water and wastewater systems representing in the aggregate approximately 20000 customers and paid 23 million in deposits for future acquisitions 

as previously noted over the next five years the company expects to invest between 13 billion to 14 billion with 115 billion to 12 billion for infrastructure improvements in the regulated businesses and the company expects to invest between 28 billion to 32 billion over the next 10 years in 2022 the company expects to invest 25 billion consisting of 2 billion for infrastructure improvements and 500 million for acquisitions in the regulated businesses 

cash flows from financing activities

in 2021 cash flows provided by financing activities decreased 1465 million primarily due to the repayment in full at maturity of the 500 million term loan facility during the first quarter of 2021 an increase in net repayments of commercial paper borrowings higher dividends paid in 2021 and an increase in repayments of longterm debt due to the prepayment of 327 million in aggregate principal amount of awcc’s outstanding senior notes during the second quarter of 2021 

the company’s financing activities are primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures regulated acquisitions and payment of dividends these activities included the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc based on the needs of the regulated businesses and the company awcc may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then through intercompany loans provide those borrowings to the regulated businesses and parent company the regulated businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated businesses therefore parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates as of december 31 2021 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the regulated businesses amounting to 67 billion additionally as of december 31 2021 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to parent company amounting to 31 billion 

on may 10 2021 awcc completed a 11 billion debt offering which included the sale of 550 million aggregate principal amount of its 230 senior notes due 2031 and 550 million aggregate principal amount of its 325 senior notes due 2051 at the closing of the offering awcc received after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses net proceeds of 1086 million awcc used the net proceeds of this offering i to lend funds to parent company and its regulated subsidiaries ii to prepay 251 million aggregate principal amount of awcc’s outstanding 577 series d senior notes due december 21 2021 the “series d notes” and 76 million aggregate principal amount of awcc’s outstanding 655 series h senior notes due may 15 2023 the “series h notes” and together with the series d notes the “series notes” iii to repay awcc’s commercial paper obligations and iv for general corporate purposes after the prepayments described above none of the series d notes and approximately 14 million aggregate principal amount of the series h notes remain outstanding as a result of awcc’s prepayment of the series notes a makewhole premium of 15 million was paid to the holders thereof on june 14 2021 substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to the company’s utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets as the company believes they are probable of recovery in future rates 

one of the principal market risks to which the company is exposed is changes in interest rates in order to manage the exposure the company follows risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps the company also reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities the company does not enter into derivative contracts through awcc for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments the derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations the company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by dealing only with leading creditworthy financial institutions having longterm credit ratings of “a” or better 

on may 10 2021 the company terminated two treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 275 million realizing a net gain of less than 1 million to be amortized through interest net over a tenyear period in accordance with the terms of the new debt issued on may 10 2021 no ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020

presented in the table below are the issuances of longterm debt in 2021 



a this indebtedness is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and awcc which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of awcc’s payment obligations under such indebtedness see “—issuer and guarantor of senior notes” below 

presented in the table below are the retirements and redemptions of longterm debt in 2021 through sinking fund provisions optional redemption or payment at maturity 



from time to time and as market conditions warrant the company may engage in longterm debt retirements through makewhole redemptions tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives 

issuer and guarantor of senior notes 

the outstanding senior notes issued by awcc the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company have been issued under two indentures each by and between awcc and wells fargo bank national association as trustee providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the notes issued thereunder the senior notes also have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement as amended between parent company and awcc which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of awcc’s payment obligations under the senior notes no other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of the outstanding senior notes if awcc is unable to make timely payment of any interest principal or premium if any on such senior notes parent company will provide to awcc at its request or the request of any holder of such senior notes funds to make such payment in full if awcc fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if awcc defaults in the timely payment of any amounts owed to any holder of such senior notes when due the support agreement provides that the holder may proceed directly against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder 

as a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company awcc has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its subsidiaries in its regulated businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by awcc awcc’s ability to make payments of amounts owed to holders of the senior notes will be dependent upon awcc’s receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future the proceeds of which would be used to fund the repayment of the senior notes 

because parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than awcc parent company’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from its operating subsidiaries see note 10—shareholders’ equity—dividends and distributions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions furthermore parent company’s operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and other than awcc have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any funds for such payment other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans if any with awcc based on the foregoing parent company’s obligations under the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables lease commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent company’s subsidiaries other than awcc 

credit facilities and shortterm debt 

interest rates on advances under the company’s revolving credit facility are based on a credit spread to the libor rate or applicable market replacement rate or base rate in accordance with moody investors service’s and standard  poor’s financial services’ then applicable credit rating on awcc’s senior unsecured noncredit enhanced debt the facility is used principally to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 150 million in letters of credit indebtedness under the facility and awcc’s commercial paper are considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and awcc which serves as a functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of awcc’s payment obligations thereunder 

presented in the tables below are the aggregate credit facility commitments commercial paper limit and letter of credit availability under the revolving credit facility as well as the available capacity for each as of december 31 



a total remaining availability of 159 billion as of december 31 2021 may be accessed through revolver draws 



a total remaining availability may be accessed through revolver draws 

presented in the table below is the company’s total available liquidity as of december 31 2021 and 2020 



the weighted average interest rate on awcc shortterm borrowings including as of december 31 2020 500 million of outstanding principal on the term loan facility was approximately 025 and 116 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

capital structure 

presented in the table below is the percentage of the company’s capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of december 31 



the changes in the capital structure mix between periods were mainly attributable to the impacts of the hos sale repayment of the term loan facility at maturity on march 19 2021 and the company’s longterm debt offering that was completed on may 10 2021 

debt covenants 

the company’s debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that the company is not in compliance with these covenants an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the company or its subsidiaries may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility the longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things prohibit or restrict the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations 

covenants in certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization as defined in the relevant documents of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2021 the company’s ratio was 060 to 100 and therefore the company was in compliance with the covenants 

security ratings 

presented in the table below are longterm and shortterm credit ratings and rating outlooks as of february 16 2022 as issued by the following rating agencies 



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans the company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings none of the company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility 

as part of its normal course of business the company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if the company is downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that the company must provide collateral to secure its obligations the company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets may be directly affected by the company’s securities ratings the company primarily accesses the debt capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however the company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of mortgage bonds and tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds to lower the overall cost of debt 

dividends and regulatory restrictions 

for discussion of the company’s dividends dividend restrictions and dividend policy see note 10—shareholders’ equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

insurance coverage 

the company carries various property casualty cyber and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims additionally annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a goingforward basis the company is selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company’s shortterm and longterm financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates assumptions and judgments that could affect the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates assumptions and judgments management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the company’s audit finance and risk committee including the estimates assumptions and judgments used in their application additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in note 2—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulation and regulatory accounting 

the company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by pucs and as such the company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities which requires the company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its consolidated financial statements use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria i thirdparty regulation of rates ii costbased rates and iii a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service plus a return on net investment or rate base as of december 31 2021 the company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria 

application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process the company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities such judgments include but are not limited to assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions pension and postretirement benefits depreciation rates and taxes due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a nonregulated entity to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates conversely the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where the company conducts business the company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments recent rate orders including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pending or potential legislation if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement the company’s consolidated statements of operations and financial position could be materially affected in addition if the company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria the company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the company’s consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the company’s regulatory asset balance was 11 billion and its regulatory liability balance was 16 billion and 18 billion respectively see note 4—regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

accounting for income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and the utilization of nol carryforwards 

in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance the company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not morelikelythannot that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits no benefit is recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

the company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets the company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements the company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

under gaap specifically accounting standards codification topic 740 income taxes “asc 740” the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted asc 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled thus at the date of enactment of the tcja the company’s deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new tax rate for the company’s regulated entities the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability and may be subject to refund to customers for the company’s unregulated operations the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a noncash remeasurement adjustment to earnings 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the regulated businesses as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2021 and 2020 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance however the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 15—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

the company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations see note 16—employee benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

• discount rate—the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future the objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due 

• expected return on plan assets “eroa”—management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance but primarily based upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the longterm returns on those asset classes these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the company records currently 

• rate of compensation increase—management projects employees’ pay increases which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement 

• health care cost trend rate—management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 

• mortality— management adopted the society of actuaries pri2012 mortality base table the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new mp2021 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012 

the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices the company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 294 274 and 344 at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 290 256 and 336 at december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

in selecting an eroa the company considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 650 for 2021 650 for 2020 and 620 for 2019 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 367 for 2021 368 for 2020 and 356 for 2019

on august 31 2018 the postretirement medical benefit plan was remeasured as a result of an announced plan amendment which changed benefits for certain union and nonunion plan participants the plan change resulted in a 175 million reduction in future benefits payable to plan participants and in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement date resulted in a 227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2021 the remaining amortization period of the impact of the plan amendment is 69 years as a result of the remeasurement and change in funded status the company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability plan assets in excess of those securities designed to match the longterm liabilities are invested in shorter duration fixed income securities and equities 

presented in the table below are the allocations of the other postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category 



a includes the american water postretirement medical benefits bargaining plan the american water postretirement medical benefits nonbargaining plan and the american water life insurance trust 

the investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds commingled funds and limited partnerships the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase the company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates the company’s rate of compensation increase was 351 for 2021 351 for 2020 and 297 for 2019 

in selecting health care cost trend rates the company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs as of january 1 2021  the company’s health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 625 in 2021 gradually declining to 500 in 2026 and thereafter as of december 31 2021 the company projects that medical inflation will be 600 in 2022 gradually declining to 500 in 2026 and thereafter 

the company will use a discount rate and eroa of 294 and 650 respectively for estimating its 2022 pension costs additionally the company will use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 290 and 360 respectively for estimating its 2022 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase the company’s pension expense the company’s 2021 pension and postretirement benefit credit was 41 million and the 2020 pension and postretirement benefit credit was 14 million the company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of 37 million in 2022 and 35 million 33 million 30 million and 27 million in 2023 2024 2025 and 2026 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the company’s regulated businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers these contracts contain a single performance obligation the delivery of water or wastewater services as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and therefore is not distinct revenues are recognized over time as services are provided there are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill to the end of the accounting period the amounts that the company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer 

increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue in addition changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation unbilled revenue for the company’s regulated utilities as of december 31 2021 and 2020 was 162 million and 150 million respectively 

the company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process 

revenue from the company’s former hos business was generated through various protection programs in which the company provided fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines interior electric and gas lines heating and cooling systems water heaters power surge protection and other related services most of the contracts had a oneyear term and each service was a separate performance obligation satisfied over time as the customers simultaneously received and consumed the benefits provided from the service customers were obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a onetime annual fee with revenues recognized ratably over time for those services advances from customers were deferred until the performance obligation was satisfied 

the company also has longterm fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the us government on various military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the company additionally these contracts allow the company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract whereby standalone fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement the company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined unbilled revenue for the marketbased businesses as of december 31 2021 and 2020 was 86 million and 56 million respectively 

accounting for contingencies 

the company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated the determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter which may include an analysis of different scenarios liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible management considers many factors which include but are not limited to the nature of the litigation claim or assessment review of applicable law opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors and the experience gained from similar cases or situations the company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred the company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined either as a single amount or within a reasonable range 

actual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements see note 17—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingencies

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates the company is exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates the company also has the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with the company’s shortterm borrowings would result in a 8 million increase in shortterm interest expense 

the company’s risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of the company’s common stock may experience fluctuations which may be unrelated to its operating performance in particular the company’s stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for the company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its common stock or other equity securities regardless of its financial performance and such difficulty may preclude the company from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

the company is exposed to credit risk through its water wastewater and other waterrelated services provided by the regulated businesses and marketbased businesses the company’s regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while the marketbased businesses engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers the company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances the company’s credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements the company’s credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition the regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities the company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixedincome securities that have a duration similar to that of its pension liabilities seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities that way if interest rates fall and liabilities increase the company expects that the fixedincome assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value the company also expects its risk to be reduced through its ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates 

the company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates the credit quality of the company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore the company’s ability to fully recover operating expense recover its investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in the regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

 item 1 business 

the company 

with a history dating back to 1886 american water is the largest and most geographically diverse publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the united states as measured by both operating revenues and population served a holding company originally incorporated in delaware in 1936 the company employs approximately 7000 professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to over 15 million people in 46 states the company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services collectively presented as the “regulated businesses” the company also operates marketbased businesses that provide complementary services individually these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and are collectively presented as the “marketbased businesses” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses 

throughout this form 10k unless the context otherwise requires references to “we” “us” “our” the “company” and “american water” mean american water works company inc and its subsidiaries taken together as a whole references to “parent company” mean american water works company inc without its subsidiaries 

regulated businesses 

the company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial public authority fire service and sale for resale customers the company’s utilities operate in over 1700 communities in 16 states in the united states with 35 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks services provided by the company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation collectively referred to as public utility commissions “pucs” federal state and local governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality and water accountability matters the company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in the regulated businesses segment operating revenues for the regulated businesses were 3255 million for 2020 3094 million for 2019 and 2984 million for 2018 accounting for 86 86 and 87 respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods 

presented in the table below is a geographic summary of the regulated businesses’ operating revenues and the number of customers the company serves by type of service for and as of the year ended december 31 2020 



a includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges fees and rents 

b the company’s “top seven states” are determined based upon operating revenues 

c includes the company’s utility operations in the following states georgia hawaii iowa kentucky maryland michigan new york tennessee and virginia and other revenue attributable collectively to the regulated businesses 

table of contents 

customers 

the company’s regulated businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base a customer is defined as a person business municipality or any other entity that purchases the company’s water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period one single customer may purchase the company’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses examples of these customers are homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities 

the vast majority of the company’s regulated water customers are metered which allows the company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage typically on a monthly basis the company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption these methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption 

residential customers make up a substantial portion of the company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates the company also serves i commercial customers such as food and beverage providers commercial property developers and proprietors and energy suppliers ii fire service customers where the company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities iii industrial customers such as largescale manufacturers mining and production operations iv public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools and universities and v other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers 

the following chart depicts the allocation of the company’s regulated businesses’ operating revenue of 3255 million by type including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer for the year ended december 31 2020 

a includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community water systems under bulk contracts 

b includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges fees and rents 

table of contents 

presented in the table below is the number of water and wastewater customers the company served by class as of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 which represents approximately 15 million people served as of december 31 2020 



a includes public authorities and other utilities and community water and wastewater systems under bulk contracts bulk contracts which are accounted for as a single customer in the table above generally result in service to multiple customers 

customer growth in the company’s regulated businesses is primarily from i adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water andor wastewater utility systems ii population growth in its authorized service areas and iii sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems 

capital investment 

the company plans to invest between 22 billion and 25 billion over the next 10 years including acquisitions for capital improvements to its regulated businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities the company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 110year replacement cycle by 2025 which it anticipates will enable the company to replace nearly 2200 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2021 and 2025 in addition from 2021 to 2025 the company’s capital investment in treatment plants storage tanks and other key aboveground facilities is expected to increase further addressing infrastructure renewal resiliency water quality operational efficiency technology and innovation and emerging regulatory compliance needs additionally the company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets recently completed projects include a 15 million emergency power generation system installation at new jersey’s raritan millstone water treatment plant which provides automated standby power in the event of a power failure and 23 million and 27 million water treatment plant improvement projects to retire obsolete pumping and water treatment facilities located in 100year floodplains in both muncie and richmond indiana respectively 

regulation and rate making 

the operations of the company’s regulated businesses are generally subject to regulation by pucs in the states in which they operate with the primary responsibility of the pucs being the promotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs review and approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital operation and maintenance “om” expenses capital expenditures taxes affiliated transactions and relationships reorganizations mergers and acquisitions and dispositions along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives regulatory policies vary from state to state and can change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the puc the timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions the company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag” which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and the recognition in rates of that change 

table of contents 

the company’s regulated businesses support regulatory practices at the pucs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices 



the company pursues enhancements to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments and to continue to provide safe clean reliable and affordable services to its customers the ability to seek regulatory treatment using the regulatory practices described above does not guarantee that the pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these regulatory practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes it is also the company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply and enhance certain mechanisms where they already exist 

acquisitions and strategic growth 

the us water and wastewater industries include investorowned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions according to the us environmental protection agency “epa” as of 2017 approximately 84 of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98 of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned the epa also estimates as of 2017 that there are approximately 50000 community water systems and approximately 15000 community wastewater systems in the united states with approximately 80 of the community water systems serving a population of 3000 or less 

a fundamental aspect of the company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of water andor wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the company operates its regulated businesses the proximity of acquisition opportunities to the company’s regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using the company’s existing management although the company typically retains the majority if not all of the employees of the acquired systems and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs the company’s current customer mix of 93 water and 7 wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation allowing the company to add wastewater customers where it already serves water customers the company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and if appropriate pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the company does not currently operate its regulated businesses before entering new regulated markets the company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to its customers as well as a line of sight to grow the company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market 

increasingly stringent environmental health and safety and water quality and water accountability regulations the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements among others that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets

sale of new york american water company inc 

on november 20 2019 the company and the company’s new york subsidiary entered into a stock purchase agreement the “stock purchase agreement” with liberty utilities co which it subsequently assigned to its indirect wholly owned subsidiary liberty utilities eastern water holdings corp “liberty” pursuant to which liberty will purchase all of the capital stock of the new york subsidiary the “stock purchase” for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 608 million in cash subject to adjustment as provided in the stock purchase agreement the company’s regulated new york operations have approximately 125000 customers in the state of new york algonquin power  utilities corp liberty’s ultimate parent company executed and delivered an absolute and unconditional guaranty of the performance of the obligations of liberty under the stock purchase agreement the stock purchase is subject to various conditions including obtaining approvals and satisfying or waiving other closing conditions the stock purchase agreement has an initial termination date of june 30 2021 either party may extend the agreement beyond june 30 2021 and the company intends to extend the agreement if necessary provided all of the conditions to closing have been or are capable of being met other than obtaining regulatory approvals if not otherwise extended the ultimate termination date is december 31 2021 liberty may also terminate the stock purchase agreement if any governmental authority initiates a condemnation or eminent domain proceeding against a majority of the consolidated properties of the new york subsidiary taken as a whole 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 the governor of new york proposed legislation that among other things requires the new york state department of public service “nysdps” to study whether private water suppliers should be placed under municipal control on february 3 2021 the governor issued a press release announcing that he directed the nysdps special counsel to commence and lead a municipalization feasibility study to be completed by april 1 2021 meanwhile the company’s new york subsidiary continues to work constructively with the nysdps and is taking the actions necessary to complete the stock purchase subject to satisfying or waiving the various conditions to closing and assuming no prior termination of the stock purchase agreement by liberty as described above the company remains confident that the stock purchase will be completed though the date of the close of the transaction could be impacted by the timing of the work to be completed by the nysdps special counsel 

industry legislation 

in 2017 new jersey enacted the water quality accountability act the “wqaa” which sets operational standards for all water utilities in new jersey including municipal and investorowned utilities with more than 500 service connections this law imposes requirements in areas such as cybersecurity asset management water quality reporting remediation of notices of violation and hydrant and valve maintenance the wqaa requires the most senior water manager or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems to certify that the system meets the requirements under the wqaa in an effort to strengthen accountability under the wqaa the new jersey senate held three hearings on the wqaa during 2020 the new jersey assembly has also heard legislation to strengthen the wqaa in one committee and referral to the assembly appropriations committee is pending 

the company’s regulated subsidiaries in california illinois indiana iowa maryland missouri new jersey pennsylvania and virginia have access to fair market value legislation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems the company supports full optionality for municipalities including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through thirdparty fair market valuations of purchased property fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation which allows the company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assets that is reflective of the assets’ fair market value while providing the company with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets subject to puc approval 

in 2020 legislation in indiana was passed that created an appraisal process to establish fair value for nonmunicipal utilities and a presumption that a purchase price not exceeding the appraised value is reasonable that legislation also requires that all new municipal water and wastewater systems are subject to the jurisdiction of the utility regulatory commission for ten years separate legislation authorizes recovery for above ground infrastructure without a full rate case for service enhancements that are completed for health safety or environmental concerns that same legislation also removed relocations completed for road construction from the distribution system improvement charge recovery caps 

consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a state as a result consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state overall the company believes that consolidated tariffs bring costeffective high quality services to a larger number of customers twelve of the company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing including california illinois indiana iowa kentucky maryland missouri new jersey new york pennsylvania virginia and west virginia 

table of contents 

in 2020 legislation in west virginia was passed that allows for expanded asset valuation in connection with the acquisition of a utility or utility assets combined water and wastewater revenue requirements and the expansion of permitted uses by municipalities of proceeds from the sale of a water or wastewater system the legislation also allows inclusion of contributed property in a system’s asset valuation and rate base recognition for the full purchase price approved by the public service commission of west virginia 

in december 2020 congress passed and the president signed into law a 900 billion covid19 relief and 14 trillion us government appropriations package for 2021 which included 638 million for a lowincome water assistance program and 28 billion for capitalization grants under the clean water and drinking water state revolving funds the company is awaiting further guidance on the distribution of these funds 

competition 

the company’s regulated businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because i the company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises charters certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations collectively “cpcns” issued by state pucs or other authorities and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry however the company’s regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions when pursuing acquisitions the company’s largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served include essential utilities inc formerly known as aqua america inc suez north america american states water company and california water service group from time to time the company also faces competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as algonquin power and utilities corp eversource energy and corix 

condemnation and eminent domain 

all or portions of the regulated businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods i eminent domain also known as condemnation ii the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original cpcn was granted and iii the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its cpcn the acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular cpcn 

as such the regulated businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business for example a citizens group in monterey california successfully added “measure j” to the november 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the monterey peninsula water management district the “mpwmd” should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of the monterey water service system assets the “monterey system assets” of the company’s california subsidiary and if feasible to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote this service territory represents approximately 40000 customers in november 2018 measure j was certified to have passed in august 2019 the mpwmd’s general manager issued a report that recommends that the mpwmd board 1 develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition 2 examine the feasibility of acquiring the monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the mpwmd becomes the owner of a larger system 3 evaluate whether the acquisition of the monterey system assets by the mpwmd is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of “feasible” as provided in measure j 4 ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition and 5 develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a resolution of necessity 

in november 2019 the mpwmd issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report finding in part that 1 an estimate of the monterey system assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately 513 million 2 the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills and 3 the acquisition of the monterey system assets by the mpwmd would be economically feasible on june 12 2020 the mpwmd issued a draft environmental impact report for the potential acquisition of the monterey system assets and a related district boundary adjustment that would be required if the mpwmd were to acquire and operate certain of the monterey system assets located outside the mpwmd’s boundaries on september 15 2020 the mpwmd gave notice of its intention to appraise the monterey system assets and related property interests on september 29 2020 the company’s california subsidiary declined to make the monterey system assets and related property interests available for inspection or to comply with any of the other requests contained in the mpwmd’s notice on october 7 2020 the mpwmd issued a final environmental impact report “feir” and on november 4 2020 the mpwmd certified the feir which purports to analyze the environmental impacts of the mpwmd’s project to 1 acquire the monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain if necessary and 2 expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system on november 25 2020 the company’s california subsidiary filed a petition challenging this certification in court see item 3—legal proceedings—challenge of certification—proposed monterey system final environmental impact report

the mpwmd will be required to file an application with the local agency formation commission of monterey county “lafco” seeking approval to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 56 parcels of land into the mpwmd’s boundaries approval by lafco is a precondition to the mpwmd’s ability to file an eminent domain proceeding against the company’s california subsidiary to acquire the monterey system assets if the mpwmd were to make a final determination that an acquisition of the monterey system assets is feasible it would then need to file a multiyear eminent domain proceeding against the company’s california subsidiary in that proceeding it would first need to establish its right to take the monterey system assets if such right is established the amount of just compensation to be paid to the california subsidiary for such assets would then need to be determined 

also five municipalities in the chicago illinois area approximately 30300 customers in total formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against the company’s illinois subsidiary in january 2013 seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities before filing its eminent domain lawsuit the water agency made an offer of 38 million for the pipeline the parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports although the date of the valuation trial is not currently scheduled it is not likely to commence until the second quarter of 2021 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which the regulated businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently in california lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property in some cases the puc has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed also the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance 

water supply and wastewater services 

the company’s regulated businesses generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to its customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater typically the company does not own the water which is held in public trust and is allocated to the company through contracts permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multistate agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law the company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from groundwater sources such as wells and aquifers and water purchased from thirdparty water suppliers the level of water treatment the company applies varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only 

table of contents 

presented in the chart below are the company’s sources of water supply as of december 31 2020 

presented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the company’s top seven states for the year ended december 31 2020 



the company’s ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water the company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of the company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes it might encounter in any particular service territory for example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas the company serves may experience wetter than average weather 

table of contents 

the company evaluates quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity to provide water service to its customers water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that the company has adequate water supply it uses longterm planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources the company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development an example of the company’s use of longterm planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” in california the water supply project includes the construction of a desalination plant to be owned by the company’s california subsidiary and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant in addition the water supply project also includes the california subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” between monterey one water formerly known as the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the mpwmd the water supply project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of the california subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under orders of the california state water resources control board the “swrcb” for more information see item 3—legal proceedings—alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions and note 17—commitments and contingencies—contingencies—alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

seasonality 

customer demand for the company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use as such the company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year weather that is hotter andor drier than average generally increases operating revenues whereas weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues three of the company’s jurisdictions california illinois and new york have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the company to collect state pucauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period thereby lessening the impact of weather variability see regulated businesses—regulation and rate making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms 

marketbased businesses 

the company’s marketbased businesses provide home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers and water and wastewater services to the us government on military installations as well as municipalities and utility customers these businesses are not subject to regulation by state pucs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment operating revenues for the company’s marketbased businesses were 540 million for 2020 539 million for 2019 and 476 million for 2018 accounting for 14 15 and 14 respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods 

the company’s primary marketbased businesses include the following operating segments 

• homeowner services group “hos” which provides various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers 

• military services group “msg” which enters into longterm contracts with the us government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations 

the company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its contract services group “csg” 

table of contents 

homeowner services group 

the company’s homeowner services group which includes the operations of pivotal home solutions “pivotal” acquired in june 2018 provides warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines interior gas and electric lines heating and cooling systems water heaters and other home appliances as well as power surge protection and other related services the company develops partnerships with municipalities utilities and other organizations to offer protection programs to customers serviced by or affiliated with those municipalities utilities and organizations the term of these partnership agreements with the municipalities utilities and other organizations is typically three to five years with mutual optional renewals as of december 31 2020 hos had approximately 3 million customer contracts in 43 states 

military services group 

the company’s military services group operates on 17 military installations under 50year contracts with the us government as part of its utilities privatization program the scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and in certain instances systems expansion the replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to msg is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract traditionally both of these programs are funded from the contract fee at times new assets are required to support the installation’s mission and the construction of these assets is funded by the us government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract the capital for these assets historically has not been funded through the company’s debt or equity issuances rather the company has used limited working capital for shortterm needs under these contracts in april 2018 the us army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing contracts but the us army’s implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing however recent us army and navy utilities privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five or tenyear period after project completion three of msg’s current contracts require such capital project financing which the company is currently addressing through internal sources of liquidity 

the contract price for six of msg’s contracts with the us government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions the remaining 11 contracts with the us government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism called “economic price adjustment” all 17 contracts could be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the msg subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts msg would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs msg’s backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the us government is approximately 62 billion with an average remaining contract term of 41 years 

competition 

the company’s marketbased businesses face competition from a number of service providers including homeserve usa and cinch home services in hos and american states water company suez north america and veolia environnement sa in msg 

environmental health and safety water quality and other regulation 

the company’s water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both its regulated businesses and marketbased businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water the company delivers to its customers and the manner in which it collects treats discharges recycles and disposes of wastewater in the united states these regulations are developed under federal legislation including the safe drinking water act the reduction of lead in drinking water act and the clean water act and under a variety of applicable state laws environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard for example while the epa has issued a nonenforceable health advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds perfluorooctanoic acid or pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate or pfos the new jersey department of environmental protection was the first state agency to establish a standard for perfluorononanoic acid or pfna in 2018 and has since established maximum containment levels for pfoa and pfos with implementation occurring in january 2021 the company is also subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the company delivers 

table of contents 

the company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices focused on compliance with environmental laws and regulations and the effective use of natural resources recognizing that drinking water standards have generally over time increased in number and become increasingly more stringent as newer or stricter standards are introduced the company’s capital and operating costs needed to comply with them will likely increase the company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental health and safety and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues the company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately 725 million over the next five years including 155 million in 2021 for environmental control facilities which the company defines for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land the company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations 

the company’s operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example the company’s water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements the company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its offsite disposal of wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” authorizes the epa and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under cercla or comparable state laws although the company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs to the company the company’s facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the us occupational safety and health act and inspections thereunder 

safe drinking water act 

the safe drinking water act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements to date the epa has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water quality indicators for drinking water and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years 

to help formulate the basis for future regulations the epa has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule the “monitoring rule” the company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the monitoring rule in previous rounds which occurs every five years including the fourth round that concluded at the end of 2020 there are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which lack a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor cost effective treatment options the process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex but the company actively participates with the epa and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge see research and development—contaminants of emerging concern for additional information 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial contaminants the epa has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants andor the byproducts of their use in the disinfection process examples of these rules are the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule the “longterm 2 rule” the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule and the ground water rule which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources in 2016 the revised total coliform rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects the company is within the epa’s time frame for compliance with all of these standards which includes sample collection data analysis and in some instances engineering planning and implementation of treatment enhancements recent monitoring as required by the longterm 2 rule has indicated that approximately 30 of the company’s surface water systems have recently completed or need to implement additional disinfection protection mechanisms against cryptosporidium in many cases this will involve installing ultraviolet light disinfection systems and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades an estimated 150 million to 250 million of investment will still be required to upgrade the remaining facilities for cryptosporidium disinfection further the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds the company does not anticipate that any such regulations if enacted will require implementation in 2021 

table of contents 

the company conducted over ten million water quality and turbidity tests in 2020 at its laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water the company participates in the partnership for safe water the epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 68 of the company’s 79 surface water treatment plants receiving the epa program’s prestigious “director” award which recognizes utilities that i have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report ii created an action plan for continuous improvement and iii produced highquality drinking water the company accounts for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 66 of the company’s surface water treatment plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award 61 plants have received the “tenyear phase iii” award 57 plants have received the “fifteenyear phase iii” award and 26 plants have received the “twentyyear phase iii” award these awards recognize plants that have met the director award status for five 10 15 and 20 years respectively further nine of the company’s surface water plants have received the “presidents” award which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements the company expects current cost requirements under the safe drinking water act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result the company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

lead and copper rule and reduction of lead in drinking water act 

in 1991 the epa published the lead and copper rule “lcr” to control lead and copper in drinking water and since that time has issued minor revisions in 2000 2004 and 2007 enhancing monitoring reporting and public education requirements in 2011 congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings for fixtures solder and flux while these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water legacy lead plumbing materials primarily in building plumbing still remain in many communities the failure of certain water systems in the united states to comply with the requirements of the lcr has received recent media attention and scrutiny and in certain cases has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects the company has started to replace lead service lines “lsls” in accordance with current scientific guidance also the company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements the epa finalized revisions to the lcr the “revised lcr” on january 15 2021 that are designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water the company is in the process of reviewing the revised lcr and will be developing an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements which are mandated by january 2024 capital expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisions cannot be presently determined until the company’s review of the new rule is completed but as previously noted costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates 

the company currently estimates that less than 5 of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the company or customer portion of the service line the company is replacing lsls as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects the company’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known lsls in most of its service areas by the end of 2030 at an estimated cost ranging from 600 million to 12 billion the company believes this will be attainable for most of its service areas where public policy is supportive of this goal with regard to future acquisitions the company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set lsl removal goals appropriate for those systems the prioritization of lsl removal is dependent on several factors including the company’s planned water main and service line renewal projects adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities lcr compliance monitoring results and cooperation with its customers with respect to replacing the customerowned portion of the lsl as necessary in certain cases these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement because replacing the external lsl in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the us national drinking water advisory council the lead service line replacement collaborative and the american water works association the company’s preferred approach is to replace the entire external lsl if lead is found on either the company or customer portion of the service line full lsl replacement is also consistent with the revised lcr the lead service line replacement collaborative is a diverse group of public health water utility environmental labor consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of lsls through collaborative efforts at the local level

the company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborates with the epa and state agencies to help establish effective environmental health and safety and water quality standards and regulations this relationship includes the sharing of the company’s research such as its treatment and distribution system optimization research and its national water quality monitoring data the company’s engagement with the epa provides it with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing the company to anticipate and to accommodate its future compliance requirements the company also frequently engages with the centers for disease control other state environmental agencies and national and international water research foundations the company believes that continued rd activities are critical for providing safe reliable and affordable services as well as maintaining its leadership position in the industry which provides the company with a competitive advantage as it seeks business and operational growth 

contaminants of emerging concern 

contaminants of emerging concern include numerous chemicals such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides herbicides endocrine disrupting compounds and industrial chemicals as well as certain naturally occurring microbes such as bacteria viruses and parasites which have been detected in drinking water supplies for which the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood andor has not been assessed technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of these contaminants at trace levels the ability to detect contaminants even at trace levels has invited discussion about these contaminants among regulators and government agencies which in turn shapes the public’s perception of drinking water quality 

the chemicals abstract service registry contains over 173 million registered chemicals with an estimated 1400 species of diseasecausing microbes that can affect humans the company is continually investigating new substances and contaminants employing a team of scientists engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to its water supply to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies the company utilizes water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help detect potential water supply contamination issues examples of the company’s efforts include 

• monitoring impacts of the covid19 pandemic on environmental virus loads and removal efforts through wastewater systems 

• characterizing factors that contribute to the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection byproducts to define best practices for their mitigation 

• using its research findings to communicate information to its customers regarding potential actions to limit occurrences of legionella in their buildings in this regard the centers for disease control statistics indicate that waterassociated disease from legionella is on the rise with exposure typically associated with customerowned plumbing systems in large buildings

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following material factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business operations 

our utility operations are subject to extensive regulation by state pucs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our utility operations also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for an inability to meet these regulatory requirements 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state pucs this regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us with the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to 

• cover our expenses including purchased water and costs of chemicals fuel and other commodities used in our operations 

• enable us to recover our investment and 

• provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment 

approval of the pucs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations some state pucs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations our utilities are also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the pucs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions dispositions debt andor equity financing and in certain cases affiliated transactions although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business 

the current covid19 pandemic may limit or curtail significantly or entirely the ability of pucs to approve or authorize applications and other requests we may make with respect to our regulated businesses including without limitation any or all types of approvals described above as pucs and their staffs seek to reduce delay or streamline proceedings and other activities pucs and other governmental authorities have taken and may continue to take emergency or other actions in light of the covid19 pandemic that may impact us including prohibiting the termination of service for nonpayment during the current covid19 pandemic and extending or delaying procedural schedules in our regulatory proceedings at this time we are unable to predict the range of impacts that the covid19 pandemic and other related events may have on our ability to obtain these approvals as needed or requested by the regulated businesses in the ordinary course or at all or the nature of any further emergency or other action that may be taken by the pucs or other governmental authorities 

in any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if the rates approved are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to water usage less than the level anticipated in establishing rates customers increase their conservation efforts or we experience negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the levels estimated in establishing rates 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations including with respect to contaminants of emerging concern compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs as well as damage to our reputation 

our regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our marketbased businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations these requirements include among others cercla the clean water act the safe drinking water act the lcr and other federal and state requirements for example state pucs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers 

table of contents 

that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves providing water service for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

in addition cercla authorizes the epa to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our regulated businesses through customer rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination including potential releases of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

attention is being given to contaminants of emerging concern including without limitation chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances examples of sources of contaminants include but are not limited to newly created chemical compounds including for example manufactured nanomaterials human and veterinary products perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds bacteria microbes viruses including the current novel coronavirus amoebae and other pathogens and residual byproducts of disinfection we rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants and our role is to provide service that meets these standards if any in some of our states pucs may disapprove of cost recovery in whole or in part for implementation of treatment infrastructure for a contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard furthermore given the rapid pace at which these contaminants are being created andor discovered we may not be able to detect andor mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation in addition we believe these contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future which could significantly increase the cost of our operations 

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams groundwater aquifers and recycled water sources are held in the public trust and are not generally owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities or by entering into water purchase agreements these requirements which can change from time to time and vary by state or region may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water if we are unable to secure available or alternative sources of water our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 2009 cease and desist order the “2009 order” as amended by a july 2016 order the “2016 order” of the swrcb that requires our california subsidiary to significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on december 31 2021 the “2021 deadline” see item 3—legal proceedings—alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions which includes additional information regarding this matter we are 

table of contents 

also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act we cannot predict whether our california subsidiary will be able to secure alternative sources of water or if it will be able to meet the 2021 deadline or the diversion reduction and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order and the 2016 order failure by our california subsidiary to comply with the 2009 order and the 2016 order in whole or in part or the 2021 deadline may result in material additional costs or obligations including fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect upon us and our business results of operations and cash flows 

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions climate variability patterns or natural or other disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service interruptions due to severe weather climate variability patterns and natural or other events are possible across all our businesses these include among other things storms freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes landslides drought wildfires coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains pandemics including the covid19 pandemic and epidemics severe electrical storms sinkholes and solar flares weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our regulated businesses may not provide reimbursement to us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions rationing restrictions water conservation regulations and requirements to minimize water system leaks while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant puc determines they were reasonable and prudent we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will in fact be fully recovered moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise 

the issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability many climate variability predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities including us such as 

• increased frequency and duration of droughts 

• increased precipitation and flooding 

• increased frequency and severity of storms and other weather events 

• challenges associated with changes in temperature or increases in ocean levels 

• potential degradation of water quality 

• decreases in available water supply and changes in water usage patterns 

• increases in disruptions in service 

• increased costs to repair damaged facilities or 

• increased costs to reduce risks associated with the increasing frequency of natural events including to improve the resiliency and reliability of our water and wastewater treatment and conveyance facilities and systems 

because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity furthermore laws and regulations have been enacted that seek to reduce or limit ghg emissions and require additional reporting and monitoring and these regulations may become more pervasive or stringent in light of changing governmental agendas and priorities although the exact nature and timing of these changes is uncertain although some or all potential expenditures and costs associated with the impact of climate variability and related laws and regulations on our regulated businesses could be recovered through rates infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms there can be no assurance that state pucs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs in whole or in part 

table of contents 

the current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay also known as “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications our inability to mitigate or minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business 

there is typically a delay known as “regulatory lag” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices for example three of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently in addition 11 of our state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates furthermore in setting rates ten of our state pucs allow us to use future test years which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis other examples of such regulatory practices include expense mechanisms that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case application process without the mechanisms 

while these mechanisms have mitigated or reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states we continue to seek expansion of regulatory practices to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved them furthermore pucs may fail to adopt new surcharges and existing mechanisms may not continue in their current form or at all or we may be unable or become ineligible to continue to utilize certain of these mechanisms in the future although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected 

changes in laws and regulations can significantly and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions including without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax laws can materially affect our operations results of operations and cash flows certain of the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes of certain of the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others 

• making it more difficult for us to increase our rates and as a consequence to recover our costs or earn our expected rates of return 

• changing the determination of the costs or the amount of costs that would be considered recoverable in rate cases and other regulatory proceedings 

• restricting our ability to terminate our services to customers who owe us money for services previously provided or limiting our bill collection efforts 

• requiring us to provide water or wastewater services at reduced rates to certain customers 

• limiting or restricting our ability to acquire water or wastewater systems purchase or dispose of assets or issue longterm debt or equity or making it less costeffective for us to do so 

• negatively impacting among other things i tax rates or positions or the deductibility of expenses under federal or state tax laws ii the availability or amount of or our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of tax credits or tax abatement benefit iii the amount of taxes owed iv the timing of tax effects on rates or v the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 

• changing regulations that affect the benefits we expected to receive when we began offering services in a particular area 

table of contents 

• increasing the associated costs of or difficulty complying with environmental health safety consumer privacy water quality and water quality accountability laws and regulations to which our operations are subject 

• changing or placing additional limitations on change in control requirements relating to any concentration of ownership of our common stock 

• making it easier for governmental entities to convert our assets to public ownership via condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or for governmental agencies or private plaintiffs to assess liability against us for damages under these or similar processes 

• placing limitations prohibitions or other requirements with respect to the sharing of information and participation in transactions by or between a regulated subsidiary and us or our other affiliates including service company and any of our other subsidiaries 

• restricting or prohibiting our extraction of water from rivers streams reservoirs or aquifers and 

• revoking or altering the terms of a cpcn issued to us by a state puc or other governmental authority 

an example of an area in which laws and regulations are changing and increasing rapidly is with respect to data and consumer privacy security and protection we are becoming subject to an increasing number of data and consumer privacy security and protection laws and regulations administered by various federal state and local governments including for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 federal and state governments have also adopted or are proposing other limitations on or requirements regarding the collection distribution use security and storage of personally identifiable information in addition the federal trade commission and state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards on the collection use and dissemination of data moreover we expect that current laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security in the united states will continue to evolve and increase and we cannot determine the impact that compliance with such future laws regulations or standards will have on us or on our business any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with current or future federal state or local data or consumer privacy or security laws regulations policies guidance industry standards or legal obligations or any incident resulting in unauthorized access to or acquisition release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other data relating to our customers employees and others may result in private or governmental enforcement actions litigation fines and penalties or adverse perception or publicity about us and our businesses which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and could result in us incurring substantial costs these events could also result in significant diversions of resources distract management and divert the focus and attention of our security and technical personnel from other critical activities any of the foregoing consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs and liabilities 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks if collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated or inadequately treated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows certain of our wastewater systems have commercial and industrial customers that are subject to specific limitations on the type character and strength of the wastewater they are permitted to discharge into our systems the failure by these commercial and industrial customers to comply with their respective discharge requirements could in turn negatively impact our operations damage our facilities or cause us to exceed applicable discharge limitations and requirements liabilities resulting from such exceedance events could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a loss of one or more large industrial or commercial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our regulated businesses 

adverse economic conditions the covid19 pandemic or other factors may cause our customers particularly industrial and large commercial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by such a customer typically results in reduced water usage by that customer for example during 2020 the company experienced a decrease in net customer demand related mainly to industrial and commercial customers which the company believes to be attributable to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions or the current covid19 pandemic affecting these customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations tariffs in place with respect to our regulated businesses may not reimburse us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

table of contents 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment and to improve aging infrastructure in 2020 we invested 18 billion in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and may increase we expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt and equity we may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper longterm debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all if we are not able to obtain sufficient financing we may be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions property damage and increased capital expenditures and om costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have risks associated with aging infrastructure including water and sewer mains pumping stations and water and wastewater treatment facilities additionally we may have limited information regarding buried and newly acquired assets which could challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset management and maintenance practices assets that have aged beyond their expected useful lives may experience a higher rate of failure failure of aging infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and om costs and negatively impact our future om efficiency ratio in addition failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage and in safety environmental and public health impacts to the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not fully recovered in rates our results of operations liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues 

the volume of water we sell during the warmer months typically in the summer is generally greater than during other months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

three of our jurisdictions california illinois and new york have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to recover the revenues authorized in a general rate case regardless of sales volume revenue stability mechanisms are designed to recognize declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently in those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism our operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality 

contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions damage to our reputation and private litigation 

the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system or the water service that is provided to our customers may be subject to contamination including among other items contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate methyl tertiary butyl ether 14dioxane lead and other materials or chemical spills or other incidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks or other similar incidents in addition new categories of contaminants continue to emerge in the water industry if one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 limiting use of the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply if service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods we may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance customer rates tariffs or contract terms and any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies see item 3—legal proceedings for information on certain pending lawsuits related to interruptions of water service 

table of contents 

since we are engaged in the business of providing water service to our customers contamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts of these claims in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water or water supplies in addition insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses and are subject to deductibles and other limitations pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions 

our business and operations have a large direct and indirect customer base and as a result we are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of water service wastewater and related or ancillary services the quality of water provided and the amount timeliness accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services for example our new york subsidiary experienced increased customer and regulatory scrutiny related to an investigation by the new york state public service commission the “nyspsc” of the unintentional provision by our new york subsidiary of incorrect data to a taxing authority and the failure of a few employees of that subsidiary to properly disclose these issues in a rate case a settlement of this investigation was approved by the supreme court of the state of new york in september 2018 adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment arising out of these and other incidents may render legislatures and other governing bodies state pucs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative regulatory and economic outcomes as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our marketbased businesses as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

the properties of our regulated businesses segment include 75 dams the majority of which are earthen dams the failure of any of these dams could result in personal injury and property damage including without limitation downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs although in most cases the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future the inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries property and other damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems which involves risks including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers which may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business 

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 

the negotiation and execution of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in among other things 

• incurrence or assumption of debt contingent liabilities and environmental liabilities and obligations including liabilities that were unknown or undisclosed at the time of acquisition 

• failure to recover acquisition premiums 

• unanticipated capital expenditures 

• failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 

• the need to successfully integrate the acquired systems’ operations and water quality cybersecurity and infrastructure protection measures 

• recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges 

• fluctuations in quarterly results 

• unanticipated acquisitionrelated expenses 

• failure to realize anticipated benefits and synergies such as cost savings and revenue enhancements and 

• difficulties in integrating or assimilating personnel benefits services and systems 

some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business the systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated revenue return on equity or profitability or other perceived synergies and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our net income and profitability or adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions 

our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process a municipality other government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition 

for example in november 2018 monterey california ballot measure j which was added by a citizens group was certified as having been approved by a public vote requiring the mpwmd to conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the monterey system assets without an additional public vote the public vote led to the issuance by the mpwmd in november 2019 of a preliminary report finding among other things that the acquisition of the monterey system assets by the mpwmd would be economically feasible in november 2020 the mpwmd certified an feir with respect to a proposed acquisition and operation of this system by the mpwmd and our california subsidiary has filed a petition in court challenging this certification also five municipalities in the chicago illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our illinois subsidiary in january 2013 seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities this lawsuit remains pending and a valuation trial is scheduled for the second quarter of 2021 see item 1—business—regulated businesses—condemnation and eminent domain which includes additional information regarding these matters 

table of contents 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our regulated businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently in california lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property in some cases the puc has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits 

contesting an exercise of condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation eminent domain or other process may not be successful which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity 

we may be subject to physical and cyber attacks 

as operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical and cyber attacks from internal or external sources our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes our operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties further third parties including vendors suppliers and contractors who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access while we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational and technology systems those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities we cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack 

if despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred our operations could be disrupted property damaged and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen we could experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss we could suffer a loss of management time attention and resources from our regular business operations and we may be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties these types of events either impacting our facilities or the industry in general could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs 

in addition in the ordinary course of business we collect and retain sensitive information including personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in many cases we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks any theft loss or fraudulent use of customer employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation liability and costs as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators among others 

we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates 

we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations as well as the operations of our marketbased businesses our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make generally our insurance policies cover property damage worker’s compensation employer’s liability general liability cybersecurity terrorism risks and automobile liability each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims as a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

table of contents 

although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles 

we rely on technology to facilitate the management of our business as well as our customer and supplier relationships and a failure or disruption of implemented technology could materially and adversely affect our business 

technology is an integral part of our business and operations and any failure or disruption of the technology or related systems we implement could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business effectively and efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations we use technology systems to among other things bill customers process orders provide customer service manage certain plant operations and construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor our plants and facilities and manage human resources supply chain inventory and accounts receivable collections as a specific example we depend on water meters to record and communicate the amount of water our customers use and in recent years we have experienced greater than expected performance failures with certain water meters used in the regulated businesses when these occur we work with meter manufacturers to determine and address the cause of such failures while these and other failures that we have experienced have not to date had a material adverse effect on our operations there can be no assurance that efforts to address performance failures or other issues we may experience with water meters will be successful and that these or future failures of water meters or other issues will not have a material adverse effect on us 

although we do not believe that the technology we have implemented or may in the future implement is at a materially greater risk of failure than that used by other similar organizations our technology and operations that use or rely on technology remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from among other things failure or interruption of the technology or its related systems loss or failure of power internet telecommunications or data network systems and operator error or improper operation by the negligent or improper supervision of or the intentional acts of employees contractors and other third parties any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

an inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a significant part of our longterm strategic focus on safety operational excellence om expense efficiency water quality asset and capital management and the customer experience includes implementing new technologies for among other things customer service and support environmental compliance water metering water quality and source monitoring cybersecurity business development and growth data analysis employee development and training and other initiatives for example we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing deploying and maintaining customerfacing technologies applications to support field service and customer service operations water source sensor and evaluation technologies and data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies where appropriate we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructure and systems there can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing developing deploying integrating or maintaining these new technologies because these efforts can be longterm in nature these new technologies may be more costly or timeconsuming than expected to design develop integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion while we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our regulated businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in every instance or at all and our inability to do so may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended om expense efficiencies or other key performance results and ultimately could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems or implement new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks or the implementation of new systems may require substantial amounts of management’s time and financial resources to complete and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors including employees’ ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system we continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions and have installed new and upgraded existing technology systems any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting we may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls business and operations we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated and any such impacts could harm our business individually or collectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows

our business has inherently dangerous work sites if we fail to maintain safe work sites we may experience workforce or customer injuries or loss of life and be exposed to financial losses including penalties and other liabilities 

safety is a core value and a strategy at american water our safety performance and progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries is critical to our reputation we maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers contractors vendors and the public eliminating all hazards all of the time is extremely challenging but through strict adherence to our health and safety standards and empowering employees to stop work if deemed “unsafe” we believe we can achieve an injuryfree workplace 

at our business sites including construction and maintenance sites our employees contractors and others are often in close proximity to large mechanical operating equipment moving vehicles pressurized water electric and gas utility lines below grade trenches and vaults electrical and pneumatic hazards fall from height hazards suspended loads hazardous chemicals and other regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement important safety procedures and practices above governmental regulatory requirements as an essential business that must continue to provide water and wastewater services during the current covid19 pandemic we are focused on the care and safety of our employees contractors vendors customers and others who work at or visit our worksites if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others or we fail to implement procedures our employees contractors and others may experience illness or minor serious or fatal injuries unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our operations can involve the delivery handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly delivered handled stored or disposed of could result in serious injury death environmental damage or property damage and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities we are also subject to various environmental transportation and occupational health and safety regulations although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health and safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization including construction sites and operating facilities the failure to comply with these regulations or procedures could subject us to liability 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations and the ability to serve our customers 

as of december 31 2020 approximately 45 of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 72 collective bargaining agreements in place with 14 different unions representing our unionized employees these collective bargaining agreements 17 of which will expire during 2021 are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation we may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts or enter into new agreements on terms that are acceptable to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may disrupt our operations negatively impact the ability to serve our customers and result in higher labor costs which could adversely affect our reputation financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

financial economic and marketrelated risks 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2020 our aggregate longterm and shortterm debt balance including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 109 billion and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures 

• exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates 

• limiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations 

• impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity 

• requiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt thereby reducing funds available for future operations dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures 

table of contents 

• limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions and 

• placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt 

in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility or issue a combination of new shortterm and longterm debt securities andor equity we continue to assess our short and longterm liquidity needs in light of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the financial and capital markets especially with respect to the market for corporate commercial paper which experienced volatility and shortages of liquidity in march 2020 in response to these events in march 2020 we entered into a 750 million 364day term loan facility and immediately executed a 500 million draw thereunder to support our shortterm liquidity by retaining that amount in cash no further borrowings may be made under the term loan facility during 2020 we utilized other existing sources of liquidity such as our current cash balances cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility as necessary or desirable to meet our shortterm liquidity requirements we believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future however as the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on the economy the financial and capital markets and our operations evolve we will continue to assess our liquidity needs in the event of a sustained market deterioration we may need to obtain additional sources of liquidity which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions 

moreover additional borrowings may be required to repay or refinance outstanding indebtedness other than debt with respect to the term loan facility debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2021 2022 and 2023 will be 329 million 14 million and 356 million respectively we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms if at all to repay or refinance this debt moreover as new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to repay or refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

we have in the past entered into and in the future may enter into financial derivative instruments including without limitation interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk however these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance which will be affected by the financial business economic competitive legislative including tax initiatives and reforms and other similar legislation or regulation regulatory and other risk factors described in this section many of which are beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected materially and adversely 

our inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations during 2020 we generally relied primarily on a 225 billion revolving credit facility a 210 billion commercial paper program our 750 million 364day term loan facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs the revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in march 2025 and the 364day term loan facility will expire in march 2021 historically we have regularly used our commercial paper program rather than the revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally could obtain in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 786 million of commercial paper outstanding 76 million in outstanding letters of credit and 500 million outstanding under the 364day term loan facility there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to access this commercial paper program or revolving credit facility when as and if desired or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable or any cost 

under the terms of the revolving credit facility and the 364day term loan facility our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70 of our consolidated capitalization as determined under the terms of the those facilities if our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that causes us to exceed this limit lenders under those facilities would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit under the revolving credit facility and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the revolving credit facility andor the term loan facility immediately due and payable to avoid such a default a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility the term loan facility and our 

table of contents 

other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties including events beyond our control for example events that could cause a reduction in equity include without limitation a significant writedown of our goodwill even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete 

disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all while the lending banks that participate in the revolving credit facility have to date honored their commitments under those facilities disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments in such a case we may not be able to access the commercial paper or debt or capital markets or other sources of potential liquidity in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under our revolving credit facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity short or longterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of economic legislative political or other uncertainty including as a result of the current covid19 pandemic changes in us tax and other laws reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital debt or credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include delaying or deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures finally there is no assurance that we will be able to access the equity markets to obtain capital or financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us 

any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the debt or equity capital markets or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

parent company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds 

parent company is a holding company and as such it has no substantive operations of its own substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries parent company’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company prior to paying dividends to parent company our regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and our covenants and other agreements our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company a failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations 

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2020 we had us federal and state nol carryforwards of approximately 366 million and 357 million respectively and management believes it is more likely than not that these nol carryforwards will be recovered in the future with the enactment in december 2017 of the tcja we analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 on our deferred tax assets and liabilities including our nol carryforwards and as a result remeasured those nol carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the tcja based on this tax rate change 

our federal nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029 and our state nol carryforwards began to expire in 2020 and will continue to expire through 2040 we expect to fully utilize our federal nol balance before it expires and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our state nol carryforwards and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income 

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover adoption of related interpretations with respect to the tcja and other changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of our nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include 15 billion of goodwill at december 31 2020 the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and our acquisition of pivotal in 2018 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business these market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or other circumstances for example in the third quarter of 2018 prior to our sale of our former keystone clearwater solutions “keystone” operations we strategically narrowed the scope of that business and as a result we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of 57 million 

a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization the effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators 

market volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations and volatility which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates as the covid19 pandemic continued throughout 2020 the stock market would often experience significant daytoday fluctuations in market prices we are currently unable to predict the effect if any of the covid19 pandemic or other events on the valuation of our pension assets and liabilities a decline in the market value of our pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as of the measurement date can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates interest rates have experienced volatility and are subject to potential further adjustments based on the actions of the us federal reserve and others if interest rates are lower at the measurement date our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

additional risks related to our marketbased businesses 

parent company provides performance guarantees with respect to certain of the obligations of our marketbased businesses including financial guarantees or deposits which may adversely affect parent company if the guarantees are successfully enforced 

under the terms of certain agreements under which our marketbased businesses primarily msg provide water and wastewater services to municipalities other governmental entities and other customers parent company provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased businesses including financial guarantees or deposits in the event our marketbased businesses fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against parent company or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected at december 31 2020 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 62 billion related to msg’s contracts and this amount is likely to increase if the number of bases served by msg increases the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 

table of contents 

msg’s operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the us government 

msg enters into contracts with the us government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems which contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to either an annual economic price adjustment or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter annual economic price adjustment is an inflation indexbased contract price increase mechanism price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

moreover entering into contracts with the us government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations we are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which are complex and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended or debarred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the us government or our existing contracts could be terminated which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

general risk factors 

new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the sec the financial accounting standards board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies these changes are beyond our control can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which could also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure 

our internal controls accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap taxation requirements federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us we have also implemented corporate governance internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” and relevant sec rules as well as other applicable regulations such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and board of directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws rules and regulations management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls while we believe these controls policies practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting the consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition the inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also harm our reputation increase financing costs or adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers licensed operators water quality and other operating and craft personnel and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted

 item 3 legal proceedings 

alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

compliance with swrcb orders to reduce carmel river diversions 

under the 2009 order californiaamerican water company the company’s california subsidiary “cal am” is required among other things to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule see item 1—business—regulated businesses—water supply and wastewater services and item 1a—risk factors the 2009 order responded to claims that cal am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the carmel river as required by a 1995 order of the swrcb in july 2016 at the request of cal am and several monterey county government agencies the swrcb issued the 2016 order approving the 2021 deadline 

the 2009 order includes a condition prohibiting cal am from diverting water from the carmel river for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use in 2011 the california public utilities commission the “cpuc” issued a decision directing modifications in cal am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 order and directing cal am to seek written guidance from the swrcb with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition in 2012 the deputy director of the swrcb sent a letter to cal am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses in march 2018 the mpwmd adopted a resolution directing cal am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the swrcb’s written interpretation in may 2018 cal am notified the mpwmd and the swrcb that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 order in an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention cal am has met with the mpwmd and the swrcb several times the swrcb agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter which would be subject to a public comment period any failure to follow the mpwmd’s resolution or the swrcb’s written interpretation despite these conflicting interpretations could potentially result in fines penalties and other actions against cal am 

the 2016 order provides that if the cpuc authorizes cal am to acquire more than 1000 acrefeet per year of water from a source other than the water supply project proponents of the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the swrcb for consideration see monterey peninsula water supply project below in may 2018 certain parties to the water supply project proceeding submitted a petition to the swrcb to add parallel milestones to the 2009 order for 2019 2020 and 2021 based on the proposed expansion of the pure water monterey project another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the monterey peninsula petitioners claim that compliance with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of cal am’s unauthorized diversions from the carmel river by 2021 a preliminary report on feasibility concluded that the expanded pure water monterey project could provide an additional 2250 acrefeet of water per year cal am believes that i the petition is premature ii the expanded pure water monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and even if construction is successfully completed would provide an insufficient quantity of water to allow full compliance with the 2009 order and iii the imposition of parallel milestones would distract from completion of the water supply project in december 2019 the swrcb dismissed the petition without prejudice 

the 2016 order imposes yearly milestones related to construction of the water supply project’s desalination plant facilities if any milestone is missed the swrcb may impose reductions of up to 1000 acrefeet per year in the amount of water cal am is able to divert from the carmel river if a milestone is missed for reasons that are beyond cal am’s control the swrcb may waive the diversion reduction on october 21 2020 cal am reported to the swrcb that due to circumstances beyond its control it will be unable to meet the 2020 milestones requiring intake well drilling and plant construction due to i delays by the california coastal commission the “coastal commission” in considering cal am’s application for a permit for the desalination facility’s intake wells and ii a stay issued by the monterey superior court on physical construction of the desalination plant in pending litigation over the plant’s construction permit nevertheless cal am reported that even with a 1000 acrefoot reduction in carmel river water supplies it believed that customer demand could be met without additional rationing in the 20202021 water year on november 17 2020 the swrcb provided its view to cal am that the milestone reductions were imposed to ensure a staggered approach to ending unauthorized diversions and that regardless of fault a 1000 acrefoot reduction was an appropriate and intended consequence of missing the milestone 

cal am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for the water supply project however based on the matters discussed above and below in item 3—monterey peninsula water supply project there can be no assurance that the water supply project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis if ever due to the delay in the approval schedule cal am currently does not believe that it will be able to fully comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order and the 2016 order including the 2021 deadline while the company cannot currently predict the likelihood or result of any adverse outcome associated with these matters further attempts to comply with the 2009 order and the 2016 order or the 2021 deadline may result in material additional costs and obligations to cal am including fines and penalties against cal am in the event of noncompliance with the 2009 order or the 2016 order 

monterey peninsula water supply project 

cpuc final approval of water supply project 

cal am’s ability to move forward on the water supply project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc and other government agencies obtaining necessary permits and intervention from other parties in september 2016 the cpuc unanimously approved a final decision to authorize cal am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the gwr project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to the incurred 50 million in associated costs plus afudc subject to meeting certain criteria 

in september 2018 the cpuc unanimously approved another final decision finding that i the water supply project meets the cpuc’s requirements for a cpcn ii the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed and iii an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects the cpuc’s 2018 decision concludes that the water supply project is the best project to address estimated future water demands in monterey and in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision adopts cal am’s cost estimates for the water supply project which amounted to an aggregate of 279 million plus afudc at a rate representative of cal am’s actual financing costs the 2018 final decision specifies the procedures for recovery of all of cal am’s prudently incurred costs associated with the water supply project upon its completion subject to the frameworks included in the final decision related to cost caps om costs financing ratemaking and contingency matters the reasonableness of the water supply project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by cal am after it becomes operational cal am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the water supply project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program a reimbursement agreement for cpuc costs associated with that program and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the water supply project in service cal am has incurred 154 million in aggregate costs as of december 31 2020 related to the water supply project which includes 36 million in afudc while cal am believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 order and the 2016 order as well as the cpuc’s 2016 and 2018 final decisions cal am cannot currently predict its ability to recover all of its costs and expenses associated with the water supply project and there can be no assurance that cal am will be able to recover all of such costs and expenses in excess of the 50 million in construction costs previously approved by the cpuc in its 2016 final decision see note 17—commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

on july 2 2019 cal am notified the mpwmd and monterey one water collectively the “agencies” that an event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement for the gwr project because the agencies failed to deliver to cal am by july 1 2019 advanced treated recycled water produced by the gwr project under the water purchase agreement upon the occurrence of this event of default cal am had the right to terminate the water purchase agreement immediately cal am has elected not to exercise its right to terminate the water purchase agreement at this time but in its notification to the agencies cal am expressly reserved its right to terminate the water purchase agreement until such time as the agencies commence their required delivery of water from the gwr project on july 16 2019 the mpwmd and monterey one water responded to cal am’s event of default notice and estimated that water delivery would begin by midoctober 2019 on december 12 2019 cal am sent a letter to the agencies requesting a status update with respect to the event of default on january 2 2020 cal am notified the agencies that a second event of default occurred under the water purchase agreement because the agencies failed to achieve the performance start date the date upon which the mpwmd’s performance obligations under the water purchase agreement were to commence by january 1 2020 under the water purchase agreement upon the occurrence of this event of default cal am had the right to terminate the water purchase agreement immediately cal am has elected not to exercise its right to terminate the water purchase agreement at this time but in its notification to the agencies cal am expressly reserved its right to terminate the water purchase agreement until such time as the performance start date has occurred on july 30 2020 the agencies advised cal am that the performance start date under the water purchase agreement for the gwr project is september 1 2020 after june 30 2021 cal am will determine the amount of advanced treated recycled water produced by the gwr project and delivered to cal am during the first fiscal year of the water purchase agreement to determine the agencies’ compliance with their performance obligations thereunder 

on april 17 2019 water ratepayers association of the monterey peninsula “wramp” a citizens’ advocacy group filed an amended complaint in monterey county superior court asserting a “qui tam” claim under the california false claims act on behalf of itself and the state of california against cal am and certain environmental consultants who worked on the cpuc’s environmental analysis of the mpwsp the state attorney general declined to proceed with this action after it was originally filed in 2016 on july 10 2019 defendants filed a joint demurrer challenging the legal sufficiency of the allegations of the amended complaint at an august 27 2019 hearing on the demurrer the court dismissed the petition without leave to amend on october 17 2019 wramp filed motions seeking clarification and a reconsideration of the court’s ruling a hearing on these motions was set for december 3 2019 but on november 26 2019 wramp abandoned its motions and instead filed an appeal of the court’s dismissal on november 17 2020 wramp dismissed its appeal in exchange for a waiver of costs 

coastal development permit application 

in june 2018 cal am submitted a coastal development permit application to the city of marina the “city” for those project components of the water supply project located within the city’s coastal zone members of the city’s planning commission as well as city councilpersons have publicly expressed opposition to the water supply project in may 2019 the city issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the planning commission of cal am’s coastal development permit application thereafter cal am appealed this decision to the coastal commission as permitted under the city’s code and the california coastal act at the same time cal am submitted an application to the coastal commission for a coastal development permit for those project components located within the coastal commission’s original jurisdiction in october 2019 staff of the coastal commission issued a report recommending a denial of cal am’s application for a coastal development permit with respect to the water supply project largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general manager of the mpwmd that contradicted findings made by the cpuc in its final decision approving the water supply project in november 2019 discussions between staffs of the coastal commission and the cpuc took place regarding the coastal commission staff recommendation at which time the cpuc raised questions about the coastal commission staff’s findings on water supply and demand groundwater impacts and the viability of a project that the coastal commission staff believes may be a possible alternative to the water supply project 

on august 25 2020 the staff of the coastal commission released a report again recommending denial of cal am’s application for a coastal development permit although the report concluded that the water supply project would have a negligible impact on groundwater resources the report also concluded it would impact other coastal resources such as environmentally sensitive habitat areas and wetlands and that the coastal commission staff believes that a feasible alternative project exists that would avoid those impacts the staff’s report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities of concern on september 16 2020 cal am withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the coastal commission staff’s environmental justice concerns the withdrawal of the original jurisdiction application did not impact cal am’s appeal of the city’s denial which remains pending before the coastal commission cal am refiled the original jurisdiction application on november 6 2020 on december 3 2020 the coastal commission sent to cal am a notice of incomplete application identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete cal am is preparing a response to the coastal commission’s notice 

desalination plant development permit 

the proposed desalination plant for the water supply project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of monterey county california on a site owned by cemex inc “cemex” and requires a combined development permit from the county of monterey prior to commencement of construction on april 24 2019 the county’s planning commission voted to approve the permit in july 2019 the board of supervisors heard appeals filed by mcwd and a public advocacy group at which time it denied the appeals and approved the permit in august 2019 mcwd filed a petition in monterey county superior court challenging monterey county’s approval of cal am’s combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin monterey county and cal am from commencing construction of the desalination plant in october 2019 after a hearing the court denied without prejudice mcwd’s motion for a preliminary injunction but issued a stay of the county’s approval of the combined development permit precluding commencement of physical construction of the desalination plant but allowing cal am to continue to obtain permits needed for the desalination plant’s construction on january 21 2021 the court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part mcwd’s petition the court found that the county of monterey did not completely comply with all of the requirements necessary to approve the combined development permit and set aside its approval so that the county could come into compliance the court denied all of mcwd’s other claims the court also lifted its stay on physical construction at the plant site 

proposed zoning changes at cemex site for slant wells 

in august 2018 the city circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance and placed the matter for consideration on the planning commission’s agenda for its september 2018 meeting the proposed amendments would change zoning at the cemex site to open space and restrict future uses including with respect to cal am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the water supply project any change to the citys local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the coastal commission cal am cemex and the coastal commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments at its november 2018 meeting the planning commission adopted a resolution recommending that the marina city council consider approving the amendments 

in december 2018 the marina city council considered the proposed amendments cal am cemex and the coastal commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes but the city council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final which occurred at the city’s december 2018 meeting the changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the coastal commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained 

test slant well permitting 

a preliminary step to building the water supply project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under monterey bay in november 2014 the coastal commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well enabling cal am to construct and operate the test slant well because cal am may use the test slant well as one of the slant wells for the water supply project cal am sought and obtained from the coastal commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until february 28 2022 a required lease obtained from the california state lands commission as amended will expire on december 16 2022 effective february 28 2018 test slant well pumping ceased except for minimal maintenance pumping activities in accordance with cal am’s coastal development permits 

water supply project land acquisition and slant well site use 

in july 2017 the coastal commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned by cemex on which intake wells for the water supply project will be located to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a nonprofit or governmental entity the consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves cal am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record a permanent easement granted by cemex to cal am was recorded in june 2018 to allow cal am access to the property and to construct operate and maintain the water supply project intake wells on november 26 2019 the city notified cemex that based on this permanent easement and cal am’s proposed use of the site for the intake wells cemex has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement to which cal am was not a party the city states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from cemex and cal am ordering that cal am’s extraction is limited to 500 acrefeet per year of groundwater that cal am cannot export extracted water out of the basin and that the permanent easement granted by cemex to cal am is void the city has requested a meeting with cemex as part of a mandatory dispute resolution process under the annexation agreement prior to filing a lawsuit cemex has denied the city’s claims and requested indemnification from cal am under the terms of the permanent easement cal am and cemex believe that there is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on cal am’s right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the site for desalination and use by cal am’s customers 

on may 8 2020 the city filed a lawsuit which it amended on june 29 2020 and october 15 2020 in monterey county superior court naming cal am and cemex as defendants and mcwra and mcwd as real parties in interest the lawsuit alleges a claim for breach of contract against cemex and seeks declaratory relief to void the permanent easement and prohibiting extraction of water by cal am’s slant wells at the cemex site in excess of 500 acrefeet per year and the export of such water outside the groundwater basin on november 17 2020 cal am cemex and mcwra filed demurrers which were overruled by the court at a hearing held on february 9 2021 

on august 4 2020 mcwd filed a crosscomplaint in the may 8 2020 lawsuit against cal am cemex and mcwra alleging claims for specific performance of certain provisions of the 1996 annexation agreement related to the property owned by cemex on which intake wells for the water supply project will be located water rights nuisance unreasonable water use and declaratory relief on september 9 2020 cal am filed a demurrer and motion to strike challenging the claims asserted by mcwd on october 14 2020 the court sustained with leave to amend the demurrers as to the claims for specific performance enjoinment of invasion of water rights nuisance and unreasonable water use and the court overruled the demurrers as to the claim for declaratory relief mcwd filed a first amended complaint on november 13 2020 on december 7 2020 cal am cemex and mcwra filed demurrers to the amended claims on february 23 2021 the court sustained without leave to amend the demurrer to mcwd’s nuisance claim and overruled the remainder of the demurrers 

under california’s sustainable groundwater management act “sgma” enacted in 2015 groundwater basins designated by the state as critically overdrafted must be managed by a groundwater sustainability agency “gsa” by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan “gsp” designed to achieve sustainability by 2040 under the sgma gsas have broad powers to achieve sustainability including but not limited to regulating groundwater extraction by imposing fees on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating limiting or suspending extractions from wells the 400acre cemex site overlies a small portion of the 180400 subbasin of the salinas valley groundwater basin the 84000acre 180400 subbasin has been designated by the state as critically overdrafted mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin 

in late 2016 the salinas valley basin groundwater sustainability agency the “svbgsa” was formed as a joint powers authority to become the gsa for the salinas valley groundwater basin and prepare a gsp in april 2018 the city filed a notice to become the gsa for the cemex site creating an overlap with the svbgsa’s filing for the 180400 subbasin in 2016 the svbgsa commenced preparation of a gsp covering the entire 180400 subbasin including the cemex site but in august 2019 the city filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own gsp for the cemex site with the intent to severely limit or prohibit groundwater pumping at that site the state department of water resources “sdwr” has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved it will not accept the gsp from either agency placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management in december 2019 the county of monterey filed its own notice to become the exclusive gsa at the cemex site in order to resolve the overlap which is permitted under sgma sdwr accepted the county’s filing on december 18 2019 and now lists the county as the exclusive gsa for the site 

on december 30 2019 the city filed a lawsuit in monterey county superior court challenging the county’s filing and sdwr’s acceptance of the filing as the exclusive gsa for the cemex site the city has named the county and its board of supervisors the county gsa and sdwr and its director as defendants and the svbgsa and its board of directors as real parties the city seeks to invalidate the county’s filing as well as injunctive relief to preserve the city’s status as a gsa for the site to protect its interest in the matter cal am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit which was granted a hearing has been scheduled for may 17 2021 

on september 14 2020 cal am filed a separate but related complaint in monterey county superior court challenging the validity of actions taken by the city and its gsa in adopting a groundwater sustainability plan for the cemex site and the validity of the provisions of such plan due to the overlap of issues in the city’s lawsuit with those in the validation action the parties stipulated to a stay of the validation action pending determination of the claims in the city’s action on december 21 2020 the court stayed the validation action

liquidity and capital resources 

the company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments acquisitions operations commitments debt maturities interest and dividends the company’s business is capital intensive with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations when necessary the company also obtains funds from external sources primarily in the debt markets and through shortterm commercial paper borrowings the company may also access the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements as needed the company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the utility and water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit the company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets 

if these business market financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the company is no longer able to access the capital markets on reasonable terms awcc has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in march 2025 with aggregate bank commitments of 225 billion the facility is used principally to fulfill the company’s shortterm liquidity needs by supporting awcc’s 210 billion commercial paper program and to provide a sublimit of up to 150 million for letters of credit subject to satisfying certain conditions the credit agreement permits awcc to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to 500 million 

in order to meet shortterm liquidity needs awcc issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2020 awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility with 139 billion available to fulfill its shortterm liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit the company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the company’s shortterm requirements the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets however there can no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to awcc under the revolving credit facility or that awcc will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all see credit facilities and shortterm debt below for additional information 

to ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on debt and capital markets on march 20 2020 awcc entered into a term loan credit agreement by and among parent company awcc and the lenders party thereto which provided for the term loan facility of up to 750 million on march 20 2020 awcc borrowed 500 million under the term loan facility the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes of awcc and american water and to provide additional liquidity the term loan facility allowed for a single additional borrowing of up to 250 million which expired unused on june 19 2020 the term loan facility commitments terminate on march 19 2021 as of december 31 2020 500 million of principal was outstanding under the term loan facility

cash flows provided by operating activities 

cash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the warmer months the company’s future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by among other things the company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner economic utility regulation inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs maintenance costs customer growth declining customer usage of water employeerelated costs including pension funding weather and seasonality taxes and overall economic conditions 

cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund the majority of the company’s capital investments the company expects to seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of its capital investment if any and fund its dividend payments as needed operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the company’s rate regulated environments changes in the marketbased businesses changes in the economy interest rates the timing of tax payments and the company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner among other items the company can provide no assurance that its customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future the company’s current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the use of shortterm debt as a funding source primarily to meet scheduled maturities of longterm debt fund acquisitions and construction projects as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business the company addresses cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms

the company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of 37 million in 2021 in addition the company estimates that contributions will amount to 37 million 35 million 33 million and 30 million in 2022 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns among other factors

one of the principal market risks to which the company is exposed is changes in interest rates in order to manage the exposure the company follows risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps the company reduces exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities the company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments the derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations the company minimizes the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by only dealing with leading creditworthy financial institutions having longterm credit ratings of “a” or better 

on april 8 2020 the company terminated four treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 400 million realizing a net loss of 6 million to be amortized through interest net over a tenyear period in accordance with the terms of the new debt issued on april 14 2020 no ineffectiveness was recognized on hedging instruments for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019

the outstanding senior notes issued by awcc the wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company have been issued under two indentures each by and between awcc and wells fargo bank national association as trustee providing for the rights and obligations of the parties thereto and the holders of the notes issued thereunder the senior notes also have been issued with the benefit of a support agreement as amended between parent company and awcc which serves as the functional equivalent of a full and unconditional guarantee by parent company of awcc’s payment obligations under the senior notes no other subsidiary of parent company provides guarantees for any of the outstanding senior notes if awcc is unable to make timely payment of any interest principal or premium if any on such senior notes parent company will provide to awcc at its request or the request of any holder of such senior notes funds to make such payment in full if awcc fails or refuses to take timely action to enforce certain rights under the support agreement or if awcc defaults in the timely payment of any amounts owed to any holder of such senior notes when due the support agreement provides that the holder may proceed directly against parent company to enforce such rights or to obtain payment of the defaulted amounts owed to that holder 

as a wholly owned finance subsidiary of parent company awcc has no significant assets other than obligations of parent company and certain of its subsidiaries in its regulated businesses segment to repay certain intercompany loans made to them by awcc awcc’s ability to make payments of amounts owed to holders of the senior notes will be dependent upon awcc’s receipt of sufficient payments of amounts owed pursuant to the terms of such intercompany loans and from its ability to issue indebtedness or otherwise obtain loans in the future the proceeds of which would be used to fund the repayment of the senior notes 

because parent company is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiaries other than awcc parent company’s ability to fulfill its obligations under the support agreement will be dependent upon its receipt of sufficient cash dividends or distributions from its operating subsidiaries see note 10—shareholders’ equity—dividends and distributions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the limitations on parent company and its subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions furthermore parent company’s operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and other than awcc have no obligation to make any payments on the senior notes or to make available or provide any funds for such payment other than through their repayment obligations under intercompany loans if any with awcc based on the foregoing parent company’s obligations under the support agreement will be effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities including trade payables lease commitments and moneys borrowed or other indebtedness incurred or issued by parent company’s subsidiaries other than awcc

interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the libor rate or applicable market replacement rate or base rate in accordance with moody investors service’s and standard  poor’s financial services’ then applicable credit rating on awcc’s senior unsecured noncredit enhanced debt the facility is used principally to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 150 million in letters of credit indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and awcc which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by parent company of awcc’s payment obligations under the credit facility

capital structure 

presented in the table below is the percentage of the company’s capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of december 31 



the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in longterm debt and the 500 million borrowed under the term loan facility during 2020 which is scheduled to terminate on march 19 2021 

debt covenants

covenants in certain longterm notes the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility require the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization as defined in the relevant documents of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2020 the company’s ratio was 063 to 100 and therefore the company was in compliance with the covenants 

security ratings 

presented in the table below are longterm and shortterm credit ratings and rating outlooks as of february 24 2021 as issued by the following rating agencies 



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans the company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings none of the company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility 

as part of its normal course of business the company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if the company is downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that the company must provide collateral to secure its obligations the company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets may be directly affected by the company’s securities ratings the company primarily accesses the debt capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however the company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds to lower the overall cost of debt

application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process the company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities such judgments include but are not limited to assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions pension and postretirement benefits depreciation rates and taxes due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a nonregulated entity to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates conversely the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where the company conducts business the company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments recent rate orders including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pending or potential legislation if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement the company’s consolidated statements of operations and financial position could be materially affected in addition if the company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria the company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the company’s consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the company’s regulatory asset balance was 11 billion and 11 billion respectively and its regulatory liability balance was 18 billion and 18 billion respectively see note 4—regulatory matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

accounting for income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and the utilization of nol carryforwards 

in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance the company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not morelikelythannot that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits no benefit is recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

the company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets the company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements the company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

under gaap specifically accounting standards codification topic 740 income taxes “asc 740” the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted asc 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled thus at the date of enactment of the tcja the company’s deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new tax rate for the company’s regulated entities the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to refund to customers for the company’s unregulated operations the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a noncash remeasurement adjustment to earnings 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the regulated businesses as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2020 and 2019 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance however the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 15—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

the company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations see note 16—employee benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

• discount rate—the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future the objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of highquality debt instruments would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due 

• expected return on plan assets “eroa”—management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance but primarily based upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the longterm returns on those asset classes these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs the company records currently 

• rate of compensation increase—management projects employees’ pay increases which are used to project employees’ pension benefits at retirement 

• health care cost trend rate—management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care 

• mortality— management adopted the society of actuaries pri2012 mortality base table the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new mp2020 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality rates downward due to increased longevity in each year after 2012 

the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices the company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 274 344 and 438 at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 256 336 and 432 at december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

in selecting an eroa the company considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 650 for 2020 620 for 2019 and 595 for 2018 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 368 for 2020 356 for 2019 and 477 for 2018 

presented in the table below are the allocations of the pension plan assets by asset category 



postretirement medical bargaining plan changes 

on july 31 2018 a fiveyear national benefits agreement was ratified covering as of july 31 2018 approximately 3200 of the company’s unionrepresented employees most of the benefits under this new agreement became effective on january 1 2019 and include among other things unionrepresented employees’ participation in the company’s cashbased annual performance plan additional medical plan options and changes to certain retiree medical benefits which required the company to remeasure its other postretirement benefit plan obligation during the third quarter of 2018 

for those eligible union retirees and dependents over age 65 the current supplemental retiree medical plan will be replaced with a health reimbursement arrangement “hra” similar to the cap currently in place for nonunion retirees the company is providing a subsidy allowing the post65 retirees to purchase a medicare supplemental plan on a private exchange network the pre65 coverage plan was also amended to provide a cap on future employer costs designed to limit the employer costs to 2018 levels for pre65 union members retiring early in 20192021 a supplemental benefit will be provided to alleviate the effect of the cap 

on august 31 2018 the postretirement medical benefit plan was remeasured to reflect this plan change the plan change resulted in a 175 million reduction in future benefits payable to plan participants and in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement date resulted in a 227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december 31 2020 the remaining amortization period of the impact of the plan amendment is 79 years as a result of the remeasurement and change in funded status the company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability plan assets in excess of those securities designed to match the longterm liabilities are invested in shorter duration fixed income securities and equities 

presented in the table below are the allocations of the other postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category 



a includes the american water postretirement medical benefits bargaining plan the new york water service corporation postretirement medical benefits bargaining plan the american water postretirement medical benefits nonbargaining plan and the american water life insurance trust 

the investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds commingled funds and limited partnerships the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase the company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates the company’s rate of compensation increase was 351 for 2020 297 for 2019 and 300 for 2018 

in selecting health care cost trend rates the company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs as of january 1 2020 the company’s health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 650 in 2020 gradually declining to 500 in 2026 and thereafter as of december 31 2020 the company projects that medical inflation will be 625 in 2021 gradually declining to 500 in 2026 and thereafter 

the company will use a discount rate and eroa of 274 and 650 respectively for estimating its 2021 pension costs additionally the company will use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 256 and 368 respectively for estimating its 2021 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase the company’s pension expense the company’s 2020 pension and postretirement benefit credit was 14 million and the 2019 pension and postretirement benefit cost was 17 million the company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of 37 million in 2021 and 37 million 35 million 33 million and 30 million in 2022 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the company’s regulated businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers these contracts contain a single performance obligation the delivery of water or wastewater services as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and therefore is not distinct revenues are recognized over time as services are provided there are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill to the end of the accounting period the amounts that the company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer 

increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue in addition changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation unbilled revenue for the company’s regulated utilities as of december 31 2020 and 2019 was 150 million and 142 million respectively 

the company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process 

revenue from the company’s homeowner services group is generated through various protection programs in which the company provides fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines interior electric and gas lines heating and cooling systems water heaters power surge protection and other related services most of the contracts have a oneyear term and each service is a separate performance obligation satisfied over time as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service customers are obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a onetime annual fee with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services advances from customers are deferred until the performance obligation is satisfied 

the company also has longterm fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the us government on various military installations and facilities owned by municipal customers billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the company additionally these contracts allow the company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract whereby standalone fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement the company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined unbilled revenue for the marketbased businesses as of december 31 2020 and 2019 was 56 million and 30 million respectively 

accounting for contingencies 

the company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated the determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter which may include an analysis of different scenarios liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible management considers many factors which include but are not limited to the nature of the litigation claim or assessment review of applicable law opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors and the experience gained from similar cases or situations the company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred the company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined either as a single amount or within a reasonable range 

actual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements see note 17—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingencies 

new accounting standards 

see note 2—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting standards 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates the company is exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates the company also has the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with the company’s shortterm borrowings would result in a 6 million increase in shortterm interest expense 

the company’s risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of the company’s common stock may experience fluctuations which may be unrelated to its operating performance in particular the company’s stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for the company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its common stock or other equity securities regardless of its financial performance and such difficulty may preclude the company from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

the company is exposed to credit risk through its water wastewater and other waterrelated services provided by the regulated businesses and marketbased businesses the company’s regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while the marketbased businesses engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers the company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances the company’s credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements the company’s credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition the regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities the company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixedincome securities that have a duration similar to that of its pension liabilities seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities that way if interest rates fall and liabilities increase the company expects that the fixedincome assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value the company also expects its risk to be reduced through its ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates 

the company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates the credit quality of the company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore the company’s ability to fully recover operating expense recover its investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in the regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

business 

tableend the company 

with a history dating back to 1886  american water is the largest and most geographically diverse publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the united states as measured by both operating revenues and population served a holding company originally incorporated in delaware in 1936  the company employs approximately 6800 professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to approximately 15 million people in 46 states the company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services collectively presented as the “ regulated businesses ” the company also operates marketbased businesses that provide complementary services individually these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and are collectively presented as the “ marketbased businesses ” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses 

throughout this form 10k unless the context otherwise requires references to “we” “us” “our” the “company” and “american water” mean american water works company inc and its subsidiaries taken together as a whole references to “parent company” mean american water works company inc without its subsidiaries 

regulated businesses 

the company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial public authority fire service and sale for resale customers the company’s utilities operate in approximately 1700 communities in 16 states in the united states with over 34 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks services provided by the company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation collectively referred to as public utility commissions “pucs” federal state and local governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters the company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in the regulated businesses segment operating revenues for the regulated businesses were 3094 million for 2019  2984 million for 2018 and 2958 million for 2017  accounting for 86  87 and 88  respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods 

presented in the table below is a geographic summary of the regulated businesses ’ operating revenues and the number of customers the company serves by type of service for and as of the year ended december 31 2019  



 customers 

the company’s regulated businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base a customer is defined as a person business municipality or any other entity that purchases the company’s water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period one single customer may purchase the company’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses such as homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities 

the vast majority of the company’s regulated water customers are metered which allows the company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage typically on a monthly basis the company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption these methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption 

residential customers make up a substantial portion of the company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates the company also serves i commercial customers such as food and beverage providers commercial property developers and proprietors and energy suppliers ii fire service customers where the company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities iii industrial customers such as largescale manufacturers mining and production operations iv public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools and universities and v other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers 

the following chart depicts the allocation of the company’s regulated businesses ’ operating revenue of 3094 million by type including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer for the year ended december 31 2019  

 presented in the table below is the number of water and wastewater customers the company served by class as of december 31 





customer growth in the company’s regulated businesses is primarily from i adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water andor wastewater utility systems ii population growth in its authorized service areas and iii sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems 

capital investment 

excluding acquisitions the company plans to invest 82 billion over the next five years and between 18 billion and 19 billion over the next 10 years including 16 billion in 2020  for capital improvements to its regulated businesses ’ water and wastewater infrastructure largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities the company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 115year replacement cycle by 2024 which it anticipates will enable the company to replace nearly 2000 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2020 and 2024 in addition from 2020 to 2024 the company’s capital investment in treatment plants storage tanks and other key aboveground facilities is expected to increase further addressing infrastructure renewal resiliency water quality operational efficiency technology and innovation and emerging regulatory compliance needs additionally the company is investing significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets recently completed projects include the 25 million raised floodwall project at new jersey’s raritan millstone water treatment plant which provides protection against a 500 year flood and the 15 million bel air maryland reservoir project which provides 90 million gallons of drought mitigation water storage for the region 

regulation and rate making 

the operations of the company’s regulated businesses are generally subject to regulation by pucs in the states in which they operate with the primary responsibility of the pucs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs review and approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital operation and maintenance “om” expenses capital expenditures taxes affiliated transactions and relationships reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the puc the timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions the company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag” which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates 

the company’s regulated businesses support regulatory practices at the pucs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices 



the company pursues enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments in order to continue to provide safe clean reliable and affordable services to its customers the ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these regulatory practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes it is also the company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply 

acquisitions and strategic growth 

the us water and wastewater industries include investorowned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions according to the us environmental protection agency “epa” as of 2017 approximately 84 of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98 of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned the epa also estimates that there are approximately 50000 community water systems and approximately 15000 community wastewater systems in the united states with approximately 80 of the community water systems serving a population of 3000 or less 

a fundamental aspect of the company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water andor wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the company operates its regulated businesses  the proximity of acquisition opportunities to the company’s regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using its existing management although the company typically retains the majority if not all of the employees and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs the company’s current customer mix of 93 water and 7 wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation allowing it to add wastewater customers where the company already serves water customers the company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and if appropriate pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the company does not currently operate its regulated businesses  before entering new regulated markets the company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to its customers as well as a line of sight to grow the company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market 

increasingly stringent environmental health and safety and water quality regulations the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets

in 2017 new jersey enacted the water quality accountability act the “wqaa” which sets operational standards for all water utilities in new jersey including municipal and investorowned utilities with more than 500 service connections this law imposes requirements in areas such as cybersecurity asset management water quality reporting remediation of notices of violation and hydrant and valve maintenance the wqaa requires the most senior water manager or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems to certify that the system meets the requirements under the wqaa in 2019 the new jersey senate held three hearings on the wqaa and is expected to introduce legislation in the new 2020 legislative session that would strengthen accountability for obligations under the wqaa 

in 2018 similar legislation was passed in indiana that set new operational requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants as part of the permitting process for construction installation or modification of sources facilities equipment or devices these requirements include capital asset management plans that include annual reviews of infrastructure needs engineering analysis of useful life and a rate analysis to support the capital asset management plan a life cycle costbenefit analysis must be done comparing owning and operating a plant to other alternatives to supply water or wastewater services cybersecurity plans must also be developed in 2019 additional legislation was passed which set requirements for access to loans or grants such as participation in regional planning events use of current capital asset management programs and elimination of the causes of nonrevenue water the finance authority was also required to establish project prioritization that included consideration of project effects on public health and safety user rates and charges plans for collaboration plans to manage nonrevenue water and use of best practices 

also in 2018 america’s water infrastructure act of 2018 was signed into law the legislation includes policies intended to improve water and wastewater system management and authorization for states to assess consolidation options for systems that do not comply with the federal safe drinking water act and its rules and regulations the legislation increases funding to water system funding programs including the state revolving loan fund program and the water infrastructure finance and innovation act of 2014 “wifia” 

the company’s regulated subsidiaries in california illinois indiana iowa maryland missouri new jersey and pennsylvania have access to fair market value legislation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems the company supports full optionality for municipalities including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through thirdparty fair market valuations of purchased property fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation providing municipalities with a purchase price that is reflective of the assets’ market value while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over the life of the assets subject to state regulatory commission approval 

consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state as a result consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state overall this brings costeffective higher quality services to a larger number of citizens twelve of the company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing including california illinois indiana iowa kentucky maryland missouri new jersey new york pennsylvania virginia and west virginia 

in 2018 legislation was enacted in the company’s missouri and california subsidiaries changing the public vote requirement for the sale of water or wastewater systems in missouri the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than 500 small towns historically only larger communities required a simple majority while smaller communities needed a twothirds majority this legislation increases the options for small towns should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale in california the vote required to allow cities to sell sewer systems changed to a simple majority from a twothirds majority 

competition 

the company’s regulated businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because i the company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises charters certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations collectively “cpcns” issued by state pucs or other authorities and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry however the company’s regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions when pursuing acquisitions the company’s largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are essential utilities inc formerly known as aqua america inc suez north america american states water company and california water service group from time to time the company also faces competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as algonquin power and utilities corp eversource energy and corix 

condemnation and eminent domain 

all or portions of the regulated businesses ’ utility assets could be acquired by state municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods i eminent domain also known as condemnation ii the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original cpcn was granted and iii the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its cpcn the acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular cpcn 

as such the regulated businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business for example a citizens group in monterey california successfully added “measure j” to the november 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the monterey peninsula water management district the “mpwmd” should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of the monterey water service system assets the “monterey system assets” of the company’s california subsidiary and if feasible to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote this service territory represents approximately 40000 customers in november 2018 measure j was certified to have passed 

on august 19 2019 the mpwmd’s general manager issued a report that recommends that the mpwmd board 1 develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition 2 examine the feasibility of acquiring the monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the mpwmd becomes the owner of a larger system 3 evaluate whether it is in the public interest to acquire the monterey system assets and sufficiently satisfy the criterion of “feasible” as provided in measure j 4 ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition and 5 develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a resolution of necessity 

on november 6 2019 the mpwmd issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report finding in part that 1 an estimate of the monterey system assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately 513 million 2 the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills and 3 the acquisition of the monterey system assets by the mpwmd would be economically feasible the mpwmd will hold public hearings regarding the findings contained in this preliminary report if the mpwmd were to make a final determination that an acquisition of the monterey system assets is feasible then the mpwmd would commence a multiyear eminent domain proceeding against the company’s california subsidiary to first establish the mpwmd’s right to take the monterey system assets and if such right is established to determine the amount of just compensation to be paid to the california subsidiary for such assets 

also five municipalities in the chicago illinois area approximately 30300 customers in total formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against the company’s illinois subsidiary in january 2013 seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities before filing its eminent domain lawsuit the water agency made an offer of 38 million for the pipeline a jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline the parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports although the date of the valuation trial has not currently been scheduled it is not likely to commence before the second quarter of 2020 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which the regulated businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently in california lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property in some cases the puc has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed also the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance 

water supply and wastewater services 

the company’s regulated businesses generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to its customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater typically the company does not own the water which is held in public trust and is allocated to the company through contracts permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multistate agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law the company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from groundwater sources such as wells and aquifers and water purchased from thirdparty water suppliers the level of water treatment the company applies varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only 

presented in the chart below are the company’s sources of water supply as of december 31 2019  

presented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the company’s top seven states for 2019  



the company’s ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water the company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of the company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes it might encounter in any particular service territory for example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas the company serves may experience wetter than average weather 

the company evaluates quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that the company has adequate water supply it uses longterm planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources the company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development an example of the company’s use of longterm planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” in california the water supply project includes the construction of a desalination plant owned by the company’s california subsidiary and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant in addition the water supply project also includes the california subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” between monterey one water formerly known as the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the mpwmd the water supply project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of the california subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under orders of the california state water resources control board the “swrcb” for more information see item 3—legal proceedings —alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

seasonality 

customer demand for the company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use as such the company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year weather that is hotter andor drier than average generally increases operating revenues whereas weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues three of the company’s jurisdictions california illinois and new york have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the company to collect state pucauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period thereby lessening the impact of weather variability see “ regulation and rate making ” for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms 

marketbased businesses 

the company’s marketbased businesses provide complementary home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers and water and wastewater services to the us government on military installations as well as municipalities utilities and industrial customers these businesses are not subject to regulation by state pucs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment operating revenues for the company’s marketbased businesses were 539 million for 2019  476 million for 2018 and 422 million for 2017  accounting for 15  14 and 13  respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods 

the company’s primary marketbased businesses include the following operating segments 

 the company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its contract services group “ csg ” 

previously the company provided customized water transfer services for shale natural gas exploration and production companies through its keystone clearwater solutions llc “keystone” operations on december 12 2019  as part of a strategic review undertaken by the company the company sold all of its interest in keystone to a natural gas and oil industry investment group see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

homeowner services group 

the company’s homeowner services group  which includes the operations of pivotal home solutions “pivotal” acquired in june 2018 provides warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines interior gas and electric lines heating and cooling systems water heaters and other home appliances as well as power surge protection and other related services the company develops partnerships with municipalities utilities and other organizations to offer protection programs to customers serviced by or affiliated with those municipalities utilities and organizations the term of these partnership agreements with the municipalities utilities and other organizations is typically three to five years with mutual optional renewals as of december 31 2019  hos had approximately 3 million customer contracts in 43 states 

military services group 

the company’s military services group operates on 16 military installations under 50year contracts with the us government as part of its utility privatization program the scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and in certain instances systems expansion the replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the company is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract traditionally both of these programs are funded from the contract fee at times new assets are required to support the installation’s mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the us government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract the capital program historically has not used the company’s equity or debt borrowings rather the company has used limited working capital for shortterm needs under these contracts in april 2018 the us army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects however the us army’s implementation of this requirement has limited the need for financing of these projects and the company has been awarded several projects without any requirement to provide financing 

the contract price for nine of the company’s contracts with the us government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions the remaining seven contracts with the us government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called “economic price adjustment” all of these contracts could be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts the company would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs the company’s backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the us government is approximately 54 billion  with an average remaining contract term of 42 years 

competition 

the company’s marketbased businesses face competition from a number of service providers including homeserve usa and cinch home services in hos  and american states water company suez north america and veolia environnement sa in msg  

environmental health and safety water quality and other regulation 

the company’s water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both its regulated businesses and marketbased businesses  are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water the company delivers to its customers and the manner in which it collects treats discharges recycles and disposes of wastewater in the united states these regulations are developed under legislation including the safe drinking water act the reduction of lead in drinking water act and the clean water act environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard for example while the epa has issued a nonenforceable health advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds perfluorooctanoic acid or pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate or pfos the new jersey department of environmental protection is developing drinking water standards for these two compounds and has adopted a standard for a third compound perfluorononanoic acid or pfna as well as other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or pfas the company is also subject to various federal state local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the company delivers 

the company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations and effective use of natural resources which is important given the overall trend that drinking water standards have become increasingly more stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced the company’s capital and operating costs could increase the company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental health and safety and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring the company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately 600 million over the next five years for environmental control facilities which the company defines for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land the company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations 

the company’s operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example the company’s water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements the company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its offsite disposal of wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” authorizes the epa and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under cercla or comparable state laws although the company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs the company’s facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the us occupational safety and health act and inspections thereunder certain of the company’s subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters see item 3—legal proceedings for additional information 

safe drinking water act 

the safe drinking water act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements to date the epa has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years 

to help formulate the basis for future regulations the epa has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule the “monitoring rule” the company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the monitoring rule in previous rounds which occurs every five years and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2020 there are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology the process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex but the company actively participates with the epa and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge see “research and development—emerging containments” for additional information 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in 2006 the epa issued the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule and finalized the ground water rule which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources in 2016 the revised total coliform rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects the company is within the epa’s time frame for compliance with these standards which includes sample collection data analysis engineering planning and system implementation recent monitoring under the longterm 2 rule has resulted in the need for more than 30 of the company’s surface water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium in many cases this will involve installing uv disinfection and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades an estimated 150 million to 250 million of investment will still be required for the remaining facilities further the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds the company does not anticipate that any such regulations if enacted will require implementation in 2020 

the company conducts over one million water quality tests each year at its laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water the company participates in the partnership for safe water the epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 69 of the company’s 80 surface water treatment plants receiving the epa program’s prestigious “director” award which recognizes utilities that i have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report ii created an action plan for continuous improvement and iii produced highquality drinking water the company accounts for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 67 of the company’s surface water treatment plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award 62 plants have received the “tenyear phase iii” award 58 plants have received the “fifteenyear phase iii” award and three plants have received the “twentyyear phase iii” award these awards recognize plants that have met the director award status for five 10 15 and 20 years respectively further nine of the company’s surface water plants have received the “presidents” award which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements the company expects current requirements under the safe drinking water act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result the company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

lead and copper rule and reduction of lead in drinking water act 

in 1991 the epa published the lead and copper rule “lcr” to control lead and copper in drinking water and since that time has issued minor revisions in 2000 2004 and 2007 enhancing monitoring reporting and public education requirements in 2011 congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings for fixtures solder and flux while these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water legacy lead plumbing materials primarily in building plumbing still remain in many communities the failure of certain water systems in the united states to comply with the requirements of the lcr has received recent media attention and scrutiny and in certain cases has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects the company has started to replace lsls in accordance with current scientific guidance also the company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements the epa proposed revisions to the lcr in november 2019 designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water the company continues to review the implications of the lcr and comments on the proposed revisions to the rule were due to the epa by february 12 2020 the company will develop an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements if and when adopted prior to the compliance effective dates in the final rule capital expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisions cannot be determined until the final rule is promulgated but costs associated with compliance with federal regulations have been traditionally recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates 

the company currently estimates that approximately 5 of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the company or customer portion of the service line “lsls” the company is replacing lsls as part of ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects the company’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known lsls in most service areas by the end of 2030 at an estimated cost ranging from 600 million to 12 billion  the company believes this will be attainable for most service areas where public policy is supportive of this goal with regard to future acquisitions the company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set lsl removal goals appropriate for those systems the prioritization of lsl removal plan is dependent on several factors including the company’s planned water main and service line renewal projects adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities lcr compliance monitoring results and cooperation with its customers with respect to replacing the customerowned portion of the lsl as necessary in certain cases these factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement because replacing the external lsl in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the us national drinking water advisory council the lead service line replacement collaborative and the american water works association the company’s preferred approach is to replace the entire external lsl if lead is found on either the company or customer portion of the service line the lead service line replacement collaborative is a diverse group of public health water utility environmental labor consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of lsls through collaborative efforts at the local level 

clean water act 

the clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to the company’s wastewater collection systems its operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act which must be renewed every five years pursuant to the npdes permit program the epa and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems discharges that exceed the limits specified under npdes permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and persistent noncompliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs in addition the difficulty of obtaining and complying with npdes permits and renewing expiring permits may impose time and cost burdens on the company’s operations from time to time discharge violations occur at the company’s facilities some of which result in fines the company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition 

environmental social responsibility and governance 

the company considers environmental social responsibility and governance “esg” to include environmental leadership and sustainability operational excellence employee engagement safety and equality active community engagement civic and charitable involvement and transparency and good governance integration of these principles into the company’s daily operations emphasizes its belief that “how” a company operates is just as important as “what” a company does

the company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborate with the epa and state agencies to help establish effective environmental health and safety and water quality standards and regulation this relationship includes the sharing of the company’s research such as its treatment and distribution system optimization research and its national water quality monitoring data the company’s engagement with the epa provides it with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing the company to anticipate and to accommodate its future compliance requirements the company also frequently engages with the centers for disease control other state environmental agencies and national and international water research foundations the company believes that continued rd activities are critical for providing safe reliable and affordable services as well as maintaining its leadership position in the industry which provides the company with a competitive advantage as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers 

emerging contaminants 

emerging contaminants include numerous chemicals such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides herbicides and endocrine disrupting compounds as well as some naturally occurring microbes such as bacteria viruses and parasites which have been detected in drinking water supplies for which the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood andor has not been quantified while these contaminants have been present in drinking water for as long as they have been in use technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them the ability to detect contaminants even at trace levels has raised questions among regulators and government agencies further affecting the public’s perception of drinking water quality 

the chemicals abstract service registry contains over 159 million registered chemicals with an estimated 1400 species of diseasecausing microbes that can affect humans the company is continually investigating new substances and contaminants employing a team of scientists engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to its water supply to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies the company maintains stateoftheart water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues examples of the company’s efforts include

 item 1a risk factors 

we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business operations 

our utility operations are subject to extensive regulation by state pucs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our utility operations also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these regulatory requirements 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state pucs this regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to 

 approval of the pucs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations some state pucs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations our utilities are also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the pucs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions dispositions and in certain cases affiliated transactions although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business 

in any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the level estimated in establishing rates 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations including with respect to emerging contaminants compliance with which could impact both our operating costs and capital expenditures and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs as well as damage to our reputation 

our regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our marketbased businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations these requirements include among others the clean water act the safe drinking water act the lcr and cercla epa requirements and similar federal and state laws and regulations for example state pucs and environmental regulators set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

in addition cercla authorizes the epa to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our regulated businesses through customer rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination including potential releases of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

attention is being given to emerging contaminants including without limitation chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances examples of sources of emerging contaminants include but are not limited to newly created chemical compounds including for example manufactured nanomaterials human and veterinary products perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds bacteria microbes viruses amoebae and other pathogens and residual byproducts of disinfection we rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants and our role is to provide service that meets these standards if any in some of our states pucs may disapprove of cost recovery in whole or in part for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard furthermore given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created andor discovered we may not be able to detect andor mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation in addition we believe emerging contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future which could significantly increase the cost of our operations 

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time and vary by state or region may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water 

for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 20 2009 cease and desist order the “2009 order” as amended by an order in july 2016 the “2016 order” of the swrcb that requires californiaamerican water company our wholly owned subsidiary “cal am” to significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on december 31 2021 the “2021 deadline” we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act we cannot predict whether cal am will be able to secure alternative sources of water or if cal am will be exposed to liabilities including fines and penalties if it is unable to meet the 2021 deadline under the 2016 order furthermore cal am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information to obtain the required approvals for the water supply project however due to the delay in the approval schedule cal am currently does not believe that it will be able to fully comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order and the 2016 order including the 2021 deadline if cal am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected see item 3—legal proceedings —alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions which includes additional information regarding this matter 

climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise 

the issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability many climate variability predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities including us such as 

 because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our regulated businesses could be recovered through rates infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms there can be no assurance that state pucs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs in whole or in part 

the current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay also known as “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business 

there is typically a delay known as “regulatory lag” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory policies for example three of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently in addition 11 of our state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates furthermore in setting rates ten of our state pucs allow us to use future test years which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the general rate case application process 

while these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs furthermore pucs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form or at all although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected 

changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions including without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax laws can materially affect our operations results of operations and cash flows the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others 



 any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

in addition new federal state and local laws changes in existing laws rules or regulations or administrative interpretations thereof could impact us in december 2017 the tcja was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as of january 1 2018 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including the normalization of our deferred income taxes the enactment of the tcja required remeasurement of our deferred income taxes which materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position and had a lesser impact on our 2018 results of operations and financial position following enactment of the tcja the company adjusted its customer rates and deferred income taxes to reflect the lower income tax rate as mandated by pucs in jurisdictions that have addressed the issue we expect that further impacts to our deferred income taxes will continue to occur through pending or future rate cases or other proceedings in the remaining jurisdictions at this time we cannot predict the impacts on us of the regulatory treatment of the tcja in these remaining proceedings or of the enactment or adoption of any related interpretations if and when issued moreover we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts if any of any other new or amended laws rules or regulations or interpretations thereof including without limitation further amendments to the code or applicable treasury regulations to the extent they may be ultimately enacted adopted or issued on us or our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service interruptions due to severe weather climate variability patterns and other natural events are possible across all our businesses these include among other things storms freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes landslides drought wildfires coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains severe electrical storms sinkholes and solar flares weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our regulated businesses may not provide reimbursement to us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system responses may range from voluntary to mandatory water use restrictions rationing restrictions water conservation regulations and requirements to minimize water system leaks while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant puc determines they were reasonable and prudent we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will in fact be fully recovered moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

a loss of one or more large industrial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our regulated businesses 

adverse economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations tariffs in place with respect to our regulated businesses may not reimburse us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment and to improve aging infrastructure in 2019  we invested 17 billion in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and may increase we expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt and equity we may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper longterm debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all if we are not able to obtain sufficient financing we may be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

aging infrastructure may lead to service disruptions property damage and increased capital expenditures and om costs all of which could negatively impact our financial results 

we have risks associated with aging infrastructure including water and sewer mains pumping stations and water and wastewater treatment facilities additionally the nature of information available on buried and newly acquired assets may be limited which may challenge our ability to conduct efficient asset management and maintenance practices assets that have aged beyond their expected useful lives may experience a higher rate of failure failure of aging infrastructure could result in increased capital expenditures and om costs and negatively impact our future om efficiency ratio in addition failure of aging infrastructure may result in property damage and in safety environmental and public health impacts to the extent that any increased costs or expenditures are not fully recovered in rates our results of operations liquidity and cash flows could be negatively impacted 

seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues 

the volume of water we sell during the warmer months typically in the summer is generally greater than during other months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

three of our jurisdictions california illinois and new york have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to collect state pucauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recover the fixed cost of operations while supporting water conservation goals in those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks if collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions damage to our reputation and private litigation 

the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system or the water service that is provided to our customers may be subject to contamination including among other items contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate methyl tertiary butyl ether lead and other materials chemical spills or other accidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks in addition new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water industry if one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 continuing limited use of the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply if service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods we may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance customer rates tariffs or contract terms any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies 

since we engage in the business of providing water service to our customers contamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur and we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water or water supplies in addition insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses and are subject to deductibles and other limitations pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations as well as the operations of our marketbased businesses  our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make generally our insurance policies cover property damage worker’s compensation employer’s liability general liability cybersecurity terrorism risks and automobile liability each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims as a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles 

we are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions 

our business and operations have a large direct and indirect customer base and as a result we are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of their water wastewater and related or ancillary services the quality of water provided and the amount timeliness accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies state pucs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative regulatory and economic outcomes as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our marketbased businesses  as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

for example new york american water company inc “nyaw” has been the subject of a new york state public service commission “nyspsc” investigation related to the unintentional provision of incorrect data to a taxing authority that resulted in an overassessment of real property taxes nyaw selfreported this issue to the nyspsc promptly after nyaw’s senior leadership became aware of it neither nyaw nor any of its employees received any financial benefit as a result of this matter as all customer overpayments were provided to the local taxing authorities the nyspsc investigation also related to the failure of a few employees working on nyaw’s 2016 general rate case to properly disclose these issues in that rate case in september 2018 a settlement of these matters was approved by the supreme court of the state of new york albany county and nyaw has been working with the new york state department of public service to implement its terms while the settlement resolves the nyspsc’s investigation involving nyaw and those matters set forth above there can be no assurance that nyaw will not be subject to additional federal state or local proceedings regarding these and other related matters and these proceedings could result in increased oversight and civil administrative andor criminal sanctions which may have a material adverse effect upon our reputation and perception 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

the properties of our regulated businesses segment include 76 dams the majority of which are earthen dams and the failure of any of which could result in personal injury and property damage including without limitation downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs although in most cases the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future the inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries property and other damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments 

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems which involves risks including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business 

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and optimization of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 

the negotiation and execution of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in among other things 



 some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business the systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability or other perceived synergies and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions 

our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process a municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group may seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition 

for example in november 2018 monterey california ballot measure j was certified as having been approved by a public vote requiring the mpwmd to conduct a study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of the monterey system assets without an additional public vote on november 6 2019 the mpwmd issued a preliminary report finding among other things that the acquisition of the monterey system assets by the mpwmd would be economically feasible also five municipalities in the chicago illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our illinois subsidiary in january 2013 seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities this lawsuit remains pending and a valuation trial is likely to be held in the near future see item 1—business—regulated businesses—condemnation and eminent domain  which includes additional information regarding these matters 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our regulated businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently in california lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property in some cases the puc has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits 

contesting an exercise of condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation eminent domain or other process may not be successful which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity 

we rely on operational and technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our operational and technology systems are an integral part of our business and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations for example we depend on these systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage certain plant operations and construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources supply chain inventory and accounts receivable collections 

although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure than other similar organizations our technology systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer employee or financial data security breaches misappropriation of property and other adverse consequences in addition a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be subject to physical andor cyber attacks 

as operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical andor cyber attacks from internal or external sources our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes our operational and technology systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties further third parties including vendors suppliers and contractors who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access while we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational and technology systems those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities we cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack 

if despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred our operations could be disrupted property damaged and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss suffer a loss of management time attention and resources from our regular business operations and be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties these types of events either impacting our facilities or the industry in general could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs 

in addition in the ordinary course of business we collect and retain sensitive information including personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in many cases we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks any theft loss andor fraudulent use of customer employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation liability and costs as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators among others 

we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates 

our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational and technology systems or implement new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks or the implementation of new systems may require substantial amounts of management’s time and financial resources to complete and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors including employees’ ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system we continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions and have installed new and upgraded existing technology systems these efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations and enhance our customer service capabilities any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting we may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls business and operations we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated and any such impacts could harm our business individually or collectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

an inability to successfully develop and implement new technologies poses substantial risks to our business and operational excellence strategies which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

a significant part of our longterm strategic focus on safety operational excellence om expense efficiency water quality asset and capital management and the customer experience includes the development and implementation of new technologies to be used for among other things customer service and support environmental compliance water metering water quality and source monitoring cybersecurity business development and growth data analysis employee development and training and other initiatives for example we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in developing deploying and maintaining customerfacing technologies applications to support field service and customer service operations water source sensor and evaluation technologies and data analysis and artificial intelligence technologies where appropriate we also seek to align these new technologies with existing technology infrastructure and systems 

there can be no assurance that we will be successful in designing developing deploying integrating or maintaining these new technologies and if they do not perform effectively or adequately serve their respective business objectives their value to us and our business and operations may be negatively and materially impacted because these efforts can be longterm in nature these new technologies may be more costly or timeconsuming than expected to design develop integrate and complete and may not ultimately deliver the expected or desired benefits upon completion technologies that do not perform as intended or desired may need to be redesigned redeveloped or abandoned while we have and will continue to seek to recover costs and earn a return on capital expenditures with respect to the costs and expenses of development and deployment of these new technologies in our regulated businesses there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in every instance or at all our failure to timely and effectively invest in develop deploy and implement improvements to and properly maintain the operation and integrity of our new technologies including related data and other related systems andor adequately obtain recovery in rates of the costs and expenses associated with such activities may adversely affect our ability to achieve intended om expense efficiencies or other key performance results and ultimately could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

all of the intellectual property that has been or is being used or developed in connection with these technologies we believe we own or have valid licenses to use however competitors contracting parties or other third parties may bring claims against us to challenge our right to use license sublicense market or monetize in whole or in part such intellectual property or derivatives thereof or works made therefrom and the assertion defense or protection of our intellectual property rights could be expensive timeconsuming and ultimately unsuccessful if we are unable to do so or it is determined that we do not own or have valid licenses or other rights to any of the intellectual property used in our technologies we may lose valuable rights to what we regard as our intellectual property the carrying values of the affected technologies may need to be decreased significantly and we may be required to obtain or purchase licenses at significant cost from third parties to use the intellectual property in any of these cases we may be unable to execute our longterm strategy and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted 

our business has inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life and be exposed to financial losses including penalties and other liabilities 

safety is a core value and a strategy at american water our safety performance and continual progress to our ultimate desired goal of zero injuries is critical to our reputation we maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers contractors vendors and the public although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards with a goal of achieving zero injuries it is extremely challenging to eliminate all safety incidents at all times 

at our business sites including construction and maintenance sites our employees contractors and others are often in close proximity to large pieces of equipment moving vehicles pressurized water underground trenches and vaults chemicals and other regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement important safety procedures and practices above what governmental regulations require if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others our employees contractors and others may experience minor serious or fatal injuries unsafe work sites have the potential to increase employee turnover expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our operations can involve the delivery handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly delivered handled stored or disposed of could result in serious injury death environmental damage or property damage and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health and safety work procedures and practices throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

as of december 31 2019  approximately 46 of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 71 collective bargaining agreements in place with 14 different unions representing our unionized employees these collective bargaining agreements including four which are beyond expiration and 14 which will expire during 2020  are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation we may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that are fair to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers licensed operators water quality and other operating and craft personnel and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely impacted 

financial and marketrelated risks 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2019  our aggregate longterm and shortterm debt balance including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 95 billion  and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 



in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue a combination of new shortterm and longterm debt securities and equity moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2020  2021 and 2022 will be 28 million  310 million and 14 million  respectively we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms if at all moreover if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

in an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt we have in the past entered into and in the future may enter into financial derivative instruments including without limitation interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  however these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance which will be affected by the financial business economic competitive legislative including tax initiatives and reforms and other similar legislation or regulation regulatory and other risk factors described in this section many of which are beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected materially and adversely 

our inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility commercial paper program and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external sources of shortterm liquidity are our 210 billion commercial paper program and our 225 billion revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility currently expires in accordance with its terms in march 2024 although under those terms we may request to extend the expiration date for up to one year we regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2019  american water capital corp “awcc” our wholly owned financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had 786 million of commercial paper outstanding and 76 million in outstanding letters of credit there can be no assurance that awcc will be able to continue to access its commercial paper program or its revolving credit facility when as and if desired or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable or any cost 

under the terms of our revolving credit facility our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70 of our consolidated capitalization as determined under the terms of the credit facility if our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable to avoid such a default a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility 

our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties including events beyond our control for example events that could cause a reduction in equity include without limitation a significant writedown of our goodwill even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete 

disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all for example o n april 1 2019 moody’s investors service changed the company’s senior unsecured debt rating to baa1 from a3 with a stable outlook while the lending banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments these or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or capital markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of economic legislative political or other uncertainty including as a result of changes in us tax and other laws reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital debt or credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures finally there is no assurance that we will be able to access the equity capital markets to obtain financing when necessary or desirable and on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us 

any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

parent company may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds 

parent company is a holding company and as such it has no substantive operations of its own substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries parent company’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to parent company prior to paying dividends to parent company our regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and our covenants and other agreements our subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay or upstream dividends to parent company a failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and parent company’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations 

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2019  we had us federal and state nol carryforwards of approximately 673 million and 453 million  respectively and management believes it is more likely than not that these nol carryforwards will be recovered in the future with the enactment of the tcja the company analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities including its nol carryforwards and as a result remeasured those nol carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the tcja based on this tax rate change 

our federal nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028  and our state nol carryforwards began to expire in 2019 and will continue to expire through 2038 we expect to fully utilize our federal nol balance before it expires and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our state nol carryforwards and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income 

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover adoption of related interpretations with respect to the tcja and other changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of our nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include 15 billion of goodwill at december 31 2019  the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and our acquisition of pivotal in 2018 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business these market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or other circumstances for example in the third quarter of 2018 prior to our sale of keystone we strategically narrowed the scope of that business and as a result we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of 57 million  see note 8—goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization the effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators 

market volatility and other conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations and volatility which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the sec the financial accounting standards board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies these changes are beyond our control can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which could also adversely affect our previously reported results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure 

our internal controls accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap taxation requirements federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us such compliance permits us to among other things disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities tax and other laws and regulations 

we have implemented corporate governance internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” and relevant sec rules as well as other applicable regulations such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and board of directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws rules and regulations management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls while we believe these controls policies practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting the consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition the inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also harm our reputation increase financing costs or adversely affect our or awcc’s ability to access the capital markets 

additional risks related to our marketbased businesses 

we excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our marketbased businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased businesses do not satisfy these obligations 

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits primarily related to msg in the event our marketbased businesses fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

at december 31 2019  we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 54 billion related to msg’s contracts and this amount is likely to increase if the number of bases served by msg increases the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 

our marketbased businesses’ operations under msg are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the us government 

msg enters into contracts with the us government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems which contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to either an annual economic price adjustment or a redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter annual economic price adjustment is an inflation indexbased contract price increase mechanism price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable annual economic price adjustment or price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

moreover entering into contracts with the us government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations we are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which are complex and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the us government or our existing contracts could be terminated which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows

legal proceedings 

tableend alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

compliance with swrcb orders to reduce carmel river diversions 

under the 2009 order cal am is required among other things to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule the 2009 order responded to claims that cal am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the carmel river as required by a 1995 order of the swrcb in july 2016 at the request of cal am and several monterey county government agencies the swrcb issued the 2016 order approving the 2021 deadline 

the 2009 order includes a condition prohibiting cal am from diverting water from the carmel river for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use in 2011 the california public utilities commission the “cpuc” issued a decision directing modifications in cal am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 order and directing cal am to seek written guidance from the swrcb with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition in 2012 the deputy director of the swrcb sent a letter to cal am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses in march 2018 the mpwmd adopted a resolution directing cal am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the swrcb’s written interpretation in may 2018 cal am notified the mpwmd and the swrcb that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 order in an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention cal am has met with the mpwmd and the swrcb several times the swrcb agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter which would be subject to a public comment period any failure to follow the mpwmd’s resolution or the swrcb’s written interpretation despite these conflicting interpretations could potentially result in fines penalties and other actions against cal am 

the 2016 order provides that if the cpuc authorizes cal am to acquire more than 1000 acrefeet per year of water from a source other than the water supply project proponents of the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the swrcb for consideration in may 2018 certain parties to the water supply project proceeding submitted a petition to the swrcb to add parallel milestones to the 2009 order for 2019 2020 and 2021 based on the proposed expansion of the pure water monterey project another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the monterey peninsula petitioners claim that compliance with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of cal am’s unauthorized diversions from the carmel river by 2021 a preliminary report on feasibility concluded that the expanded pure water monterey project could provide an additional 2250 acrefeet of water per year cal am believes that i the petition is premature ii the expanded pure water monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and even if construction is successfully completed would provide an insufficient quantity of water to allow full compliance with the 2009 order and iii the imposition of parallel milestones would distract from completion of the water supply project on december 13 2019 the swrcb dismissed the petition without prejudice 

cal am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for the water supply project however based on the matters discussed below in “monterey peninsula water supply project” there can be no assurance that the water supply project in its current configuration will be completed on a timely basis if ever due to the delay in the approval schedule cal am currently does not believe that it will be able to fully comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order and the 2016 order including the 2021 deadline the cpuc’s final decision approving the water supply project permits recovery of all of cal am’s prudently incurred costs associated therewith subject to the frameworks set forth in the final decision related to cost caps om costs financing ratemaking and contingency matters cal am currently believes that its expenditures to date have been prudent and necessary to comply with the 2009 order and the 2016 order further attempts to comply with the 2009 order and the 2016 order or the 2021 deadline may result in material additional costs or obligations to cal am and failure to comply could lead to fines and penalties against cal am 

regional desalination project litigation 

review of cpucapproved settlement agreement 

the regional desalination project the “rdp” involved the construction of a desalination facility in the city of marina north of monterey the rdp was intended to among other things eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under the 2009 order in december 2010 the cpuc approved the rdp which was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cal am in 2011 due to a conflict of interest concerning a former member of mcwra’s board of directors mcwra stated that the agreements were void and as a result cal am terminated the agreements in april 2015 the cpuc approved a settlement agreement among cal am mcwra and the county of monterey to resolve these matters among the parties signing the agreement in march 2016 the supreme court of california granted mcwd’s petition for review of the cpuc approval and following the court’s disposition of a related issue in another case mcwd’s petition for review of the cpucapproved settlement agreement was remanded to the cpuc on september 19 2019 the cpuc issued a decision affirming its prior decisions with respect to the settlement agreement that resolved matters among the parties thereto associated with the termination of the rdp agreements after considering the issue remanded by the california supreme court

cpuc final approval of water supply project 

cal am’s ability to move forward on the water supply project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc and other government agencies obtaining necessary permits and intervention from other parties in september 2016 the cpuc unanimously approved a decision to authorize cal am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the gwr project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to 50 million in associated costs subject to meeting certain criteria if construction costs exceed 50 million cal am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery 

in september 2018 the cpuc unanimously adopted a final decision finding that i the water supply project based on cal am’s request for a 64 million gallons per day desalination plant meets the cpuc’s requirements for a cpcn ii the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed and iii an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects the cpuc’s decision directs cal am to enter into negotiations regarding expansion of the gwr project between monterey one water and the mpwmd and to indicate whether cal am plans to file an application for approval of an agreement to purchase additional water from the gwr project the decision notes however that the cpuc will only consider such an application if the water supply project is delayed such that cal am would not be able to meet the 2021 deadline the decision accepts cal am’s estimates of future water demand in monterey and concludes that the water supply project is the best project to address those needs and adopts cal am’s most recent cost estimates the decision also allows cal am to earn an allowance for funds used during construction or afudc at a rate representative of its actual financing costs the final decision adopted frameworks as to cost caps om costs financing ratemaking and contingency matters 

in addition the cpuc final decision imposes numerous reporting and filing requirements to ensure the expenditures for the water supply project are reasonable including that the financing is the lowest cost and most beneficial for ratepayers and that construction is progressing in a timely manner and within the authorized cost caps the reasonableness of water supply project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by cal am after the water supply project becomes operational cal am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the water supply project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program a reimbursement agreement for cpuc costs associated with that program and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the water supply project in service

the proposed desalination plant for the water supply project is to be located in an unincorporated portion of monterey county california on a site owned by cemex inc “cemex” and requires a combined development permit from the county of monterey prior to commencement of construction on april 24 2019 the county’s planning commission voted to approve the permit on july 15 2019 the board of supervisors heard appeals filed by mcwd and a public advocacy group at which time it denied the appeals and approved the permit on august 21 2019 mcwd filed a petition in monterey county superior court challenging monterey county’s approval of cal am’s combined development permit application and seeking injunctive relief to enjoin monterey county and cal am from commencing construction of the desalination plant on october 9 2019 after a hearing the court denied without prejudice mcwd’s motion for a preliminary injunction but issued a stay of the county’s approval of the combined development permit precluding commencement of physical construction of the desalination plant until november 19 2019 at which time the parties were to advise the court of the coastal commission’s decision on cal am’s application for a coastal development permit for the slant wells needed to source water for the desalination plant in the interim cal am is allowed to continue to obtain permits needed for the desalination plant’s construction on november 19 2019 the parties informed the court that the coastal commission had continued its public hearing on the slant wells and had not yet made a determination about permitting the slant wells in response the court continued its stay until march 24 2020 

proposed zoning changes at cemex site for slant wells 

in august 2018 the city circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance and placed the matter for consideration on the planning commission’s agenda for its september 2018 meeting the proposed amendments would change zoning at the cemex site to open space and restrict future uses including with respect to cal am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the water supply project any change to the citys local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the coastal commission cal am cemex and the coastal commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments at its november 2018 meeting the planning commission adopted a resolution recommending that the marina city council consider approving the amendments 

in december 2018 the marina city council considered the proposed amendments cal am cemex and the coastal commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes but the city council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final which occurred at the city’s december 2018 meeting the changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the coastal commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained 

test slant well permitting 

a preliminary step to building the water supply project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under monterey bay in november 2014 the coastal commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well enabling cal am to construct and operate the test slant well because cal am may use the test slant well as one of the slant wells for the water supply project cal am sought and obtained from the coastal commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until february 28 2020 on november 27 2019 cal am filed an application with the coastal commission for a permit amendment to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained until february 28 2021 a required lease obtained from the california state lands commission as amended will expire on december 16 2022 effective february 28 2018 test slant well pumping ceased except for minimal maintenance pumping activities in accordance with cal am’s coastal development permits 

in november 2015 mcwd filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in santa cruz county superior court against the coastal commission and cal am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test well pumping in orders issued in september 2016 and october 2017 the court denied mcwd’s challenges in january 2018 mcwd filed a notice of appeal of the court’s judgment on june 28 2019 the california court of appeal dismissed mcwd’s appeal on july 15 2019 mcwd filed a petition for rehearing with the court of appeal which was denied on july 19 2019 this decision is now final 

water supply project land acquisition and slant well site use 

in july 2017 the coastal commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned by cemex on which intake wells for the water supply project will be located to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a nonprofit or governmental entity the consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves cal am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record a permanent easement granted by cemex to cal am was recorded in june 2018 to allow cal am access to the property and to construct operate and maintain the water supply project intake wells on november 26 2019 the city of marina notified cemex that based on this easement and cal am’s proposed use of the site for the intake wells cemex has breached or will soon breach a prior 1996 annexation agreement to which cal am was not a party the city states that it intends to seek declaratory relief from cemex and cal am ordering that cal am’s extraction is limited to 500 acrefeet per year of groundwater that cal am cannot export extracted water out of the basin and that the permanent easement granted by cemex to cal am is void the city has requested a meeting with cemex as part of a mandatory dispute resolution process under the annexation agreement prior to filing a lawsuit cemex has denied the city’s claims and requested indemnification from cal am under the terms of the permanent easement cal am and cemex believe that there is no valid limitation under the annexation agreement on cal am’s right to pump brackish groundwater and seawater at the site for desalination and use by cal am’s customers 

under california’s sustainable groundwater management act “sgma” enacted in 2015 groundwater basins designated by the state as critically overdrafted must be managed by a groundwater sustainability agency “gsa” by 2020 in accordance with an approved groundwater sustainability plan “gsp” designed to achieve sustainability by 2040 under the sgma gsas have broad powers to achieve sustainability including but not limited to regulating groundwater extraction by imposing fees on groundwater extractions and controlling groundwater extractions by regulating limiting or suspending extractions from wells the 400acre cemex site overlies a small portion of the 180400 subbasin of the salinas valley groundwater basin the 84000acre 180400 subbasin has been designated by the state as critically overdrafted mainly due to seawater intrusion into the subbasin 

in late 2016 the salinas valley basin groundwater sustainability agency “svbgsa” was formed as a joint powers authority to become the gsa for the salinas valley groundwater basin and prepare a gsp in april 2018 the city of marina filed a notice to become the gsa for the cemex site creating an overlap with the svbgsa’s filing for the 180400 subbasin in 2016 the svbgsa commenced preparation of a gsp covering the entire 180400 subbasin including the cemex site but in august 2019 the city filed a notice that it intends to prepare its own gsp for the cemex site with the intent to severely limit or prohibit groundwater pumping at that site the state department of water resources “sdwr” has taken the position that until the overlap is resolved it will not accept the gsp from either agency placing the subbasin at risk of being placed in a probationary status and subject to state management in december 2019 the county of monterey filed its own notice to become the exclusive gsa at the cemex site in order to resolve the overlap which is permitted under sgma sdwr accepted the county’s filing on december 18 2019 and now lists the county as the exclusive gsa for the site 

on december 30 2019 the city of marina filed a lawsuit in the supreme court of california challenging the county’s filing and sdwr’s acceptance of the filing as the exclusive gsa for the cemex site the city has named the county and its board of supervisors the county gsa and sdwr and its director as defendants and the svbgsa and its board of directors as real parties the city seeks to invalidate the county’s filing as well as injunctive relief to preserve the city’s status as a gsa for the site to protect its interest in the matter cal am filed an application to intervene in this lawsuit which is scheduled to be heard on february 18 2020

the enactment of the tcja required a remeasurement of the company’s deferred income taxes that materially impacted its 2017 results of operations and financial position the portion of this remeasurement related to the regulated businesses was substantially offset by a regulatory liability as the company believes it is probable that the excess accumulated deferred income taxes “eadit” created by the tcja will be used to benefit its regulated customers in future rates six of the company’s regulated subsidiaries are amortizing eadit and crediting customers including one which is using the eadit to offset future infrastructure investments the company expects the timing of the amortization of eadit credits by the eight remaining regulated subsidiaries to be addressed in pending or future rate cases or other proceedings

provision for income taxes 

in 2019  provision for income taxes increased 9 million primarily due to an increase in pretax income 

liquidity and capital resources 

the company regularly evaluates and monitors its cash requirements for capital investments acquisitions operations commitments debt maturities interest and dividends the company’s business is capital intensive with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations when necessary the company also obtains funds from external sources primarily in the debt markets and through shortterm commercial paper borrowings the company may also access the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements as needed the company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on its credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the utility and water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit the company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets 

if these business market financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that the company is no longer able to access the capital markets on reasonable terms awcc has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in march 2024 with aggregate bank commitments of 225 billion  the facility is used principally to fulfill its shortterm liquidity needs by supporting awcc’s 210 billion commercial paper program and to provide a sublimit of up to 150 million for letters of credit subject to satisfying certain conditions the credit agreement permits awcc to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to 500 million  

in order to meet shortterm liquidity needs awcc issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility as of december 31 2019  awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility with 225 billion available to fulfill its shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to provide support for 786 million in outstanding commercial paper the company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets the revolving credit facility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the company’s shortterm requirements the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets however there can no assurance that the lenders will be able to meet existing commitments to awcc under the revolving credit facility or that awcc will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all see “credit facilities and shortterm debt” below for additional information 

in addition the regulated businesses receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction 

the company uses its capital resources including cash primarily to i fund operating and capital requirements ii pay interest and meet debt maturities iii pay dividends iv fund acquisitions v fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations and vi the company estimates during 2020 to begin to pay federal income taxes the company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a longterm return on investment additionally the company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag see item 1—business — regulated businesses — regulation and rate making for additional information the company expects to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since the company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash flows from operating activities the company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next five years through a combination of longterm debt and equity if necessary the company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity in this event the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

with the enactment of the tcja and the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21  the company anticipates a decrease in future revenue authorizations associated with the regulated businesses  initially leading to lower cash flows the company expects this cash flow impact to decline over time as the regulated businesses ’ rate base grows the result of lower deferred income tax liabilities which offset rate base the lower deferred income tax liabilities are mainly due to i a lower us federal corporate income tax rate ii the normalization refunding to customers of the remeasured deferred income tax liabilities over the remaining life of the associated assets and iii the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects that began after september 27 2017 

one component of wifia is a federal credit program administered by the epa for eligible water and wastewater infrastructure projects the wifia program accelerates investment in the us’s water infrastructure by providing longterm lowcost supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significant projects the company is currently pursuing wifia financing of approximately 80 million for a project in the company’s missouri subsidiary 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

cash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the warmer months the company’s future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by among other things economic utility regulation inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs maintenance costs customer growth declining customer usage of water employeerelated costs including pension funding weather and seasonality taxes and overall economic conditions 

the enactment of the tcja is accretive to the company’s consolidated earnings over time through i growth in rate base for the same level of expected capital expenditures due to the impact of the lower us federal corporate income tax rate and the remeasurement of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities ii increased earnings in the marketbased businesses due to the lower us federal corporate income tax rate all partially offset by iii the lower tax shield on interest expense at parent company as well as increased debt levels from lower cash flows from operations as the company passes the lower tax rate benefits to its regulated customers the company believes that it will likely begin paying federal income taxes during 2020 when the company expects its federal nol carryforwards balance will be fully used although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in its future results of operations and the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the tcja 

cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund the majority of the company’s capital investments the company expects to seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of its capital investment if any and fund its dividend payments as needed operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in the company’s rate regulated environments changes in the marketbased businesses  changes in the economy interest rates the timing of tax payments and the company’s customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner among other items the company can provide no assurance that its customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future the company’s current liabilities may exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the periodic use of shortterm debt as a funding source primarily to meet scheduled maturities of longterm debt fund acquisitions and construction projects as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business the company addresses cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms 

presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the company’s cash flows provided by operating activities 





in 2019  cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 3 million  primarily due to the settlement of cash flow hedges and increased interest costs in connection with the company’s 110 billion debt offering that closed on may 13 2019 and an increase in pension contributions partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in net income the main factors contributing to the increase in net income are described in “consolidated results of operations” and “segment results of operations” above 

the company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of 38 million in 2020  in addition the company estimates that contributions will amount to 33 million  34 million  34 million and 32 million in 2021  2022  2023 and 2024  respectively actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns among other factors

cash flows from financing activities 

presented in the table below is a summary of the major items affecting the company’s cash flows provided by financing activities 



 in 2019 cash flows provided by financing activities decreased 232 million  primarily due to the issuance of common stock in 2018 the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the 2018 acquisition of pivotal as well as an increase in cash used for dividend payments in 2019 awcc issued 110 billion of longterm debt as part of its may 13 2019 debt offering of which 51 million of the net proceeds was used to repay longterm debt obligations at maturity net proceeds from the debt offering were also used to repay preexisting shortterm borrowings which resulted in a net cash outflow for 2019 of 178 million  

the company’s financing activities primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures regulated and marketbased acquisitions and payment of dividends these activities included the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc and in 2018 included an equity issuance for approximately 50 of the pivotal acquisition in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction net of refunds which amounted to 26 million  21 million and 28 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively based on the needs of the regulated businesses and the company awcc may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then through intercompany loans provide those borrowings to the regulated businesses and parent company the regulated businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated businesses  therefore parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates as of december 31 2019  awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the regulated businesses amounting to 48 billion and 675 million  respectively additionally as of december 31 2019  awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to parent company amounting 24 billion and 111 million  respectively as of december 31 2019  parent company has made longterm fixed rate loans to the marketbased businesses amounting to 183 million related to the acquisition of pivotal on june 4 2018

interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the libor rate or applicable market replacement rate or base rate in accordance with moody investors service’s and standard  poor’s financial services’ then applicable credit rating on awcc’s senior unsecured noncredit enhanced debt the facility is used principally to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 150 million in letters of credit indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between parent company and awcc which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by parent company of awcc’s payment obligations under the credit facility 

in march 2018 awcc increased the maximum aggregate outstanding amount under its commercial paper program from 160 billion to 210 billion  

presented in the table below is the aggregate credit facility commitments letter of credit sublimit under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper limit as well as the available capacity for each as of december 31 2019 and 2018  



the weighted average interest rate on awcc shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was approximately 254 and 228  respectively 

capital structure 

presented in the table below is the percentage of the company’s capitalization represented by the components of its capital structure as of december 31 



the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in longterm debt 

debt covenants 

the company’s debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that the company is not in compliance with these covenants an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and the company or its subsidiaries may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends issue new debt or access the revolving credit facility the longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things prohibit or restrict the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations 

covenants in certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization as defined in the relevant documents of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2019  the company’s ratio was 061 to 100 and therefore the company was in compliance with the covenants 

security ratings 

presented in the table below are longterm and shortterm credit ratings and rating outlooks as of february 18 2020 as issued by the following rating agencies 



on june 7 2019 standard  poor’s ratings service affirmed the company’s longterm ‘a’ and shortterm ‘a1’ credit ratings with a stable outlook 

on april 1 2019 moody’s investors service changed the company’s senior unsecured debt rating to baa1 from a3 with a stable outlook the company’s commercial paper rating remained unchanged 

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans the company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain its existing ratings none of the company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility 

as part of its normal course of business the company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit the company and its counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if the company is downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that the company must provide collateral to secure its obligations the company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets may be directly affected by the company’s securities ratings the company primarily accesses the debt capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however the company has also issued debt through its regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds to lower the overall cost of debt 

dividends and regulatory restrictions

insurance coverage 

the company carries various property casualty cyber and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims additionally annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a goingforward basis the company is selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company’s shortterm and longterm financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the company enters into contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business presented in the table below is information related to its contractual obligations as of december 31 2019

the company has entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the us military municipalities and other customers these obligations are not included in the table above for discussion of the company’s performance obligations see note 3—revenue recognition in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates assumptions and judgments that could affect the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates assumptions and judgments management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows as reflected in the company’s consolidated financial statements management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the company’s audit finance and risk committee including the estimates assumptions and judgments used in their application additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in note 2—significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulation and regulatory accounting 

the company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by pucs and as such the company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities which requires the company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its consolidated financial statements use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria i thirdparty regulation of rates ii costbased rates and iii a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service plus a return on net investment or rate base as of december 31 2019  the company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria 

application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on the company’s financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process the company makes significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities such judgments include but are not limited to assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions pension and postretirement benefits depreciation rates and taxes due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a nonregulated entity to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates conversely the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where the company conducts business the company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments recent rate orders including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pending or potential legislation if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement the company’s consolidated statements of operations and financial position could be materially affected in addition if the company concludes in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria the company is required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact the company’s consolidated financial statements 

on december 22 2017  the tcja was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the code including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as of january 1 2018 the tcja created significant excess deferred income taxes that the company and its regulatory jurisdictions believe should be refunded to customers as such the company recorded these amounts as regulatory liabilities 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the company’s regulatory asset balance was 11 billion and 12 billion  respectively and its regulatory liability balance was 18 billion and 19 billion  respectively see note 7—regulatory assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company’s significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the company’s regulated businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers these contracts contain a single performance obligation the delivery of water or wastewater services as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and therefore is not distinct revenues are recognized over time as services are provided there are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill to the end of the accounting period the amounts that the company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer 

increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue in addition changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation unbilled revenue for the company’s regulated utilities as of december 31 2019 and 2018 was 142 million and 144 million  respectively 

the company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process 

revenue from the company’s homeowner services group is generated through various protection programs in which the company provides fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and external water and sewer lines interior electric and gas lines heating and cooling systems water heaters power surge protection and other related services most of the contracts have a oneyear term and each service is a separate performance obligation satisfied over time as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service customers are obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a onetime annual fee with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services advances from customers are deferred until the performance obligation is satisfied 

the company also has longterm fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems for the us government on various military installations and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers and prior to the sale of keystone the company had shorterterm contracts that provided customized water transfer services for shale natural gas companies and customers billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the company additionally these contracts allow the company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract whereby standalone fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement the company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined unbilled revenue for the marketbased businesses as of december 31 2019 and 2018 was 30 million and 42 million  respectively 

accounting for income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and the utilization of nol carryforwards 

in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance the company accounts for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not morelikelythannot that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits no benefit is recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

the company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets the company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements the company records valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when it concludes that it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

under gaap specifically accounting standards codification topic 740 income taxes “asc 740” the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted asc 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled thus at the date of enactment of the tcja the company’s deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new tax rate for the company’s regulated entities the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to refund to customers for the company’s unregulated operations the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a noncash remeasurement adjustment to earnings 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for the regulated businesses  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2019 and 2018 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance however the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 14—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

the company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared service operations see note 15—employee benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

 the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices the company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 344  438 and 375 at december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 336  432 and 373 at december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively 

in selecting an eroa the company considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 620 for 2019  595 for 2018  and 649 for 2017  the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 356 for 2019  477 for 2018 and 509 for 2017  

presented in the table below are the allocations of the pension plan assets by asset category 



postretirement medical bargaining plan changes 

on july 31 2018  a new five year national benefits agreement was ratified covering approximately 3200 of the company’s unionrepresented employees most of the benefits under this new agreement became effective on january 1 2019 and include among other things unionrepresented employees’ participation in the company’s cashbased annual performance plan additional medical plan options and changes to certain retiree medical benefits which required the company to remeasure its other postretirement benefit plan obligation during the third quarter of 2018 

for those eligible union retirees and dependents over age 65 the current supplemental retiree medical plan will be replaced with a health reimbursement arrangement “hra” similar to the cap currently in place for nonunion retirees the company is providing a subsidy allowing the post65 retirees to purchase a medicare supplemental plan on a private exchange network the pre65 coverage plan was also amended to provide a cap on future employer costs designed to limit the employer costs to 2018 levels for pre65 union members retiring early in 20192021 a supplemental benefit will be provided to alleviate the effect of the cap 

on august 31 2018  the postretirement medical benefit plan was remeasured to reflect this plan change the plan change resulted in a 175 million reduction in future benefits payable to plan participants and in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement date resulted in a 227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation the plan amendment will be amortized over 102 years the average future working lifetime to full eligibility age for all plan participants 

after the remeasurement the retirement and benefit plans investment committee the “investment committee” which is responsible for overseeing the investment of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets determined that the funded status of the postretirement medical bargaining plan was in excess of that needed to pay current and future benefits 

given the change in funded status in 2018 the investment committee commissioned an assetliability study for the postretirement medical bargaining plan this study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the investment risk in the plan due to its current funded status the study also recommended reducing its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability the investment committee approved the recommendations plan assets in excess of those securities designed to match the longterm liabilities are invested in shorter duration fixed income securities and equities 

presented in the table below are the allocations of the other postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category 



  

 the investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through mutual funds commingled funds and limited partnerships the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase the company considers past experience in light of movements in inflation rates the company’s rate of compensation increase was 297 for 2019  300 for 2018 and 302 for 2017  

in selecting health care cost trend rates the company considers past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs as of january 1 2018 the company’s health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 675 in 2019 gradually declining to 500 in 2026 and thereafter as of december 31 2019  the company is projecting that medical inflation will be 650 in 2020 gradually declining to 500 in 2026 and thereafter 

the company will use a discount rate and eroa of 344 and 650  respectively for estimating its 2020 pension costs additionally the company will use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 336 and 368  respectively for estimating its 2020 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase the company’s pension expense the company’s 2019 and 2018 pension and postretirement benefit costs were 17 million and 21 million  respectively the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 38 million in 2020  and 33 million  34 million  34 million and 32 million in 2021  2022  2023 and 2024  respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards 

accounting for contingencies 

the company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated the determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter which may include an analysis of different scenarios liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible management considers many factors which include but are not limited to the nature of the litigation claim or assessment review of applicable law opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors and the experience gained from similar cases or situations the company provides disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred the company provides estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined either as a single amount or within a reasonable range 

actual amounts realized upon settlement or other resolution of loss contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements see note 16—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingencies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates the company is exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper the company manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates the company also has the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2019  a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with the company’s shortterm borrowings would result in a 7 million increase in shortterm interest expense 

the company’s risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of the company’s common stock may experience fluctuations which may be unrelated to its operating performance in particular the company’s stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for the company to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of its common stock or other equity securities regardless of its financial performance and such difficulty may preclude the company from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

the company is exposed to credit risk through its water wastewater and other waterrelated services provided by the regulated businesses and marketbased businesses  the company’s regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while the marketbased businesses engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers the company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances the company’s credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements the company’s credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition the regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities the company aims to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixedincome securities that have a duration similar to that of its pension liabilities seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of its liabilities that way if interest rates fall and liabilities increase the company expects that the fixedincome assets in its retirement trust will also increase in value the company also expects its risk to be reduced through its ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates 

the company is also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates the credit quality of the company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore the company’s ability to fully recover operating expense recover its investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in the regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

business 

tableend our company 

with a history dating back to 1886  american water is the largest and most geographically diverse publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the united states as measured by both operating revenues and population served a holding company originally incorporated in delaware in 1936  we employ approximately 7100  professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to more than 14 million  people in 46  states and ontario canada we conduct the majority of our business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services collectively presented as our “ regulated businesses ” we also operate marketbased businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water wastewater and other services individually these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and are collectively presented as our marketbased businesses  which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses 

throughout this form 10k unless the context otherwise requires references to “we” “us” “our” the “company” and “american water” mean american water works company inc and its subsidiaries taken together as a whole references to “parent company” mean american water works company inc without its subsidiaries 

regulated businesses      

our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial public authority fire service and sale for resale customers our utilities operate in approximately 1600  communities in 16  states in the united states with approximately 34 million  active customers to our water and wastewater networks services provided by our utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation collectively referred to as public utility commissions “pucs” or “regulators” certain federal state and local governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters we report the results of the services provided by our utilities in our regulated businesses  segment operating revenues for our regulated businesses  were 2984 million  for 2018  2958 million  for 2017  and 2871 million  for 2016  accounting for 87  88  and 87  respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods 

the following table provides a geographic summary of our regulated businesses ’ operating revenues and the number of customers we serve by type of service for and as of the year ended december 31 2018  



 see item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note 20—segment information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

customers 

our regulated businesses  have a large and geographically diverse customer base a customer is defined as a person business municipality or any other entity that purchases our water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period one single customer may purchase our services for use by multiple individuals or businesses as is the case in many homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities 

the vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water usage typically on a monthly basis we employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption these methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption 

residential customers make up a substantial portion of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate we also serve i commercial customers such as food and beverage providers commercial property developers and proprietors and energy suppliers ii fire service customers where we supply water through our distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities iii industrial customers such as largescale manufacturers mining and production operations iv public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools and universities and v other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers 

the following chart depicts the allocation of our regulated businesses ’ operating revenue by type including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer for the year ended december 31 2018  



the following table provides the number of water and wastewater customers we served by class as of december 31 



 customer growth in our regulated businesses  is primarily from i adding new customers to our customer base through acquisitions of water andor wastewater utility systems ii organic population growth in our authorized service areas and iii sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems 

capital investment 

the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in need of replacement and modernization the american society of civil engineers published its report card for america’s infrastructure in 2017 and gave the drinking water industry a grade of “d” and the wastewater infrastructure a grade of “d” primarily because much of the country’s infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life the report also stated that on an annual basis approximately 2 trillion  gallons of treated water are lost in the united states through more than 240000  main breaks at an estimated cost of 26 billion  this represents approximately 20  of all treated water in the country in addition approximately 900 billion  gallons of untreated sewage is discharged into the country’s rivers and streams every year as documented in the american water works association’s buried no longer confronting america’s water infrastructure challenge  restoring the country’s existing water systems as they reach the end of their useful lives and expanding them to serve a growing population will cost at least 1 trillion between 2011 and 2035 just to maintain the current levels of water service in addition increased regulation related to water quality and the management of water and wastewater residual discharges which began with the passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 is also a primary driver for the need to modernize the country’s water and wastewater infrastructure 

to address the growing infrastructure needs in the areas we serve we plan to invest 73 billion  over the next five years including 16 billion  in 2019 for capital improvements to our regulated businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities we have proactively improved our pipe renewal rate from a 250year replacement cycle to a 120year replacement cycle which we anticipate will enable us to replace nearly 2000 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2019 and 2023 in addition during this same fiveyear period our capital investment in treatment plants storage tanks and other key aboveground facilities has increased over 10 further addressing infrastructure renewal resiliency water quality operational efficiency technology and innovation and emerging regulatory compliance needs additionally we are investing significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening our assets 

economic regulation and rate making   

our regulated businesses  operate under a regulatory compact whereby in exchange for exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services in defined service territories we have an obligation to serve customers within those territories requesting service within reasonable limits in return for agreeing to invest capital into our water and wastewater systems we are given the opportunity to recover our costs of doing business and earn a reasonable rate of return on our investments 

the operations of our regulated businesses  are generally subject to economic regulation by pucs in the state in which they operate with the primary responsibility of the pucs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs review and approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital om expenses capital expenditures taxes affiliated transactions and relationships reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

the process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the puc on a periodic basis the timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions our rate case management program is guided by the principles of i obtaining timely recovery of capital investment costs ii recognizing declining sales resulting from reduced consumption and iii obtaining appropriate recovery of utility om costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the program attempts to minimize “regulatory lag” which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates for example regulatory lag describes the time between when a capital investment is placed into service for the benefit of the customer and when the company can begin earning a return of and on that capital investment through the ratemaking process it also applies to the lag in the recognition in rate recovery of changes in expenses and revenues 

our regulated businesses  support regulatory practices at the pucs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag the following table provides examples of approved regulatory practices 



we pursue or seek enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and capital investments in order to continue to provide safe clean reliable and affordable services to our customers the ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the pucs will accept our proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these regulatory practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

acquisitions and strategic growth 

the us water and wastewater industries include investorowned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions both industries are highly fragmented according to the us environmental protection agency “epa” approximately 84  of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98  of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned the epa also estimates that there are approximately 50000  community water systems and approximately 15000  community wastewater systems in the united states with approximately 80 of the community water systems serving a population of 3000  or less this large number of relatively small fragmented water and wastewater systems may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to their water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool or warm temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time larger utilities also typically have the expertise to operate systems more efficiently and can attract and retain employees needed to operate the utility over time 

a fundamental aspect of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water andor wastewater systems of between 3000 and 30000 customers in geographic proximity to areas where we operate our regulated businesses  the proximity of acquisition opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using our existing management although we typically retain the majority of employees and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs our current customer mix of 94  water and 6  wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation allowing us to add wastewater customers where we already serve water customers we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses  before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to our customers as well as a line of sight to grow our base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market 

increasingly stringent environmental health and safety and water quality regulations the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets 

we are an experienced utility with proven access to capital and financial technical and managerial resources with public service commission oversight we are a solution provider and believe that many communities could benefit from receiving safe and reliable water and wastewater service 

industry legislation 

in 2017 new jersey enacted the water quality accountability act the “wqaa” which sets new operational standards for all water utilities in new jersey including municipal and investorowned utilities with more than 500 service connections this law imposes new requirements in areas such as cybersecurity asset management water quality reporting remediation of notices of violation and hydrant and valve maintenance the wqaa requires the most senior water manager or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems to certify that the system meets the requirements under the wqaa on october 19 2018 our new jersey american water subsidiary certified that it was in compliance with all aspects of the act 

in 2018 similar legislation was passed in indiana which sets new operational standards and requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants in areas such as capital asset management costbenefit analysis and cybersecurity 

also in 2018 president trump signed america’s water infrastructure act of 2018 the legislation includes policies intended to improve water and wastewater system management and authorization for states to assess options for consolidation for systems that do not comply with the federal safe drinking water act and its rules and regulations the legislation increases funding to water system funding programs including the state revolving loan fund program and the water infrastructure finance and innovation act 

our regulated subsidiaries in california illinois indiana iowa maryland missouri new jersey and pennsylvania have access to fair market value legislation for private sector investment in public sector systems we support full optionality for municipalities including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through thirdparty fair market valuations of purchased property fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation providing municipalities with a purchase price that is reflective of the assets’ value while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over the life of the assets subject to state regulatory commission approval 

consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state as a result consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state overall this brings costeffective higher quality services to a larger number of citizens eleven of our regulated subsidiaries currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing including illinois indiana iowa kentucky maryland missouri new jersey new york pennsylvania virginia and west virginia 

in 2018 legislation was passed in our missouri and california subsidiaries changing the public vote requirement for the sale of water or wastewater systems in missouri the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than 500 small towns historically only larger communities required a simple majority while smaller communities needed a twothirds majority this legislation increases the options for small towns should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale in california the vote required to allow cities to sell sewer systems changed to a simple majority as compared to a twothirds majority 

competition 

in our regulated businesses  we generally do not face direct competition in our existing markets because i we operate in those markets pursuant to franchises charters certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations collectively “cpcns” issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a high barrier to market entry however our regulated businesses  do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions when pursuing acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc suez north america american states water company and california water service group from time to time we also face competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as algonquin power and utilities corp eversource energy and corix 

condemnation and eminent domain 

all or portions of our regulated businesses ’ utility assets could be acquired by state municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods i eminent domain also known as condemnation ii the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original cpcn was granted and iii the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its cpcn the acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular cpcn 

as such we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business for example a citizens group in monterey california successfully added “measure j” to the november 6 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the monterey peninsula water management district the “mpwmd” should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of our california subsidiary’s monterey water service assets and if feasible to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote this service territory represents approximately 40000 customers on november 27 2018 measure j was certified to have passed the mpwmd has until august 27 2019 to complete a feasibility study and submit to its board a written plan for acquiring the system assets if the mpwmd were to determine that such an acquisition is feasible then the mpwmd would commence a multiyear eminent domain proceeding against our california subsidiary to first establish the mpwmd’s right to take the system assets and if such right is established determine the amount of just compensation to be paid for the system assets 

also five municipalities in the chicago illinois area approximately 30300 customers in total formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our illinois subsidiary in january 2013 seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities before filing its eminent domain lawsuit the water agency made an offer of 38 million for the pipeline a jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline although the date of this trial has not currently been scheduled it is likely to commence in the fourth quarter of 2019 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our regulated businesses  operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently in california most recently lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property in some cases the puc has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed also the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance 

water supply and wastewater services 

our regulated businesses  generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to our customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multistate agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law we are dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from groundwater sources such as wells and aquifers and water purchased from thirdparty water suppliers the level of water treatment we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only 

the following chart depicts our sources of water supply as of december 31 2018  

the following table provides percentages of water supply by source type for our top seven states for 2018  were as follows 



our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate water supply drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water we employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service territory for example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas we serve may experience wetter than average weather 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate water supply we use longterm planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development an example of our use of longterm planning to ensure that we have adequate water supply is our involvement in the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” in california the water supply project includes the construction of a desalination plant owned by our california subsidiary and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant in addition the water supply project also includes our california subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project between the monterey regional water pollution control agency now known as monterey one water and the mpwmd the water supply project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of our california subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under orders of the california state water resources control board the “swrcb” for more information see item 3—legal proceedings —alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

seasonality 

customer demand for our water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and the frequency of rainfall customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use as such we typically expect our operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues whereas weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues three of our jurisdictions california illinois and new york have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit us to collect state pucauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period thereby lessening the impact of weather variability see “ economic regulation and rate making ” for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms 

marketbased businesses     

through our marketbased businesses  we provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers the us government on military installations and shale natural gas exploration and production companies as well as municipalities utilities and industrial customers these businesses are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment operating revenues for our marketbased businesses  were 476 million  for 2018  422 million  for 2017  and 451 million  for 2016  accounting for 14  13  and 14  respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods 

our primary marketbased businesses  include the following operating segments 

 we also enter into contracts with municipal commercial and industrial customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through our contract services group  during 2018 we closed on the sale of the majority of our contract services group ’s om contracts to subsidiaries of veolia environnement sa see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information we will retain four of our contract services group ’s om contracts due to their proximity to our existing service areas and expect the majority of the remaining contracts to be sold to other parties or expire within the next twelve months 

homeowner services group   

our homeowner services group  which includes our june 4 2018  acquisition of pivotal home solutions “pivotal” provides warranty protection programs to residential and smaller commercial customers to protect against repair costs for interior and exterior water and sewer lines interior gas and electric lines heating and cooling systems water heaters and other home appliances as well as power surge protection and other related services we also develop partnerships with municipalities utilities and other organizations to offer our protection programs to customers serviced by or affiliated with those municipalities utilities and organizations the term of these partnership agreements is typically three to five years with mutual optional renewals as of december 31 2018  our homeowner services group  had approximately 3 million  customer contracts in 43  states and 26  partnership agreements with utilities municipalities and other organizations 

military services group   

our military services group  operates on 14  military installations under 50year contracts with the us government as part of its utility privatization program the scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and in certain instances systems expansion the replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the company is funded from the contract fee at times new assets are required to support the installation’s mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the us government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract the capital program historically has not used the company’s equity or debt borrowings rather we have used limited working capital for shortterm needs under these contracts in april 2018 the us army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for a new capital project the company is currently exploring strategies to address the us army’s revised requirements for new projects on which it may seek to bid including partnering with third parties for offbalance sheet financing 

the contract price for   nine  of our contracts with the us government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions the remaining five  contracts with the us government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called “economic price adjustment” all of these contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to these contracts we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs our backlog of revenue associated with our contracts with the us government is approximately 43 billion  with an average remaining contract term of 42  years 

keystone 

in july 2015 we acquired a 95  interest in water solutions holdings llc including its wholly owned subsidiary keystone during 2018 pursuant to the exercise of put options by the minority owners we acquired the remaining 5  interest in keystone bringing our ownership interest to 100  keystone is a water service and management solutions company that serves shale natural gas exploration and production customers in the appalachian basin during 2018 keystone exited its construction and water trucking business lines narrowing the scope of its business going forward to customized water transfer services keystone operates under master service agreements that are generally shorter term in nature when the initial term of these agreements expire they typically renew automatically on an annual basis and are generally cancelable by either party with 30 days prior notice as of december 31 2018  keystone serves approximately 47  customers 

competition 

we face competition in our marketbased businesses  from a number of service providers including homeserve usa in our homeowner services group  and american states water company suez north america and veolia environnement sa in our military services group  keystone currently faces competition from water service providers that typically provide services to particular segments of the water management cycle such as select energy services inc tetra technologies inc and baker corp 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both our regulated businesses  and marketbased businesses  are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we deliver to our customers and the manner in which we collect treat discharge recycle and dispose of wastewater in the united states these regulations are developed under legislation including the safe drinking water act the reduction of lead in drinking water act and the clean water act states also have the authority to develop their standards and requirements in these areas we are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently for example while the epa has issued a nonenforceable health advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds the new jersey department of environmental protection has adopted a more stringent maximum contaminant level for a third compound perfluorononanoic acid or pfna and perfluorooctanoic acid or pfoa and will be seeking to adopt similar standards for other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances or pfas the overall trend has been that drinking water standards have become increasingly more stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could increase we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental health and safety and water quality standards to which our operations are subject and we invest in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring in the past our regulated businesses  have generally been able to recover the costs associated with compliance however this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery we estimate that we will make capital expenditures of 133 million  and 120 million  during 2019  and 2020  respectively for environmental control facilities which we define for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land we also maintain an environmental program that includes responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations and effective use of natural resources we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” authorizes the epa and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under cercla or comparable state laws although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the us occupational safety and health act and inspections thereunder certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters see item 3—legal proceedings  for additional information 

safe drinking water act 

the safe drinking water act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements to date the epa has set standards for approximately 90  contaminants and indicators for drinking water and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years 

to help formulate the basis for future regulations the epa has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule the “monitoring rule” our facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the monitoring rule in previous rounds which occurs every five years and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2020 there are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology the process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex but we actively participate with the epa and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge see item 1—business—research and development—emerging containments for additional information 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in 2006 the epa issued the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule and finalized the ground water rule which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources in 2016 the revised total coliform rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects we are within the epa’s time frame for compliance with these standards which includes sample collection data analysis engineering planning and system implementation recent monitoring under the longterm 2 rule has resulted in the need for more than 30  of our surface water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium in most cases this will involve installing uv disinfection at an estimated cost ranging from 150 million  to 250 million  further the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds we do not anticipate that any such regulations if enacted will require implementation in 2019 

across the company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water we participate in the partnership for safe water the epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 69  of our 81  surface water treatment plants receiving the epa program’s prestigious “director” award which recognizes utilities that i have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report ii created an action plan for continuous improvement and iii produced highquality drinking water we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 67  of our surface water treatment plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award 62  plants have received the “tenyear phase iii” award 58  plants have received the “fifteenyear phase iii” award and 3  plants have received the “twentyyear phase iii” award these awards recognize plants that have met the director award status for five 10 15 and 20 years respectively further nine  of our surface water plants have received the “presidents” award which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

lead and copper rule and reduction of lead in drinking water act 

across the country there is a renewed focus on the potential risk of lead in drinking water in 1991 the epa published the lead and copper rule “lcr” to control lead and copper in drinking water and since that time has issued minor revisions in 2000 2004 and 2007 enhancing monitoring reporting and public education requirements in 2011 congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings for fixtures solder and flux while these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water legacy lead plumbing materials primarily in building plumbing still remain in many communities the epa is currently working to develop longterm revisions to the lcr with a revised draft likely in 2019 it is currently estimated that approximately 5 of our service lines contain lead “lsls” we have reviewed our inventories of company owned service lines our related practices and are working with stakeholders to develop feasible solutions to remove legacy lead from service lines in older neighborhoods our goal is to replace our lsls in most areas over an approximate 10year time frame at an estimated cost ranging from 600 million  to 12 billion  in cases where we are replacing an american water owned lsl our standard approach will be to replace the companyowned portion of the service line and work with the customer to replace the customerowned portion of the service line at the same time replacing the full service line is considered a best practice as advised by the lead service line replacement collaborative and the american water works association the lead service line replacement collaborative is a diverse group of public health water utility environmental labor consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of lsls through collaborative efforts at the local level the prioritization of this work will depend on several factors including our planned water main and service line renewal projects adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities lcr compliance monitoring results and cooperation with our customers with respect to the customerowned portion of the service line there is also a special focus placed on lowincome neighborhoods 

clean water act 

the clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act which must be renewed every five years pursuant to the npdes permit program the epa and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems discharges that exceed the limits specified under npdes permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and persistent noncompliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs in addition the difficulty of obtaining and complying with npdes permits and renewing expiring permits may impose time and cost burdens on our operations from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

environmental social responsibility and governance 

integrating environmental social responsibility and governance “esg” policies and practices into our daily operations emphasizes our belief that the only way to do business is to do it responsibly and that the “how” is just as important as the “what” for longterm financial sustainability being committed to esg principles means striving to 

 this focus is derived from our vision statement “clean water for life” and our core values i safety ii trust iii environmental leadership iv teamwork and v high performance the principles by which we work and live our vision and values drive our company strategy which is centered on five central themes 

 in 2017 we issued our fourth biennial corporate responsibility report covering our performance in 2015 to 2016 our first report was issued in 2011 making us the first large water services company to measure its performance against the global reporting index in addition our sustainability practices have supported our inclusion in the euronext vigeo ®  us 50 index ftse4good index series 2018 constituent msci esg leaders indexes naacp equity inclusion and empowerment index and the most recent 2019 bloomberg genderequality index highlights of our commitment to our esg policies and practices are summarized below

we continue to leverage the company’s expertise and collaborate with the epa and state agencies to help establish effective environmental health and safety and water quality standards and regulation this relationship includes the sharing of our research such as our treatment and distribution system optimization research and our national water quality monitoring data our engagement with the epa provides us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements we also frequently engage with the centers for disease control and other state environmental agencies we believe that continued rd activities are critical for providing safe reliable and affordable services as well as maintaining our leadership position in the industry which provides us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

emerging contaminants 

emerging contaminants include chemicals such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides herbicides and endocrine disrupting compounds as well as some naturally occurring microbes such as bacteria viruses and parasites which have been detected in drinking water supplies for which the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood andor has not been quantified while these contaminants have been present in our drinking water for as long as they have been in use technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them the ability to detect contaminants even at trace levels has raised questions among regulators and government agencies further affecting the public’s perception of drinking water quality 

the chemicals abstract service registry contains over 140 million registered chemicals with a new substance being produced approximately every 3 seconds from chemical breakdown and reformation there are over 1400 microbes which can affect drinking water we are continually investigating new substances and contaminants employing a team of scientists engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to our water supply to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies we maintain stateoftheart water quality testing equipment and implement new and emerging technologies to help predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues examples of our efforts include

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business operations 

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation by state pucs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our utility operations also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these regulatory requirements 

our regulated businesses  provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to economic regulation by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to 

 approval of the pucs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations some state pucs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations our utilities are also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the pucs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business 

in any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the level estimated in establishing rates 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations including with respect to emerging contaminants compliance with which could impact our operating costs and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs as well as damage to our reputation 

our regulated water and wastewater operations and the operations of our marketbased businesses  are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include cercla the clean water act and the safe drinking water act epa requirements and similar federal state and canadian laws and regulations for example cercla authorizes the epa to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations 

in addition state pucs and environmental regulators also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our regulated businesses through customer rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses  would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

attention is being given to emerging contaminants including without limitation chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances examples of sources of emerging contaminants include but are not limited to newly created chemical compounds including for example manufactured nanomaterials human and veterinary products perfluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds including pfna pfoa and other pfas bacteria microbes viruses amoebae and other pathogens and residual byproducts of disinfection we rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants and our role is to provide service that meets these standards if any in some of our states pucs may disapprove of cost recovery in whole or in part for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard furthermore given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created andor discovered we may not be able to detect andor mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation in addition we believe emerging contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future which could significantly increase the cost of our operations 

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time and vary by state or region may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water 

for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 20 2009 cease and desist order the “2009 order” as amended by an order in july 2016 the “2016 order” of the swrcb that requires californiaamerican water company our wholly owned subsidiary “cal am” to significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on december 31 2021 the “2021 deadline” we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act we cannot predict whether cal am will be able to secure alternative sources of water or if cal am will be exposed to liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2021 deadline under the 2009 order and the 2016 order if cal am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected see item 3—legal proceedings —alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions which includes additional information regarding this matter 

the current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay also known as “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business 

there is typically a delay known as “regulatory lag” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory policies for example three of our states have approved revenue stability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless of sales volume including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently in addition ten of our state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates furthermore in setting rates ten of our state pucs allow us to use future test years which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the general rate case application process 

while these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs furthermore pucs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form or at all although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected 

changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions including without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax laws can materially affect our operations results of operations and cash flows the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others 



any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

in addition new federal state and local laws changes in existing laws rules or regulations or administrative interpretations thereof could impact us on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as of january 1 2018 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including continuation of interest expense deductibility the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income taxes the enactment of the tcja required remeasurement of our deferred income taxes which materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position and had a lesser impact on our 2018 results of operations and financial position during 2018 all of our 14 jurisdictions subject to economic regulation opened formal proceedings related to the tcja and proceedings presently remain open in three  of them further the regulatory treatment of the remeasured deferred income taxes remains open in a number of these jurisdictions at this time we cannot predict the impacts on us of the regulatory treatment of the tcja in these open proceedings or matters or of the enactment or adoption of any related interpretations if and when issued moreover we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts if any of any other new or amended laws rules or regulations or interpretations thereof to the extent they may be ultimately enacted adopted or issued on us or our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service interruptions due to severe weather climate variability patterns and other natural events are possible across all our businesses these include among other things storms freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes landslides drought wildfires coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains severe electrical storms and solar flares weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our regulated businesses may not provide reimbursement to us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system as examples drought conditions had persisted in california over a fiveyear period and had been declared in new jersey in 2016 in 2017 these droughts were declared concluded but other droughts that may occur from time to time may result in the imposition of voluntary or mandatory water use targets rationing restrictions water conservation regulations and requirements to minimize water system leaks while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant puc determines they were reasonable and prudent we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will in fact be fully recovered moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise 

the issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention nationally and worldwide some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability many climate variability predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities such as 



 because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our regulated businesses could be recovered through rates infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms there can be no assurance that state pucs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs in whole or in part 

a loss of one or more large industrial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our regulated businesses 

adverse economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations tariffs in place with respect to our regulated businesses may not reimburse us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

our regulated businesses  require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment and to improve aging infrastructure in 2018  we invested 15 billion  in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will continue into the future and may increase we expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt we may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper longterm debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all if we are not able to obtain sufficient financing we could be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues 

the volume of water we sell during the warmer months typically in the summer is generally greater than during other months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

three of our jurisdictions california illinois and new york have adopted revenue stability mechanisms that permit us to collect state pucauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recover the fixed cost of operations while supporting water conservation goals in those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks if collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions damage to our reputation and private litigation 

the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system or the water service that is provided to our customers may be subject to contamination including among other items contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate methyl tertiary butyl ether lead and other materials chemical spills or other accidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks in addition new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water industry if one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 continuing limited use of the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply if service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new sources of supply or new treatment methods we may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance customer rates tariffs or contract terms any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies 

since we engage in the business of providing water service to our customers contamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur and we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water or water supplies in addition insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses and are subject to deductibles and other limitations pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations as well as the operations of our marketbased businesses  our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make generally our insurance policies cover property damage worker’s compensation employer’s liability general liability cybersecurity terrorism risks and automobile liability each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims as a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to obtain insurance coverage related to our business there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles 

we are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or sanctions 

water and wastewater utilities including our regulated subsidiaries and our marketbased businesses  have a large direct and indirect customer base and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of their water wastewater and related or ancillary services the quality of water provided and the amount timeliness accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies state pucs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative regulatory and economic outcomes as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our marketbased businesses  as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

new york american water company inc “nyaw” has been the subject of a new york state public service commission “nyspsc” investigation related to the unintentional provision of incorrect data to a taxing authority that resulted in an overassessment of real property taxes nyaw selfreported this issue to the nyspsc promptly after nyaw’s senior leadership became aware of it neither nyaw nor any of its employees received any financial benefit as a result of this matter as all customer overpayments were provided to the local taxing authorities the nyspsc investigation also related to the failure of a few employees working on nyaw’s 2016 general rate case to properly disclose these issues in that rate case on september 11 2018 the supreme court of the state of new york albany county approved a settlement of these matters and nyaw is cooperating with the nysdps to implement its terms as part of the settlement nyaw agreed that it would provide up to 45 million to benefit nyaw customers through several different mechanisms which amounts would not be recoverable in rates nyaw also agreed to accelerate the timing of the payment of approximately 64 million in aggregate customer credits finally nyaw agreed to engage and cooperate with an independent monitor through september 30 2021 while the settlement resolves the nyspsc’s investigation involving nyaw and those matters set forth above there can be no assurance that nyaw will not be subject to additional federal state or local proceedings regarding these and other related matters and these proceedings could result in increased oversight and civil administrative andor criminal sanctions which may have a material adverse effect upon our reputation and perception 

unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes also may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our marketbased businesses as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

the properties of our regulated businesses  segment include 80  dams the majority of which are earthen dams and the failure of any of which could result in personal injury and property damage including without limitation downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs although in most cases the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future the inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries property and other damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments 

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems which involves risks including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business 

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we may not be able to acquire other systems or businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 

the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired systems or businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in among other things 

 some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business the systems and businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability or other perceived synergies and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions 

our regulated businesses  are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses  operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process if a municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group seeks to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition we may resist the acquisition 

for example on november 27 2018 monterey california ballot measure j was certified as having been approved by a public vote requiring the mpwmd to conduct a feasibility study and submit a written plan concerning the feasibility of a potential purchase of our california subsidiary’s monterey water service assets without an additional public vote also five municipalities in the chicago illinois area formed a water agency that filed an eminent domain lawsuit against our illinois subsidiary in january 2013 seeking to condemn a water pipeline that serves those five municipalities see item 1—business—regulated businesses—condemnation and eminent domain  which includes additional information regarding these matters 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our regulated businesses  operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently in california most recently lawsuits have been filed in connection with largescale natural events such as wildfires some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property in some cases the puc has disallowed recovery in rates of losses incurred by these utilities as a result of such lawsuits 

contesting an exercise of condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation eminent domain or other process may not be successful which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses  through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity 

we rely on technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our technology systems are an integral part of our business and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations for example we depend on these systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage certain plant operations and construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources supply chain inventory and accounts receivable collections 

although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure than other similar organizations our technology systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer employee or financial data security breaches misappropriation of property and other adverse consequences in addition a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency any or all of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be subject to physical andor cyber attacks 

as operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical andor cyber attacks from internal or external sources our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber attacks acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes our operational technology and it systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized external or internal access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties further third parties including vendors suppliers and contractors who perform certain services for us or administer and maintain our sensitive information could also be targets of cyber attacks and unauthorized access while we have instituted safeguards to protect our operational technology and it systems those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities we cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack 

if despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred our operations could be disrupted property damaged and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss suffer a loss of management time attention and resources from our regular business operations and be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows experiencing a cyber security incident could also cause us to be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations or contracts that require us to securely maintain confidential data causing us to incur costs related to legal claims or proceedings and regulatory fines or penalties these types of events either impacting our facilities or the industry in general could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs 

in addition in the ordinary course of business we collect and retain sensitive information including personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in many cases we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks any theft loss andor fraudulent use of customer employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation liability and costs as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators among others 

we have obtained cyber insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach of our it systems but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss or damage caused by a breach the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events may evolve as the industry matures in the future adequate insurance may not be available at rates that we believe are reasonable and the costs of responding to and recovering from a cyber incident may not be covered by insurance or recoverable in rates 

our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational technology and it systems or implement new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks or the implementation of new systems may require substantial amounts of management’s time and financial resources to complete and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors including employees’ ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system we continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions and have installed new and upgraded existing technology systems these efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations and enhance our customer service capabilities any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting we may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls business and operations we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated and any such impacts could harm our business individually or collectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our business has inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life and be exposed to financial losses including penalties and other liabilities 

our safety record is critical to our reputation we maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers contractors vendors and the public although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries it is extremely difficult to avoid all accidents or other safety incidents at all times 

our business sites including construction and maintenance sites often put our employees contractors and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment moving vehicles pressurized water underground trenches and vaults chemicals and other regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others our employees contractors and others may be injured or die unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our operations can involve the delivery handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly delivered handled stored or disposed of could result in serious injury death or property damage and could subject us to penalties or other liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

as of december 31 2018  approximately 49  of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 70  collective bargaining agreements in place with 15  different unions representing our unionized employees these collective bargaining agreements including 20  which expired in 2018  and 18  which will expire during 2019  are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation we may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that are fair to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers licensed operators water quality and other operating and craft personnel and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

financial and marketrelated risks 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2018  our aggregate longterm and shortterm debt balance including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 86 billion  and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new shortterm and longterm debt securities moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2019  2020  and 2021  will be 72 million  32 million  and 303 million  respectively we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all moreover if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

in an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt we have entered into and in the future may enter into financial derivative instruments including without limitation interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  however these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we will depend primarily on cash flows from operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative including tax initiatives and reforms and other similar legislation or regulation regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 

our inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external sources of shortterm liquidity are our 210 billion  commercial paper program and our 225 billion  revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility expires in accordance with its terms in march 2023 we regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2018  american water capital corp “awcc” our wholly owned financing subsidiary had no  outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had 954 million  of commercial paper outstanding and 81 million  in outstanding letters of credit there can be no assurance that awcc will be able to continue to access its commercial paper program or its revolving credit facility when as and if desired or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable or any cost 

under the terms of our revolving credit facility our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70 of our consolidated capitalization as determined under the terms of the credit facility if our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable to avoid such a default a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility 

our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties including events beyond our control for example events that could cause a reduction in equity include without limitation a significant writedown of our goodwill even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our shareholders to complete 

disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all on january 2018 moody’s investors service changed its rating outlook from stable to negative for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies including us while the lending banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments these or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or debt markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity longerterm disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty including as a result of changes in us tax and other laws reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital debt or credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures 

any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

american water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to american water 

american water is a holding company and as such american water has no substantive operations of its own substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries american water’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends to american water or repay indebtedness to american water prior to paying dividends to american water american water’s regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and covenants and other agreements made or entered into by american water and its subsidiaries american water’s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends to american water a failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on american water’s liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations 

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2018  we had us federal and state nol carryforwards of approximately 707 million  and 547 million  respectively and management believes it is more likely than not that these nol carryforwards will be recovered in the future with the enactment of the tcja the company analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities including its nol carryforwards and as a result remeasured those nol carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the tcja based on this tax rate change 

our federal nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028  and our state nol carryforwards began to expire in 2019 and will continue to expire through 2037 we expect to fully utilize our federal nol balance before it expires and our ability to do so is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our state nol carryforwards and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income 

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover adoption of related interpretations with respect to the tcja and other changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of our nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include 16 billion  of goodwill at december 31 2018  the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 the acquisition of pivotal in 2018 and to a lesser extent the acquisition of keystone in 2015 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business these market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or with respect to keystone fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the marcellus and utica shale regions served by keystone a prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our current or future forecasts of operating results cash flows or key assumptions in this regard in the third quarter of 2018 we strategically narrowed the scope of the keystone business solely to water transfer services due to operational and financial challenges in the other businesses of keystone as a result of this strategic change we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of 57 million  in the third quarter of 2018 related to keystone see note 8—goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization the effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators 

market conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the sec the financial accounting standards board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies these changes are beyond our control can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure 

our internal controls accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap taxation requirements federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us such compliance permits us to among other things disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities tax and other laws and regulations 

we have implemented corporate governance internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” and relevant sec rules as well as other applicable regulations such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and board of directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws rules and regulations management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls while we believe these controls policies practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting the consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition the inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also increase financing costs or could also adversely affect our or awcc’s ability to access the capital markets 

additional risks related to our marketbased businesses   

we excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our marketbased businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased businesses  do not satisfy these obligations 

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits primarily related to military service group in the event our marketbased businesses  fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

at december 31 2018  we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 43 billion  related to our military services group contracts and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased businesses  expand the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 

our marketbased businesses’ operations under our military services group are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the us government 

we enter into contracts with the us government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems which contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

moreover entering into contracts with the us government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations we are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which are complex and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the us government or our existing contracts could be terminated which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

our marketbased businesses under the contract services group operate a limited number of water and wastewater systems under longterm om contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems which may negatively affect the contract services group as the operator of the systems and we may incur costs in excess of payments received 

the contract services group operates a limited number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts the contract services group operates the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements in some cases the contract services group may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on the contract services group as the operator of the system and us and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to us to the same extent as if we were the owner 

in addition the contract services group has entered into longterm contracts under which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee the contract services group is generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

keystone’s operations may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters 

keystone’s operations and the operation generally of natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities by keystone’s customers are subject to stringent federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection these provisions may require the acquisition by keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers prohibit the release of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may result from these operations failure to comply with these laws rules regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs to keystone the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities under existing environmental laws and regulations keystone could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed while we have structured and maintained our ownership and control of keystone’s operations in such a way that we believe should insulate the company its regulated subsidiaries and its other marketbased businesses  from any liabilities associated with keystone’s operations including liabilities for environmental matters there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the company from incurring liability for the operations of keystone 

changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes to these or other laws governing the natural gas and oil exploration industry that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could require keystone to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance with such requirements may harm keystone’s business and results of operations by reducing the demand for keystone’s water and related services and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on keystone’s competitive position financial condition results of operations and cash flows

legal proceedings 

tableend alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

compliance with swrcb orders to reduce carmel river diversions 

under the 2009 order cal am is required among other things to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule the 2009 order responded to claims that cal am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the carmel river as required by a 1995 order of the swrcb in july 2016 at the request of cal am and several monterey county government agencies the swrcb issued the 2016 order approving a fiveyear extension of the deadline to comply with the 2009 order to december 31 2021 

the 2009 order includes a condition prohibiting cal am from diverting water from the carmel river for new service connections or for any increased use of water at existing service addresses resulting from a change in zoning or use in 2011 the california public utilities commission the “cpuc” issued a decision directing modifications in cal am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 order and directing cal am to seek written guidance from the swrcb with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition in 2012 the deputy director of the swrcb sent a letter to cal am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses on march 19 2018 the mpwmd adopted a resolution directing cal am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the swrcb’s written interpretation on may 4 2018 cal am notified the mpwmd and the swrcb that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 order in an attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention cal am met with the mpwmd and the swrcb several times the swrcb has circulated revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter which are being reviewed and discussed by the parties any failure to follow the mpwmd’s resolution or the swrcb’s written interpretation despite these conflicting interpretations could potentially result in fines penalties and other actions against cal am 

the 2016 order provides that if the cpuc authorizes cal am to acquire more than 1000 acrefeet per year of water from a source other than the water supply project proponents of the alternative water source could submit revised milestones to the swrcb for consideration on may 8 2018 certain parties to the water supply project proceeding submitted a petition to the swrcb to add parallel milestones to the 2009 order for 2019 2020 and 2021 based on the proposed expansion of the pure water monterey project another groundwater replenishment project under construction on the monterey peninsula petitioners claim that compliance with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of cal am’s unauthorized diversions from the carmel river by 2021 a preliminary report on feasibility concluded that the expanded pure water monterey project could provide an additional 2250 acrefeet of water per year cal am believes that i the petition is premature ii the expanded pure water monterey project is not yet a sufficiently certain or reliable water supply and even if construction is successfully completed would provide an insufficient quantity of water to allow full compliance with the 2009 order and iii the imposition of parallel milestones would distract from completion of the water supply project this petition remains pending 

regional desalination project litigation 

review of cpucapproved settlement agreement 

the regional desalination project the “rdp” involved the construction of a desalination facility in the city of marina north of monterey the rdp was intended to among other things eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under the 2009 order in december 2010 the cpuc approved the rdp which was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cal am in 2011 due to a conflict of interest concerning a former member of mcwra’s board of directors mcwra stated that the agreements were void and as a result cal am terminated the agreements in april 2015 the cpuc approved a settlement agreement among cal am mcwra and the county of monterey to resolve these matters among the parties signing the agreement in march 2016 the supreme court of california granted mcwd’s petition for review of the cpuc approval and following the court’s disposition of a related issue in another case mcwd’s petition for review of the cpucapproved settlement agreement was remanded to the cpuc and remains pending 

cal am’s action for damages following rdp termination 

in october 2012 cal am filed a complaint for declaratory relief against mcwra and mcwd which was ultimately transferred to the san francisco county superior court seeking a determination as to whether the agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest in june 2015 the court entered a final judgment agreeing with cal am’s position that four of the five agreements are void and one the credit line agreement is not void in november 2016 the supreme court of california denied mcwd’s final appeal of this judgment which allows further proceedings discussed below to determine the amount of damages that may be awarded in the proceeding 

in july 2015 cal am and mcwra filed a complaint in san francisco county superior court against mcwd and rmc water and environment “rmc” a private engineering consulting firm seeking to recover compensatory damages in excess of 10 million associated with the failure of the rdp as well as punitive and treble damages statutory penalties and attorneys’ fees shortly thereafter complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court by mcwd and rmc against cal am and mcwra in excess of 19 million in the aggregate in december 2015 the court consolidated all of these complaints into a single action trial in the consolidated action currently remains set for march 25 2019 in san francisco county superior court 

monterey peninsula water supply project 

cpuc final approval of water supply project 

the water supply project is intended to reduce water diversions from the carmel river and involves construction of a desalination plant owned by cal am and purchase of water by cal am from a groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” between the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the mpwmd cal am’s ability to move forward on the water supply project is and has been subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc and other government agencies obtaining necessary permits and intervention from other parties in september 2016 the cpuc unanimously approved a decision to authorize cal am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the gwr project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to 50 million in associated costs subject to meeting certain criteria if construction costs exceed 50 million cal am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery 

on august 13 2018 the cpuc issued its proposed decision granting cal am’s request for a cpcn for a 64 million gallons per day desalination plant certifying the final environmental impact reportenvironmental impact statement “eireis” and denying all other outstanding motions on september 13 2018 the cpuc unanimously adopted a final decision i finding that the water supply project meets the cpuc’s requirements for a cpcn and ii finding that a the issuance of the final decision should not be delayed and b an additional procedural phase was not necessary to consider alternative projects the cpuc’s decision directs cal am to enter into negotiations regarding expansion of the gwr project between the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the mpwmd and to indicate whether cal am plans to file an application for approval of an agreement to purchase additional water from the gwr project the decision notes however that the cpuc will only consider such an application if the water supply project is delayed such that cal am would not be able to meet the december 31 2021 deadline to comply with the 2009 order the decision accepts cal am’s estimates of future water demand in monterey and concludes that the water supply project is the best project to address those needs and adopts cal am’s most recent cost estimates the decision also allows cal am to earn an allowance for funds used during construction or afudc at a rate representative of its actual financing costs the final decision adopted frameworks as to cost caps om costs financing ratemaking and contingency matters 

in addition the cpuc final decision imposes numerous reporting and filing requirements to ensure the expenditures for the water supply project are reasonable including that the financing is the lowest cost and most beneficial for ratepayers and that construction is progressing in a timely manner and within the authorized cost caps the reasonableness of water supply project costs will be reviewed in the first general rate case filed by cal am after the water supply project becomes operational cal am is also required to implement mitigation measures to avoid minimize or offset significant environmental impacts from the construction and operation of the water supply project and comply with a mitigation monitoring and reporting program a reimbursement agreement for cpuc costs associated with that program and reporting requirements on plant operations following placement of the water supply project in service consistent with that decision on december 31 2018 cal am sought adjustments to certain financing and ratemaking provisions including the timing and amount of surcharge recovery and addressed related implementation issues 

on october 19 2018 mcwd and the city of marina filed applications for rehearing before the cpuc cal am filed its response to the applications for rehearing on november 5 2018 on january 31 2019 the cpuc denied these applications for rehearing 

on october 12 2018 mcwd and the city of marina filed petitions for writ of review in the supreme court of california challenging the sufficiency of the final eireis on december 12 2018 the supreme court of california denied the petitions for writ of review without prejudice to the filing of renewed submissions upon completion of the rehearing proceedings pending before the cpuc the city of marina and mcwd filed their renewed petitions for writ of review on january 16 2019 and january 17 2019 respectively 

coastal development permit application 

on june 22 2018 cal am submitted a coastal development permit application to the city of marina for those project components of the water supply project located within the city of marina’s coastal zone members of the city’s planning commission as well as city councilpersons have publicly expressed opposition to the water supply project on august 9 2018 the city deemed cal am’s application incomplete pending certification and submission of the final environmental impact report and stated that the city could not rule on the permit until certification as noted above the cpuc certified the final eireis for the water supply project on september 13 2018 a public hearing before the planning commission on cal am’s application was held on february 14 2019 and the planning commission voted to direct staff to prepare findings supporting a denial of the application the planning commission continued the hearing until march 7 2019 at which time it is expected to take formal action on the application 

proposed zoning changes at cemex site for slant wells 

on august 30 2018 the city circulated a public review draft of proposed amendments to its local coastal program and zoning ordinance and placed the matter for consideration on the planning commission’s agenda for its september 13 2018 meeting the proposed amendments would change zoning at the cemex site to open space and restrict future uses including with respect to cal am’s planned use of the site for the slant wells for the water supply project any change to the citys local coastal program must ultimately be approved by the california coastal commission the “coastal commission” cal am cemex and the coastal commission each submitted letters opposing the proposed amendments at its november 8 2018 meeting the planning commission adopted a resolution recommending that the marina city council consider approving the amendments 

on december 4 2018 the marina city council considered the proposed amendments cal am cemex and the coastal commission again submitted letters opposing the proposed changes but the city council unanimously adopted a resolution amending its local coastal plan and a draft amendment to its zoning ordinance changes to the ordinance require a second reading before becoming final which occurred at the city’s december 18 2018 meeting the changes to the local coastal plan must be submitted to the coastal commission for approval and are not effective until such approval is obtained 

test slant well permitting 

a preliminary step to building the water supply project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under monterey bay in november 2014 the coastal commission approved coastal development permits for the test slant well enabling cal am to construct and operate the test slant well the coastal commission has approved permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain and place and be maintained until february 28 2020 a required lease obtained from the california state lands commission as amended will expire on december 16 2019 effective february 28 2018 test slant well pumping ceased except for minimal maintenance pumping activities in accordance with cal am’s coastal development permits 

in november 2015 mcwd filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in santa cruz county superior court against the coastal commission and cal am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test well pumping in orders issued in september 2016 and october 2017 the court denied mcwd’s challenges on january 12 2018 mcwd filed a notice of appeal of the court’s judgment on march 13 2018 cal am filed a motion to dismiss mcwd’s appeal which was denied on june 25 2018 the appeal remains pending 

in july 2017 the coastal commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property on which intake wells will be located to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a nonprofit or governmental entity the consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves cal am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record 

based on all of the foregoing cal am estimates that the earliest date by which the water supply project desalination plant could be completed is sometime in 2021 there can be no assurance that the water supply project will be completed on a timely basis if ever furthermore there can be no assurance that cal am will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order and the 2016 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to cal am or the company

dunbar west virginia water main break class action litigation 

on the evening of june 23 2015 a 36inch prestressed concrete transmission water main installed in the early 1970s failed the water main is part of wvawc’s west relay pumping station located in the city of dunbar the failure of the main caused water outages and low pressure to up to approximately 25000 wvawc customers in the early morning hours of june 25 2015 crews completed a repair but that same day the repair developed a leak on june 26 2015 a second repair was completed and service was restored that day to approximately 80 of the impacted customers and to the remaining approximately 20 by the next morning the second repair showed signs of leaking but the water main was usable until june 29 2015 to allow tanks to refill the system was reconfigured to maintain service to all but approximately 3000 customers while a final repair was completed safely on june 30 2015 water service was fully restored on july 1 2015 to all customers affected by this event 

on june 2 2017 a class action complaint was filed in west virginia circuit court in kanawha county against wvawc on behalf of a purported class of residents and business owners who lost water service or pressure as a result of the dunbar main break the complaint alleges breach of contract by wvawc for failure to supply water violation of west virginia law regarding the sufficiency of wvawc’s facilities and negligence by wvawc in the design maintenance and operation of the water system the plaintiffs seek unspecified alleged damages on behalf of the class for lost profits annoyance and inconvenience and loss of use as well as punitive damages for willful reckless and wanton behavior in not addressing the risk of pipe failure and a large outage 

in october 2017 wvawc filed with the court a motion seeking to dismiss all of the plaintiffs’ counts alleging statutory and common law tort claims furthermore wvawc asserted that the public service commission of west virginia and not the court has primary jurisdiction over allegations involving violations of the applicable tariff the public utility code and related rules on may 30 2018 the court at a hearing denied wvawc’s motion to apply the primary jurisdiction doctrine and on october 11 2018 the court issued a written order to that effect the court has not yet issued a written order on wvawc’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ tort claims the court has requested the parties submit a scheduling order with a trial date of august 26 2019 and wvawc has sought to prevent further discovery while its motion to dismiss is pending 

the company and wvawc believe that wvawc has valid meritorious defenses to the claims raised in this class action complaint and wvawc will continue to vigorously defend itself against these allegations

financial results 

the following table provides our diluted earnings per share gaap and our adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure 



for the year ended december 31 2018  diluted earnings per share gaap were 315  an increase  of 077  per diluted share or 324  compared to the   prior year which includes the net adjustments presented in the table above and discussed in greater detail in the “ adjustments to gaap ” section below 

excluding the net adjustments presented in the table above   adjusted diluted earnings per share nongaap were 330  for the year ended december 31 2018  an increase of 027  per diluted share or 89  compared   to the prior year    

these results were driven by continued growth in our   regulated businesses   from infrastructure investment acquisitions and organic growth combined with strong results in our   marketbased businesses  primarily in  our homeowner services group   with   the midyear acquisition of pivotal  these increases were partially offset by higher om and depreciation expenses from the growth of the business and a lower tax shield on interest expense at the parent company resulting from the tcja     

for the year ended december 31 2017  diluted earnings per share gaap were 238  per diluted share a decrease  of 024  per diluted share or 92  compared to the prior year which includes the net adjustments presented in the table above and discussed in greater detail in the “ adjustments to gaap ” section below 

excluding the net adjustments presented in the table above adjusted diluted earnings per share nongaap were 303  for the year ended december 31 2017  an increase of 019  per diluted share or 67   compared to the prior year   

these results were driven by continued growth in our   regulated businesses   from infrastructure investment acquisitions and organic growth combined with growth in our   marketbased businesses   from our homeowner services group and keystone these increases were partially offset by   lower water services demand in our   regulated businesses  and lower capital upgrades in our military services group   

adjustments to gaap   

adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a nongaap financial measure and is calculated as gaap diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of one or more of the following events i a gain in the third quarter of 2018 on the sale of the majority of our contract services group ’s om contracts ii a goodwill and intangible impairment charge in the third quarter of 2018 resulting from narrowing the scope of the keystone business iii insurance settlements received in the third quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2018 related to the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia iv noncash remeasurement charges recorded in the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2018 resulting from the impact of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate on the company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of the tcja v an early extinguishment of debt charge at the parent company in the third quarter of 2017 and vi a charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims related to the freedom industries chemical spill 

we believe that this nongaap measure provides investors with useful information by excluding certain matters that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating results and that providing this nongaap measure will allow investors to understand better our businesses’ operating performance and facilitate a meaningful yeartoyear comparison of our results of operations although management uses this nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our results of operations we do not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by gaap and the reader should not consider them as indicators of performance this nongaap financial measure is derived from our consolidated financial information and it should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure as defined and used above may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap measures used by other companies and accordingly it may have significant limitations on its use 

achievements and strategic focus 

we believe our success has and will continue to be guided by the following strategic philosophies 



our strategy which is driven by our vision and values will continue to be anchored on our five central themes 



 regulated businesses  growth 

 marketbased businesses  growth and optimization 



 the following chart depicts the estimated allocation of our expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses  over the next five years by purpose 

 our adjusted om efficiency ratio is defined as the operation and maintenance expenses from our regulated businesses  divided by the pro forma operating revenues from our regulated businesses  where both operation and maintenance expenses and pro forma operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense additionally from operation and maintenance expenses we excluded the allocable portion of nonoperation and maintenance support services costs mainly depreciation and general taxes that are reflected in our regulated businesses segment as operation and maintenance expenses but for consolidated financial reporting purposes are categorized within other line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

in addition to the adjustments discussed above for periodtoperiod comparability purposes we have presented the estimated impact of the tcja on operating revenues for our regulated businesses on a pro forma basis for all periods presented prior to january 1 2018 as if the lower federal corporate income tax rate was in effect for these periods see note 7—regulatory assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information we also made the following adjustments to our om efficiency ratio i excluded from operation and maintenance expenses the impact of certain freedom industries chemical spill settlement activities recognized in 2016 2017 and 2018 and ii excluded from operation and maintenance expenses the impact of the company’s january 1 2018 adoption of accounting standards update 201707 improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost  “asu 201707” for 2016 2017 and 2018 see note 2—significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we excluded the items discussed above from the calculation as we believe such items are not reflective of management’s ability to increase the efficiency of our regulated businesses  

we evaluate our operating performance using this ratio because we believe it directly measures improvement in the efficiency of our regulated businesses  this information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance our adjusted om efficiency ratio is not an accounting measure that is based on gaap may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures and should not be used in place of the gaap information provided elsewhere in this form 10k 

with respect to our adjusted om efficiency ratio goal for 2023 we are unable to provide without unreasonable efforts a quantitative reconciliation of each component of this ratio to the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap in calculating the components of the ratio certain items that may ultimately be excluded would be reflective of events that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time the unavailable information would include among other things the impact of items currently excluded from the calculation of the components adjustments for weather conditions that exceed a certain threshold of variability and adjustments for events or circumstances that may not be reflective of ongoing operating results the probable significance of these items is also presently unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated 

the following table provides the calculation of our adjusted om efficiency ratio and a reconciliation that compares operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues each as determined in accordance with gaap to those amounts utilized in the calculation of our adjusted om efficiency ratio

tax matters 

tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017  the tcja was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  as of january 1 2018 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including continuation of interest expense deductibility the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income tax the enactment of the tcja required a remeasurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position the portion of this remeasurement related to our regulated businesses  was substantially offset by a regulatory liability as we believe it is probable that the deferred income tax excesses created by the tcja will benefit our regulated customers in future rates the remaining portion of this remeasurement of the net deferred income tax liability was recorded as a noncash charge to earnings during the fourth quarter of 2017 during 2018 we continued to gather assess and evaluate additional guidance and regulations related to the changes related to the tcja as a result of this process we have recorded additional adjustments to finalize our initial 2017 estimates see note 14—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

during 2018 the company’s 14  regulatory jurisdictions began to consider the impacts of the tcja the company has adjusted customer rates to reflect the lower income tax rate in 10  states in one  of those 10  states a portion of the tax savings is being used to reduce certain regulatory assets in one  additional state we are using the tax savings to offset additional capital investment and to reduce a regulatory asset proceedings in the other three  jurisdictions remain pending   with respect to excess accumulated deferred income taxes regulators in the eight  states that have considered the issue have agreed with our overall timeline of passing the excess back to customers beginning no earlier than 2019 when the company is able to produce the normalization schedule using the average rate assumption method in one  of those states we will use the amortization of the excess accumulated deferred income taxes to offset future infrastructure investments 

on march 23 2018 president trump signed the consolidated appropriations act of 2018 the “caa” the caa corrects and clarifies some aspects of the tcja related to bonus depreciation eligibility specifically property that was acquired or the construction began prior to september 27 2017 is eligible for bonus depreciation this clarification allowed the company to benefit from additional bonus depreciation deductions on the 2017 tax return and as a result we believe that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019 when we expect our federal nol carryforwards balance will be fully used and expect to be a full year cash taxpayer by 2020 although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in our future results of operations and the outcome of pending regulatory proceedings regarding the tcja 

on november 26 2018 the us department of the treasury released proposed regulations concerning interest expense limitation rules the tcja revised and broadened the existing interest expense limitation regulations the company has considered all the rules set forth in the proposed regulation including allocated interest expense and interest income based on the relative amounts of the company’s adjusted basis in the assets used in its excepted and nonexcepted trades or business or our regulated businesses  and marketbased businesses  based on our interpretation of the new guidance the company reasonably believes the deductibility of its interest expense will not be limited under the new regulations 

other tax matters 

on june 1 2018 the state of missouri enacted legislation that decreased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to missouri from 625 to 400 beginning in the 2020 tax year as a result we were required to remeasure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the lower state income tax rate in the second quarter of 2018 this resulted in a decrease to the company’s unitary deferred income tax liability of 12 million and an increase to a regulatory liability of 13 million as we believe it is probable of refund in future rates 

on may 30 2018 the state of iowa enacted legislation that decreased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to iowa from 120 to 98 beginning in the 2021 tax year the deferred income tax liability for our iowa subsidiary was reduced by 1 million and offset by a regulatory liability as we believe this liability is probable of refund in future rates 

on april 13 2018 the state of kentucky enacted legislation that decreased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to kentucky from 6 to 5 beginning in the 2018 tax year in addition beginning in the 2019 tax year a consolidated return including all affiliated group members will be required as a result we were required to record a deferred income tax liability of 7 million for our kentucky unitary filing group and the existing deferred income tax liability related to our kentucky subsidiary was reduced by 1 million offset by a regulatory liability as we believe this liability is probable of refund in future rates 

the company performed its annual review of the apportionment rates in all of its unitary filing jurisdictions and implemented changes to reflect considerations for historical results and future business outlooks in each of the jurisdictions as of december 31 2018  we recorded a noncash cumulative charge to earnings of 12 million  resulting from the legislative changes described above and the adjustments made through various state income tax apportionment rates 

on july 1 2018 the state of new jersey enacted legislation that increased the corporate business tax rate from 90 to 115 for the 2018 and 2019 tax years and to 105 for the 2020 and 2021 tax years the tax rate will revert back to 90 for tax year 2022 and beyond additionally the new legislation states that for the year beginning on and after january 1 2019 a unitary group will be required to file a combined unitary new jersey tax return the legislation allows a deduction over a 10year period commencing five years after the enactment of unitary combined reporting if the combined reporting provisions result in an aggregate increase to the net deferred income tax liability or an aggregate decrease to the net deferred income tax asset thus the deferred income tax liability resulting from the unitary filing requirement would be completely offset by the deferred income tax asset derived from this deduction there are no underlying impacts to the company’s earnings as a result of the new filing requirement on october 4 2018 new jersey’s governor signed a technical correction bill into law the correction bill provides an exclusion for water and wastewater utility companies whose rates are regulated from the combined reporting requirement the company’s tax credit granted by the state of new jersey will not be impacted by the law changes mentioned above

in 2017  operating supplies and services decreased   3 million  or 14  primarily due to a decrease in charges recorded in 2016 including a 5 million writeoff of timekeeping system costs that were previously capitalized and a 7 million judgment in litigation partially offset by an increase in office supplies and services from higher employee relocation telecommunication and office supplies costs 

maintenance materials and supplies 

in 2018  maintenance materials and supplies increased   11 million  or 157  from a higher volume of main breaks and paving costs driven by the colder weather experienced during the first quarter of 2018 as well as higher tank painting costs in our new jersey subsidiary and various maintenance projects in our pennsylvania missouri and indiana subsidiaries

other operation and maintenance    

in 2018  other operation and maintenance increased   10 million  or 588  primarily due to higher casualty insurance claims in 2018 and a 3 million charge from a regulatory authorization allowing a portion of the income tax savings resulting from the tcja to be used to reduce certain regulatory assets during 2018 we recorded a 20 million benefit resulting from an insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia 

in 2017  other operation and maintenance decreased   90 million  or 841  primarily due to a 65 million net charge recorded in 2016 resulting from the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia and a 22 million benefit recorded in 2017 resulting from a related insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers as well as a decrease in casualty insurance expense attributable to a lower claims experience in 2017 

depreciation and amortization 

in 2018  and 2017  depreciation and amortization increased   38 million  and 22 million  or 82  and 50  respectively the increase for both periods was primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service 

general taxes 

in 2018  and 2017  general taxes increased   17 million  and 2 million  or 70  and 08  respectively the increase in 2018 was primarily due to incremental property taxes in several of our subsidiaries including in missouri and new york

in 2018  and 2017  gain on asset dispositions and purchases increased   9 million  or 563  and decreased   9 million  or 1286  respectively the decrease in 2018 was primarily due to higher gains recognized in 2017 including a 7 million gain on a land sale in our kentucky subsidiary along with acquisition and land sale gains in our pennsylvania missouri and california subsidiaries partially offset by gains recognized in 2018 for the sale of a treatment plant in our illinois subsidiary and a building in our new jersey subsidiary 

interest net 

in 2018  and 2017  interest net increased 12 million  and 12 million  respectively the increase in interest expense during 2018 was driven by the issuance of incremental longterm debt in the third quarter of 2018 to support growth of the business and higher levels of shortterm borrowings during 2018 coupled with an increase in the average shortterm borrowing rate in the current year for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of incremental longterm debt in 2017 to support growth of the business 

other income expenses 

in 2018  other income expenses increased   19 million  or 71  primarily due to a reduction in the nonservice cost components of pension and other postretirement benefits expense resulting from favorable actuarial performance and an increase in allowance for funds used during construction attributable to higher capital investment in 2018 partially offset by an increase in interest expense as discussed above for the year ended december 31 2017 the increase in other income expenses was primarily due to an increase in interest expense as discussed above 

provision for income taxes 

for the year ended december 31 2018  our provision for income taxes decreased primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as of january 1 2018 resulting from the enactment of the tcja we expect the reduced tax rate will benefit our customers through established ratemaking tax and regulatory normalization provisions during 2018 we continued assessing the impacts of the tcja as allowed by staff accounting bulletin 118 “sab 118” and as a result we recorded adjustments to federal and state income tax tcja estimates for the year ended december 31 2017 our provision for income taxes increased primarily due to higher pretax income in 2017 compared to 2016

 depreciation and amortization 

in 2018  and 2017  depreciation and amortization increased   11 million  and 3 million  or 611  and 200  respectively the increase in 2018  was primarily due to the addition of property plant and equipment and intangible assets from the acquisition of pivotal on june 4 2018  

gain on asset dispositions and purchases 

in 2018  gain on asset dispositions and purchases increased   13 million  primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of the majority of our contract services group ’s om contracts to subsidiaries of veolia environnement sa during the third quarter of 2018 partially offset by a loss recognized on the sale of property plant and equipment in keystone see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the veolia environnement sa transaction 

impairment charge 

during the third quarter of 2018 a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of 57 million  was recorded for keystone the result of operational and financial challenges encountered in the construction business and the company’s determination to narrow the scope of the keystone business to focus on its core operations of providing water transfer services see note 8—goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

provision for income taxes 

in 2018  and 2017  provision for income taxes decreased   17 million  or 607  and increased   2 million  or 77  respectively the decrease in 2018  was primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  as of january 1 2018 resulting from the enactment of the tcja 

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate and monitor our cash requirements for capital investments acquisitions operations commitments debt maturities interest and dividends our business is capital intensive with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations when necessary we also obtain funds from external sources primarily in the debt markets and through shortterm commercial paper borrowings we also have access to equity capital markets if needed our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the utility and water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas if these business market financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer are able to access the capital markets on reasonable terms we have access to an unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of 225 billion  with an expiration date of june 2023 subject to extension by us for up to two oneyear periods we rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to support our 210 billion  commercial paper program disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets see “credit facilities and shortterm debt” section below for additional information 

in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we through awcc our wholly owned financing subsidiary issue commercial paper which is supported by the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2018  awcc had no  outstanding borrowings and 81 million  of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility with 225 billion  available to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit which supported 954 million  in outstanding commercial paper we believe that our ability to access the capital markets our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our shortterm requirements we have no plans to issue equity under normal operating conditions in the foreseeable future with the limited exception of privately or investorowned acquisitions whose sellers require equity to complete the acquisition or other opportunistic acquisitions we believe we have sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage our expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets however we can provide no assurances that the lenders will meet their existing commitments to awcc under the revolving credit facility or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated businesses  receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from our regulated businesses  rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based upon regulatory guidelines the taxability of advances and contributions in aid of construction was changed with the enactment of the tcja previously the majority of advances and contributions that we collected were not taxable however with the enactment of the tcja they are now treated as taxable income regulatory treatment for advances and contributions under the tcja has been resolved by most of our regulatory jurisdictions in a manner that passes the tax consequences of the change in law to the customer making the advance or contribution or allows the utility to pass those consequences onto a larger base of customers we are working with the remaining regulatory jurisdictions to determine impacts to the company and our customers 

we use our capital resources including cash primarily to i fund operating and capital requirements ii pay interest and meet debt maturities iii pay dividends iv fund acquisitions v fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations and vi we estimate beginning at the end of 2019 to pay federal income taxes we invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where we expect to earn a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag see item 1—business — regulated businesses — economic regulation and rate making  for additional information we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greater than our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly if necessary we may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity in this event we believe we can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet our obligations and fund our minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

with the enactment of the tcja and the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  we anticipate a decrease in future revenue authorizations associated with our regulated businesses  initially leading to lower cash flows we expect this cash flow impact to decline over time as our regulated businesses ’ rate base grows the result of lower deferred income tax liabilities which offset rate base the lower deferred income tax liabilities are mainly due to i a lower us federal corporate income tax rate ii the normalization refunding to customers of the remeasured deferred income tax liabilities over the remaining life of the associated assets and iii the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects that began after september 27 2017 

the water infrastructure finance and innovation act of 2014 “wifia” established the wifia program a federal credit program administered by the epa for eligible water and wastewater infrastructure projects the wifia program accelerates investment in our nation’s water infrastructure by providing longterm lowcost supplemental loans for regionally and nationally significant projects our letters of interest have been approved by the epa and we have begun the full application process for two wifia loans totaling 187 million  for two separate projects in our missouri subsidiary 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

cash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the warmer months our future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by among other things economic utility regulation inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs maintenance costs customer growth declining customer usage of water employeerelated costs including pension funding weather and seasonality taxes and overall economic conditions 

we expect that the enactment of the tcja to be accretive to our consolidated earnings over time through i growth in rate base for the same level of expected capital expenditures due to the impact of the lower us federal corporate income tax rate and the remeasurement of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities ii increased earnings in our marketbased businesses  due to the lower us federal corporate income tax rate all partially offset by iii the lower tax shield on interest expense at the parent as well as increased debt levels from lower cash flows from operations as we pass the lower tax rate benefits to our regulated customers we believe that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019 when we expect our federal nol carryforwards balance will be fully used and expect to be a full year cash taxpayer by 2020 although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in our future results of operations and the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the tcja 

cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund the majority of our capital investments we expect to seek access to debt capital markets to meet the balance of our capital investment if any and fund our dividend payments as needed we also have access to equity capital markets if needed we do not foresee the need to access equity markets over the next five years under normal operating conditions operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments changes in our marketbased businesses  changes in the economy interest rates the timing of tax payments and our customers’ ability to pay for service in a timely manner among other items we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future sometimes our current liabilities exceed current assets mainly from debt maturities due within one year and the periodic use of shortterm debt as a funding source primarily to meet scheduled maturities of longterm debt fund acquisitions and construction projects as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business we address cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows provided by operating activities 



 in 2018  cash flows provided by operating activities decreased   63 million  primarily due to lower revenues as a result of the enactment of the tcja and changes in working capital these decreases are partially offset by an increase in net income the main factors contributing to the net income increase are described in this section under “consolidated results of operations” and included higher operating revenue and a lower provision for income taxes 

in 2017  cash flows provided by operations increased   160 million  primarily due to an increase in net income after noncash adjustments including the impact of the enactment of the tcja and an increase in cash flows from working capital the main factors contributing to the net income increase are described in the “consolidated results of operations” section and include higher operating revenues partially offset by higher income taxes due to a 125 million  remeasurement charge resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of the tcja the increase in noncash activities was mainly attributable to the increase in deferred income taxes as mentioned above and an increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service the change in working capital was principally due to i the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities including the accrual recorded during 2016 for the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia ii a decrease in unbilled revenues as a result of our military services group  achieving significant capital project milestones during 2016 and iii a change in other current assets and liabilities including the decrease in other current assets associated with the termination of our four forward starting swap agreements and timing of payments clearing our cash accounts 

the company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of up to 31 million  in 2019  in addition we estimate that contributions will amount to 32 million  29 million  29 million  and 29 million  in 2020  2021  2022  and 2023  respectively actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns among other factors 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows used in investing activities 



  



in 2018  and 2017  cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in our regulated capital expenditures principally from incremental investments associated with the replacement and renewal of our transmission and distribution infrastructure in our regulated businesses  as well as acquisitions in both our regulated businesses  and marketbased businesses  as discussed below 

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures related to the upgrading of our infrastructure and systems 



in 2018  our capital expenditures increased   152 million  or 106  primarily due to investment across the majority of our infrastructure categories in 2017  our capital expenditures increased   123 million  or 94  primarily due to investment in our general structure and equipment and wastewater categories 

we also grow our business primarily through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems as well as other waterrelated services these acquisitions are complementary to our existing business and support continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt 

the following is a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities 

2018  

 2017  

 2016  



as previously noted we expect to invest between 80 billion  to 86 billion  from 2019  to 2023  with 73 billion  of this range for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses  in 2019  we expect to invest between a range of 17 billion  to 18 billion  in 2019  with 16 billion  for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses  also in 2019  we expect to invest between 120 million  to 240 million  for acquisitions in our regulated businesses  

cash flows from financing activities 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows provided by financing activities 



 in 2018 cash flows provided by financing activities increased   519 million  primarily due to the issuance of common stock to finance a portion of the purchase price of the pivotal acquisition and a decrease in cash used for shortterm borrowings shortterm borrowings were used to fund the growth of our regulated businesses  finance approximately 50 of the pivotal acquisition pay dividends and repay longterm debt offset by the use of the 1325 billion longterm debt issuance to support growth of the business and repay shortterm borrowings 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding regulated infrastructure expenditures regulated and marketbased acquisitions and payment of dividends these activities included the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc and in 2018 included an equity issuance for approximately 50 of the pivotal acquisition in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction net of refunds which amounted to 21 million  28 million  and 16 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively based on the needs of our regulated businesses  and the company awcc may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then through intercompany loans provide those borrowings to the regulated businesses  and the parent company the regulated businesses  and the parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations the parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated businesses  therefore the parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates as of december 31 2018  awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to our regulated businesses  amounting to 44 billion  and 392 million  respectively additionally as of december 31 2018  awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the parent company amounting 17 billion  and 533 million  respectively as of december 31 2018  the parent company has made longterm fixed rate loans to our marketbased businesses  amounting to 183 million  related to the acquisition of pivotal on june 4 2018  

on august 9 2018  awcc completed a 1325 billion debt offering which included the sale of 625 million aggregate principal amount of its unsecured 375 senior notes due in 2028 and 700 million aggregate principal amount of its unsecured 420 senior notes due in 2048 at the closing of the offering awcc received after deduction of underwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses net proceeds of approximately 13 billion  awcc used proceeds from the offering to i lend funds to american water and its regulated operating subsidiaries ii repay 191 million  principal amount of awcc’s 562  senior notes due 2018 upon maturity on december 21 2018 iii prepay 100 million  aggregate principal amount of awcc’s outstanding 562  series e senior notes due march 29 2019 the “series e notes” and 100 million  aggregate principal amount of awcc’s outstanding 577  series f senior notes due march 29 2022 the “series f notes” and together with the series e notes the “series notes” and iv repay awcc’s commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes 

as a result of awcc’s prepayment of the series notes a makewhole premium of 10 million  was paid to the holders thereof on september 11 2018 substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs were allocable to our utility subsidiaries and recorded as regulatory assets as we believe they are probable of recovery in future rates 

on august 6 2018  the company terminated four forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 400 million  realizing a net gain of 9 million  to be amortized through interest net over 10  and 30 year periods in correlation with the terms of the new debt issued on august 9 2018  

on august 17 2018  we entered into two forward starting swap agreements each with a notional amount of 80 million  to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019 these forward starting swap agreements terminate in august 2019  and have an average fixed rate of 298  on october 11 2018  we entered into two additional forward starting swap agreements each with a notional amount of 100 million  to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019 these forward starting swap agreements terminate in december 2019  and have an average fixed rate of 331  on january 8 2019  we entered into an additional forward starting swap agreement with a notional amount of 150 million  to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019 this forward starting swap agreement terminates in december 2019  and has an average fixed rate of 276  we have designated these forward starting swap agreements as cash flow hedges with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss upon termination the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest net over the term of the new debt 

one of the principal market risks to which the company is exposed is changes in interest rates in order to manage the exposure we follow risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps we reduce exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments the derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations we minimize the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by only dealing with leading creditworthy financial institutions having longterm credit ratings of “a” or better 

on april 11 2018  we effected an equity forward transaction by entering into a forward sale agreement with each of two  forward purchasers in connection with a public offering of 2320000  shares of our common stock in the equity forward transaction the forward purchasers or an affiliate borrowed an aggregate of 2320000  shares of our common stock from third parties and sold them to the underwriters in the public offering on june 7 2018  we elected to fully and physically settle both forward sale agreements resulting in the issuance of a total of 2320000  shares of our common stock at a price of 7901  per share for aggregate net proceeds of 183 million  the net proceeds of the transaction were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the pivotal acquisition on june 4 2018  

in may 2018 the parent company and awcc filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that enables us to meet our capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities including american water common stock preferred stock and other equity and hybrid securities and awcc debt securities all subject to market conditions and demand general economic conditions and as applicable rating status the shelf registration statement will expire in may 2021 during 2018  2017  and 2016  1325 billion  1350 billion  and 550 million  respectively of debt securities were issued pursuant to this and predecessor registration statements additionally during 2018 under this registration statement we issued 2320000  shares of our common stock at a price of 7901  per share for aggregate net proceeds of 183 million

from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements through tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

in february 2015 our board of directors authorized an antidilutive common stock repurchase program to mitigate the effect of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities the program allows the company to purchase up to 10 million  shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions the program is conducted in accordance with rule 10b18 of the exchange act and to facilitate the repurchases we have also entered into rule 10b51 share repurchase plans with a thirdparty broker which allows us to repurchase shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods subject to applicable regulations we may elect to amend or cancel this repurchase program or the share repurchase parameters at our discretion as of december 31 2018  we have repurchased an aggregate of 4510000  shares of common stock under this program 

credit facilities and shortterm debt 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility of 225 billion  that expires in june 2023 in march 2018 awcc and its lenders amended and restated the credit agreement with respect to awcc’s revolving credit facility to increase the maximum commitments under the facility from 175 billion  to 225 billion  and to extend the expiration date of the facility from june 2020 to march 2023 all other terms conditions and covenants with respect to the existing facility remained unchanged subject to satisfying certain conditions the credit agreement also permits awcc to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of 500 million  and to request extensions of its expiration date for up to two oneyear periods 

interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the libor rate or base rate in accordance with moody investors service’s and standard  poor’s financial services’ then applicable credit rating on awcc’s senior unsecured noncredit enhanced debt the facility is used principally to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 150 million  in letters of credit indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between the company and awcc which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by the company of awcc’s payment obligations under the credit facility 

awcc also has an outstanding commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility the maximum aggregate outstanding amount of which was increased in march 2018 from 160 billion  to 210 billion  

the following table provides the aggregate credit facility commitments letter of credit sublimit under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper limit as well as the available capacity for each as of december 31 2018  and 2017  



the weighted average interest rate on awcc shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017  was approximately 228  and 124  respectively 

capital structure 

the following table provides the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31 



the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in longterm debt 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance with these covenants an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue new debt or access our revolving credit facility our longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things prohibit or restrict the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations 

covenants in certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization as defined in the relevant documents of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2018  our ratio was 059  to 100 and therefore we were in compliance with the covenants 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets may be directly affected by our securities ratings we primarily access the debt capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we have also issued debt through our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds to lower our overall cost of debt 

the following table provides our longterm and shortterm credit rating and rating outlook as of february 19 2019  



on june 11 2018 standard  poor’s ratings service affirmed the company’s longterm ‘a’ and shortterm ‘a1’ credit ratings with a stable outlook remaining unchanged 

on january 19 2018 moody’s investors service changed its rating outlook to negative from stable for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies including the company all of which were primarily impacted by the enactment of the tcja 

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that we provide collateral to secure our obligations we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends and regulatory restrictions 

for discussion of our dividends dividend restrictions and dividend policy see note 9—shareholders equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims additionally annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a goingforward basis we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business the following table provides information related to our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  



  



publicprivate partnerships 

wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs these payments are considered “pilot payments” which represent payments that wvawc otherwise would pay as property taxes on the properties we have presented the transaction on a net basis on the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities which is presented in property plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets was approximately 147 million  as of december 31 2018  

performance obligations 

we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers for discussion of our performance obligations see note 3—revenue recognition  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates assumptions and judgments that could affect the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows actual results could differ from these estimates assumptions and judgments management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows as reflected in our consolidated financial statements management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with our audit finance and risk committee including the estimates assumptions and judgments used in their application additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in note 2—significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulation and regulatory accounting 

our regulated utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by pucs and as such we follow the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our consolidated financial statements use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria i thirdparty regulation of rates ii costbased rates and iii a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service plus a return on net investment or rate base as of december 31 2018  we concluded that the operations of our utilities met the criteria 

application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on our financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process we make significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities such judgments include but are not limited to assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions pension and postretirement benefits depreciation rates and taxes due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a nonregulated entity to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates conversely the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers regulators may also impose certain fines or penalties 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we assess at the end of each reporting period whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pending or potential legislation that could impact the ability to recover costs through regulated rates if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our consolidated statements of operations and financial position could be materially affected in addition if we conclude in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

on december 22 2017  the tcja was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  as of january 1 2018 the tcja created significant excess deferred income taxes that we and our regulatory jurisdictions believe should be refunded to customers as such we recorded these amounts as regulatory liabilities 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our regulatory asset balance was 12 billion  and 11 billion  respectively and our regulatory liability balance was 19 billion  and 17 billion  respectively see note 7—regulatory assets and liabilities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

goodwill 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  our goodwill balances were 16 billion  and 14 billion  respectively in accordance with gaap goodwill must be allocated at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below and tested for impairment at least annually we perform our annual impairment testing of goodwill as of november 30  of each year or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value adverse industry or economic trends lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization among other things may be indicators of potential goodwill impairment issues requiring further testing of a reporting unit’s carrying value 

entities testing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary in performing a qualitative assessment we assess and make judgments among other things around macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors and entity specific events these factors require significant judgment and estimates and application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results if it is determined based upon qualitative factors that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value no further testing is required if we bypass the qualitative assessment or perform the qualitative assessment and determine that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value a quantitative fair valuebased test is performed this quantitative test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value including goodwill on the measurement date an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

application of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting units we estimate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market multiples analysis significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include but are not limited to forecasts of future operating results discount and growth rates capital expenditures tax rates working capital weighted average cost of capital and projected terminal values changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results see note 8—goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our goodwill 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include property plant and equipment goodwill intangible assets and longterm investments we evaluate our longlived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable such circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the asset a change in the asset’s expected useful life or physical condition a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or is planned to be used when such indicators arise we estimate the fair value of the longlived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the asset and compare the estimated value fair to the carrying value of the asset an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the longlived asset’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of a longlived asset and thus could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of our regulated businesses  are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the company holds other investments in privately held companies and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method the estimated fair value of the longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which the company invests as well as volatility inherent in the external markets if such longterm investments are considered impaired an impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the investment’s carrying value compared to its estimated fair value 

the company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value longlived assets to be appropriate however if actual experience differs from the assumptions and considerations used in its estimates the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue from the company’s regulated businesses is generated primarily from water and wastewater services delivered to customers these contracts contain a single performance obligation the delivery of water or wastewater services as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises within the contracts and therefore is not distinct revenues are recognized over time as services are provided there are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts calculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill to the end of the accounting period the amounts that the company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value transferred to the customer 

increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue in addition changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation unbilled revenue for our regulated utilities as of december 31 2018  and 2017  was 144 million  and 152 million  respectively 

the company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process 

revenue from the company’s homeowner services group  is generated through various protection programs in which the company provides fixed fee services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against repair costs for interior and external water and sewer lines interior electric and gas lines heating and cooling systems water heaters power surge protection and other related services most of the contracts have a oneyear term and each service is a separate performance obligation satisfied over time as the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided from the service customers are obligated to pay for the protection programs ratably over 12 months or via a onetime annual fee with revenues recognized ratably over time for these services advances from customers are deferred until the performance obligation is satisfied 

the company also has longterm fixed fee contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater facilities with the us government on various military bases and facilities owned by municipal and industrial customers as well as shorterterm contracts that provide customized water transfer services for shale natural gas companies and customers billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract as customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the company additionally these contracts allow the company to make capital improvements to underlying infrastructure which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract whereby standalone fixed pricing is separately stated for each improvement the company has determined that these capital improvements are separate performance obligations with revenue recognized over time based on performance completed at the end of each reporting period losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the losses first become probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues with billings in excess of revenues recorded as other current liabilities until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined unbilled revenue for our marketbased businesses  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  was 42 million  and 60 million  respectively 

accounting for income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and the utilization of nol carryforwards 

in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not morelikelythannot that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits no benefit is recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we conclude it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

under gaap specifically accounting standards codification topic 740 income taxes “asc 740” the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted asc 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled thus at the date of enactment of the tcja the company’s deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new tax rate for our regulated entities the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to refund to customers for our unregulated operations the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a noncash remeasurement adjustment to earnings 

the staff of the sec has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of changes in tax law more specifically the tcja and on december 22 2017 issued guidance in sab 118 which clarifies accounting for income taxes under asc 740 if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting sab 118 describes three scenarios or buckets associated with a company’s status of accounting for the tcja i a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform ii a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount or iii a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply asc 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the tcja being enacted the significant assumptions considered and evaluated by the company relating to accounting for the tcja include but are not limited to the 

 actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws our forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for our regulated businesses  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2018  and 2017  are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 14—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations see note 15—employee benefits  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 



 the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices we use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 438  375  and 428  at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 432  373  and 426  at december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

in selecting an eroa we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 595  for 2018  649  for 2017  and 702  for 2016  the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 477  for 2018  509  for 2017  and 537  for 2016  

the following table provides the allocations of the pension plan assets by asset category 



during 2017 the company reduced the risk of its investments in the pension plan by reducing its exposure to equities from 60 to 50 and increasing its long duration fixedincome allocation from 40 to 50 this structure is designed to reduce the plan’s funded status volatility it is also intended to reduce the pension plan’s exposure to interest rates since a higher proportion of long duration fixedincome securities that have a duration similar to that of the pension liabilities should reduce interest rate risk associated with the plan’s liabilities 

postretirement medical bargaining plan changes   

on july 31 2018  a new five year national benefits agreement was ratified covering approximately 3200  of our unionrepresented employees most of the benefits under this new agreement will become effective on january 1 2019 and include among other things unionrepresented employees’ participation in the company’s cashbased annual performance plan additional medical plan options and changes to certain retiree medical benefits which required the company to remeasure its other postretirement benefit plan obligation during the third quarter of 2018 

for those eligible union retirees and dependents over age 65 the current supplemental retiree medical plan will be replaced with a health reimbursement arrangement “hra” similar to the cap currently in place for nonunion retirees the company is providing a subsidy allowing the post65 retirees to purchase a medicare supplemental plan on a private exchange network the pre65 coverage plan was also amended to provide a cap on future employer costs designed to limit the employer costs to 2018 levels for pre65 union members retiring early in 20192021 a supplemental benefit will be provided to alleviate the effect of the cap 

on august 31 2018  the postretirement medical benefit plan was remeasured to reflect this plan change the plan change resulted in a 175 million  reduction in future benefits payable to plan participants and in combination with other experience reflected as of the remeasurement date resulted in a 227 million reduction to the net accumulated postretirement benefit obligation the plan amendment will be amortized over 102  years the average future working lifetime to full eligibility age for all plan participants 

after the remeasurement the retirement and benefit plans investment committee the “investment committee” which is responsible for overseeing the investment of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets determined that the funded status of the postretirement medical bargaining plan was in excess of that needed to pay current and future benefits 

given the change in funded status the investment committee commissioned a new assetliability study for the postretirement medical bargaining plan this study concluded that it was prudent to decrease the risk in the plan and to remove its equity exposure the study also recommended reducing its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability the investment committee agreed with the recommendations and approved the investment of the postretirement medical bargaining plan assets in fixedincome securities 

the restructuring of the plan was initiated toward yearend once fully completed the plan’s assets will be invested in fixedincome securities the majority of the securities will be used to match the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability plan assets in excess of those securities designed to match the longterm liabilities will be invested in shorter duration securities with a duration of about three years 

the following table provides the allocations of the other postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category 



  

 the investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets’ values approximately 88  of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 12  of the assets are valued using other inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 3  for 2018  302  for 2017  and 307  for 2016  

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs as of january 1 2017 our health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 7  in 2018  gradually declining to 45  in 2026  and thereafter as of december 31 2018  the company is projecting that medical inflation will be 675 in 2019 and it will ultimately trend down to 5 but not until 2026 

we will use a discount rate and eroa of 438  and 62  respectively for estimating our 2019  pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 432  and 356  respectively for estimating our 2019  other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2018  and 2017  pension and postretirement benefit costs were 21 million  and 56 million  respectively the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts up to 31 million  in 2019  and 32 million  29 million  29 million  and 29 million  in 2020  2021  2022  and 2023  respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

accounting for contingencies 

we record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated the determination of a loss contingency is based on management’s judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter which may include an analysis of different scenarios liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible management considers many factors which include but are not limed to the nature of the litigation claim or assessment review of applicable law opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors and the experience gained from similar cases or situations we provide disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred we provide estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined either as a single amount or within a reasonable range 

actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements see note 16—commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding contingencies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2018  a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1  associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in a 10 million  increase in shortterm interest expense 

as of december 31 2018  the company had four forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 360 million to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019 the forward starting swap agreements terminate in 2019 and have an average fixed rate of 316  when entering into forward starting interest rate swaps the company is subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate that impacts the fair value of the forward starting interest rate swaps we manage market risk by matching terms of the swaps with the critical terms of the expected debt issuance the fair value of the forward starting swaps at december 31 2018  was in a loss position of 14 million  a hypothetical 1  adverse change in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our forward starting swaps of approximately 66 million  at december 31 2018  

on january 8 2019  we entered into an additional forward starting swap agreement with a notional amount of 150 million  to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2019 this forward starting swap agreement terminates in december 2019  and has an average fixed rate of 276  

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated services provided by our regulated businesses  and marketbased businesses  our regulated businesses  serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while our marketbased businesses  engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses  are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities we aim to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixedincome securities that have a duration similar to that of our pension liabilities seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of our liabilities that way if interest rates fall and liabilities increase we expect that the fixedincome assets in our retirement trust will also increase in value we also expect our risk to be reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates 

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses  may be adversely impacted

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2018  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with gaap and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  using the criteria described in internal control—integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

management has excluded pivotal from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018 since it was acquired by the company in a business combination in june 2018 pivotal is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting represent less than 1  and approximately 2  respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2018 

based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control—integrated framework 2013  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2018  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report appearing in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data  of this annual report on form 10k  

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

on june 4 2018  the company completed the acquisition of pivotal see note 4—acquisitions and divestitures  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information we began to integrate pivotal into our internal control over financial reporting structure and expect to complete this integration in 2019 we concluded that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended december 31 2018  other than changes resulting from the acquisition of pivotal that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting as permitted by the sec management has elected to exclude pivotal from its assessment of the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of december 31 2018

business 

tableend our company 

with a history dating back to 1886  american water is the largest and most geographically diverse publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the united states as measured by both operating revenues and population served a holding company originally incorporated in delaware in 1936  we employ approximately 6900  professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to an estimated 15 million  people in 46  states the district of columbia and ontario canada the largest component of the company’s business includes rate regulated subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services collectively presented as our “ regulated businesses ” we conduct the majority of our business through the regulated businesses  segment we also operate several marketbased businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services within four  operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” these four  nonreportable operating segments are collectively presented as our “ marketbased businesses ” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses 

throughout this annual report on form 10k  this “form 10k” unless the context otherwise requires references to “we” “us” “our” the “company” and “american water” mean american water works company inc and its subsidiaries taken together as a whole references to “parent company” mean american water works company inc without its subsidiaries 

regulated businesses      

our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial public authority fire service and sale for resale customers our utilities operate in approximately 1600  communities in 16  states in the united states with approximately 34 million  active customer connections to our water and wastewater networks services provided by our utilities are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation collectively referred to as public utility commissions “pucs” or “regulators” certain federal state and local governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters we report the results of the services provided by our utilities in our regulated businesses  segment operating revenues for our regulated businesses  were 2958 million  for 2017  2871 million  for 2016  and 2743 million  for 2015  accounting for 88  87  and 87  respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods 

the following table geographically summarizes our regulated businesses ’ operating revenues and the number of customers we serve by type of service each as of and for the year ended december 31 2017  



 see item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note 19—segment information  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

customers 

our regulated businesses  have a large and geographically diverse customer base a customer is defined as a person business municipality or any other entity that purchases our water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period one single customer may purchase our services for use by multiple individuals or businesses as is the case in many homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities 

the vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water usage typically on a monthly basis we employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption these methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices touch read or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption 

residential customers make up a substantial portion of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate we also serve i commercial customers such as hospitals food and beverage providers and energy suppliers ii industrial customers such as largescale manufacturers mining and production operations and iii public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools in addition we supply water through our distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities and to other water utilities and community water systems in the form of bulk water supplies for distribution to their own customers 

the following chart depicts the allocation of our regulated businesses ’ operating revenue by type including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer for the year ended december 31 2017  

the following table summarizes the number of water and wastewater customers we served by class as of december 31 



 customer growth in our regulated businesses  is primarily driven by i adding new customers to our customer base through acquisitions of water andor wastewater utility systems ii organic population growth or decline in our authorized service areas and iii sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems 

capital investment 

on an annual basis approximately 2 trillion  gallons of treated water are lost in the united states through more than 240000  main breaks at an estimated cost of 26 billion  this represents approximately 20  of all treated water in the country in addition every year approximately 900 billion  gallons of untreated sewage is discharged into the country’s rivers and streams the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in need of replacement and modernization in 2017 the american society of civil engineers published its report card for america’s infrastructure  in which it gave the drinking water industry a grade of “d” and the wastewater infrastructure a grade of “d” primarily because much of the infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life as documented in the american water works association’s the “awwa” buried no longer confronting america’s water infrastructure challenge  restoring the country’s existing water systems as they reach the end of their useful lives and expanding them to serve a growing population will cost at least 1 trillion between 2011 and 2035 if we are to maintain current levels of water service in addition increased regulation related to water quality and the management of water and wastewater residuals’ discharges which began with the passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 is also a primary driver for the need to modernize 

to address the growing infrastructure needs in the areas we serve we plan to invest 72 billion  over the next five years including a range of 14 billion  to 15 billion  in 2018 for capital improvements to our regulated businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure largely aimed for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities we have proactively doubled our pipe renewal rate over a five year period from 2011 to 2016 from a 250 year replacement cycle to a 120 year replacement cycle which we anticipate will enable us to replace nearly 2000 miles of mains and collection pipes over the next five years in addition during this same five year period capital investment in treatment plants storage tanks and other key aboveground facilities has increased over 10 further addressing aging infrastructure and emerging regulatory compliance needs 

economic regulation and rate making   

our regulated businesses  operate under a regulatory compact whereby in exchange for exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services in defined service territories we have an obligation to serve customers within those territories requesting service within reasonable limits in return for agreeing to invest capital into our water and wastewater systems we are given the opportunity to recover our costs of doing business and earn a reasonable rate of return on our investments 

the operations of our regulated businesses  are generally subject to economic regulation by pucs in the state in which they operate with the primary responsibility of the pucs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital capital expenditures om expenses taxes transactions and affiliate relationships reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

the process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the puc on a periodic basis the timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions our rate case management program is guided by the principles of obtaining timely recovery of capital investment costs recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption and appropriate recovery of utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the program attempts to minimize “regulatory lag” the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates it is for example the time between when an investment in plant is placed into service for the benefit of the customer and when the company can begin earning a return of and on the investment through the ratemaking process it also applies to the lag in the recognition in rate recovery of changes in expenses and revenues 

our regulated businesses  support regulatory practices at the pucs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag examples of approved regulatory practices include 



we pursue or seek enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments in order to continue to provide safe reliable and affordable services to our customers the ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept our proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

acquisitions and strategic growth 

the us water and wastewater industries include investorowned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions both industries are highly fragmented according to the environmental protection agency “epa” approximately 84  of the united states water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98  of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned the epa also estimates that there are approximately 50000  community water systems and approximately 20000  community wastewater systems in the united states with over half of the community water systems serving a population of 500  or less this large number of relatively small fragmented water and wastewater systems may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to their water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool or warm temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time 

a fundamental aspect of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water andor wastewater systems of between 1000 and 30000 customer connections in close geographic proximity to areas where we operate our regulated businesses  the close proximity of acquisition opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using our existing management and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs our current customer mix of 94  water and 6  wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation adding wastewater customers where we already serve water customers we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate pursue acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses  before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to our customers as well as a line of sight to grow our base customers to a significant level to attain efficiencies after entering the new market 

more stringent environmental health and safety and water quality regulations the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment and financial challenges are driving more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets for example in 2015 new jersey enacted the water infrastructure protection act which allows municipalities with a water or wastewater system that meets certain emergent conditions to allow it to sell the system on an expedited basis without a referendum also in 2017 new jersey enacted the water quality accountability act which sets new operational standards for all water utilities in new jersey including municipal and investorowned utilities this law imposes new requirements in areas such as cybersecurity asset management water quality reporting remediation of notices of violation and hydrant and valve maintenance 

we also support full optionality for municipalities including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through fair market valuations of purchased property and the consolidation of water and wastewater rates our regulated businesses  in california illinois indiana missouri new jersey and pennsylvania have access to fair market value legislation for private sector investment in public sector systems fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation providing municipalities with a fair and objective purchase price that is more reflective of the assets’ value while the utility has increased assurance of recovering investment over the life of the assets ultimately we believe that many communities could benefit from receiving safe and reliable water and wastewater service from an experienced utility with proven access to capital and financial technical and managerial resources 

consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility which may or may not be physically interconnected consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state as a result consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state overall this brings costeffective higher quality services to a larger number of citizens ten of our regulated subsidiaries currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing including illinois indiana iowa kentucky maryland missouri new jersey pennsylvania virginia and west virginia 

competition 

in our regulated businesses  we generally do not face direct competition in our existing markets because i we operate in those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a high barrier to market entry however our regulated businesses  do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions when pursuing acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc suez north america american states water company and california water service group from time to time we also face competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as algonquin power and utilities corp and corix 

condemnation and eminent domain 

all or portions of our regulated businesses ’ utility assets could be acquired by state municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods i eminent domain also known as condemnation ii the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original certificate of public convenience and necessity was granted and iii the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its certificate the acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our regulated businesses  operate including for example california provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to seek just compensation against a public utility if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently these actions have occurred in connection with events such as floods mudslides and debris flow broken water mains landslides and wild and brush fires 

water supply and wastewater services 

our regulated businesses  generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to our customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law we are dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from groundwater sources such as wells and aquifers and water purchased from third party water suppliers the level of treatment we apply to the water varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment while groundwater sources require chemical treatment only 

the following chart depicts our sources of water supply as of december 31 2017  

the percentages of water supply by source type for our top seven states for 2017  were as follows 



our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate water supply drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water we employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service territory for example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas we serve may experience wetter than average weather 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate water supply we use longterm planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development an example of our use of longterm planning to ensure that we have adequate water supply is our involvement in the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” in california the water supply project includes the construction of a desalination plant owned by californiaamerican water company “cal am” our wholly owned subsidiary and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant in addition the water supply project also includes cal am’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project between the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the monterey peninsula water management district the “mpwmd” the water supply project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of cal am to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under orders of the california state water resources control board the “swrcb” 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

seasonality 

customer demand for our water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and the frequency of rainfall customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use as such we typically expect our operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues whereas weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues three of our jurisdictions california illinois and new york have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit us to collect state pucauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period thereby lessening the impact of weather variability see “ economic regulation and rate making ” for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms 

marketbased businesses     

through our marketbased businesses  we provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services to military bases municipalities gas exploration and production companies as well as commercial industrial and residential customers these businesses are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs and the services provided do not require significant capital investment operating revenues for our marketbased businesses  were 422 million  for 2017  451 million  for 2016  and 434 million  for 2015  accounting for 13  14  and 14  respectively of the company’s total operating revenues for the same periods included within our marketbased businesses ’ results is operating revenues attributed to canadian operations of 5 million  for 2017  and 6 million  for both 2016  and 2015  respectively 

our marketbased businesses  are comprised of four  operating segments 



military services group 

our military services group has been granted contracts to operate on 13  military bases under 50year contracts with the us government as part of its utility privatization program see item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations —strategic focus and 2017 achievements—growth for additional information the scope of these contracts generally includes the om of the bases’ water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and in certain instances systems expansion the replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the company is funded from the contract fee at times new assets are required to support the base’s mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the us government as additional work under the contract the current capital program does not use the company’s equity or debt borrowings however we may make limited shortterm working capital investments under these contracts and some working capital is used to fund workinprocess until paid by the us government 

the contract price for   nine  of our contracts with the us government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions the remaining four  contracts with the us government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called “economic price adjustment” all of these contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to these contracts we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs our backlog of revenue associated with our contracts with the us government is approximately   36 billion  with an average remaining contract term of 42 years 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group through our various protection programs provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against repair costs for interior and external water and sewer lines interior electric lines heating and cooling systems and water heaters as well as power surge protection and other related services our linesaver™ program involves partnering with utilities municipalities and other organizations to offer our protection programs to customers serviced by or affiliated with those municipalities and organizations terms of these partnership agreements are typically three to five years in length with optional renewals as of december 31 2017  our homeowner services group had approximately 17 million  customer contracts in 43  states and the district of columbia and 10  linesaver™ partnership agreements with municipalities and other organizations 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into contracts to provide om services including the delivery of designbuildoperate projects and the provision of water and wastewater operations maintenance and management services to municipal and regional governmental entities through publicprivate partnerships as well as industrial customers who possess a wide range of water quality and regulatory compliance needs historically we have made minimal longterm capital investment under these contracts instead we perform our services for a fee occasionally we provide our customers with financing for capital projects as part of a longterm om partnership as of december 31 2017  our contract operations group had 33  contracts across the united states and canada varying in size and scope with an average remaining contract term of 3   years in the course of pursuing our longterm strategy and growth initiatives for our marketbased businesses we will concentrate on optimizing the portfolio of contracts in our contract operations group which will involve strategic decisions around the pursuit of renewals of our current contracts approaching expiration as well as the sale of certain contracts that fall outside of our strategic focus 

keystone 

in july 2015 we acquired a 95  interest in water solutions holdings llc including its wholly owned subsidiary keystone keystone is a water service and management solutions company that serves natural gas exploration and production customers in the appalachian basin as well as customers in the municipal water services market keystone is primarily focused on customized water transfer sourcing recycling and storage services along with pipeline construction and related om services keystone operates under master service agreements that are generally shorter term in nature when the initial term of these agreements expire they typically renew automatically on an annual basis and generally are cancelable by either party with 30 days prior notice as of december 31 2017  keystone serves approximately 35  customers 

competition 

we face competition in our marketbased businesses  from a number of service providers including american states water company suez north america and veolia environnement sa in our military services group and pivotal home solutions owned by southern company gas and homeserve usa in our homeowner services group our contract operations group competes in a highly competitive market in order to secure new om contracts as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as the municipal and industrial fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process competitors of our contract operations group include suez north america veolia environnement sa inframark llc and woodard  curran keystone currently faces competition from water service providers that typically provide particular segments of the water management cycle such as select energy services inc tetra technologies inc and fluid delivery solutions llc 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both our regulated businesses  and marketbased businesses  are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we deliver to our customers and the manner in which we collect treat discharge recycle and dispose of wastewater these regulations include the safe drinking water act the lead and copper rule “lcr” the reduction of lead in drinking water act and the clean water act we are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently for example in 2017 the new jersey department of environmental protection announced that it would seek to adopt more stringent maximum contaminant levels for perfluorooctoanic acid or pfoa and perfluorononanoic acid or pfna the overall trend has been that they have become increasingly stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could increase we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental health and safety and water quality standards to which our operations are subject in the past our regulated businesses  have generally been able to recover the costs associated with compliance however this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery we estimate that we will make capital expenditures of 96 million  during 2018  and 138 million  during 2019  for environmental control facilities which we define for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land we also maintain an environmental program that includes responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations and effective use of natural resources we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” authorizes the epa and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as the owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under cercla or comparable state laws although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the us occupational safety and health act and inspections thereunder certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters see item 3—legal proceedings  for additional information 

safe drinking water act 

the safe drinking water act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements to date the epa has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years 

to help formulate the basis for future regulations the epa has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants under the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule the “rule” our laboratory and many of our treatment systems are preparing for the fourth round of testing under the rule which will begin in 2018 there are thousands of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology the process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex but we actively participate with the epa and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge see item 1—business—research and development—emerging containments for further discussion 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in 2006 the epa issued the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule and later in 2006 finalized the ground water rule applicable to systems providing water from underground sources in 2016 the revised total coliform rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects we are within the epa’s time frame for compliance of these standards which includes sample collection data analysis engineering planning and system implementation recent monitoring under the longterm 2 rule has resulted in the need for more than 30 of our surface water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium in most cases this will involve installing uv disinfection at an estimated cost ranging from 150 million to 250 million further the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds we do not anticipate that any such regulations if enacted will require implementation in 2018 

across the company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water we participate in the partnership for safe water the epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 68  of our 72  surface water treatment plants receiving the epa program’s “director” award which recognizes utilities that i have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report ii created an action plan for continuous improvement and iii produced high quality drinking water we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 66  of our surface water treatment plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award 61  plants have received the “tenyear phase iii” award and 54  plants have received the “fifteenyear phase iii” award these awards recognize plants that have met the director award status for five 10 and 15 years respectively further nine  of our surface water plants have received the “presidents” award which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by the state pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

lead and copper rule and lead in drinking water act 

across the country there is a renewed focus on the potential risk of lead in drinking water in 1991 the epa published the lcr to control lead and copper in drinking water and since that time has issued minor revisions in 2000 2004 and 2007 enhancing monitoring reporting and public education requirements in 2011 congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings for fixtures solder and flux while these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water legacy lead plumbing materials primarily in building plumbing still remain in many communities the epa is currently working to develop longterm revisions to the lcr with a revised draft likely in 2018 it is currently estimated that approximately 5 of our service lines contain lead we have reviewed our related practices and are working with stakeholders to develop feasible solutions to remove legacy lead from service lines in older neighborhoods a fundamental step in this effort is the ongoing project to inventory lead service lines across our footprint our goal is to replace our lead service lines in most areas over an approximate 10 year time frame at an estimated cost ranging from 600 million to 12 billion in cases where we are replacing an american water owned lead service line our standard approach will be to replace the companyowned portion of the service line and work with the customer to replace the customerowned portion of the service line replacing the full service line is considered a best practice as advised by the lead service line replacement collaborative an association of leading water industry organizations the prioritization of this work will depend on several factors including our planned water main and service line renewal projects adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities lcr compliance monitoring results and cooperation with our customers with respect to the customerowned portion of the service line 

clean water act 

the clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act which must be renewed every five years pursuant to the npdes permit program the epa and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems discharges that exceed the limits specified under npdes permits can lead to the imposition of penalties and persistent noncompliance could lead to significant penalties and compliance costs in addition the difficulty of obtaining and complying with npdes permits and renewing expiring permits may impose time and cost burdens on our operations from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

environmental social responsibility and governance 

integrating environmental social responsibility and governance “esg” policies and practices into our daily operations emphasizes our belief that the only way to do business is to do it responsibly by delivering value to our customers building strong communities leveraging innovation to develop our industry and supporting the expertise and dedication of our people this focus is derived from our vision statement “clean water for life” and our core values i safety ii trust iii environmental leadership iv teamwork and v high performance the principles by which we work and live our vision and values drive our company strategy which is centered on five central themes 

 in 2017 we issued our fourth biennial corporate responsibility report covering our performance in 2015 to 2016 our first report was issued in 2011 making us the first large water services company to measure its performance against the global reporting index in addition our sustainability practices have supported our inclusion in the dow jones sustainability north america index in 2012 2013 and 2015 and we have also maintained our position in the euronext vigeo ®  us 50 index which includes the 50 most advanced companies in the nation with respect to their environmental social and governance performance based on a review of hundreds of indicators 

highlights of our commitment to our esg policies and practices many of which are detailed in our most recent corporate responsibility report are summarized below

   social responsibility 



 governance 



research and development 

our research and development program 

we maintain an industryleading research and development “rd” program that is designed to enhance our services help ensure compliance and improve quality and operational effectiveness our rd personnel are located in new jersey and illinois the latter housing our quality control and testing laboratory which supports our rd activities through testing and analysis approximately onethird of our research budget is funded by competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers i n   2017  we spent 3 million  on research in total including 1 million  funded by grants spending on research amounted to 4 million  including 1 million  funded by grants in each of 2016  and 2015  

we continue to leverage the company’s expertise and collaborate with the epa to help establish effective environmental health and safety and water quality standards and regulation this relationship includes the sharing of our research such as our treatment and distribution system optimization research and our and national water quality monitoring data our engagement with the epa provides us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements we also frequently engage with the centers for disease control and other state environmental agencies we believe that continued rd activities are critical for providing safe reliable and affordable services as well as maintaining our leadership position in the industry which provides us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

emerging contaminants 

emerging contaminants include chemicals such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides herbicides and endocrine disrupting compounds which have been detected in drinking water supplies for which the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood andor has not been quantified while these contaminants have been present in our drinking water for as long as they have been in use technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them the ability to detect contaminants even at trace levels has raised questions among regulators and government agencies further affecting the public’s perception of drinking water quality 

the chemicals abstract service registry contains over 130 million registered chemicals with a new substance being produced approximately every 3 seconds from chemical breakdown and reformation we are continually investigating new substances and contaminants employing a team of scientists engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to our water supply to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories and to research the influx of advanced treatment technologies we maintain stateoftheart water quality testing equipment and implement new and emerging technologies to help predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues examples of our efforts include

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business operations 

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation by state pucs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our utility operations also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these regulatory requirements 

our regulated businesses  provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to economic regulation by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to 

 approval of the pucs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations some state pucs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations our utilities are also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the pucs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business 

in any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the level estimated in establishing rates 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations including with respect to emerging contaminants compliance with which could impact our operating costs and violations of which could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs as well as damage to our reputation 

our water and wastewater operations and the operations of our marketbased businesses  are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include cercla the clean water act and the safe drinking water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations for example cercla authorizes the epa to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations 

in addition state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our regulated businesses through customer rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses  would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

attention is being given to emerging contaminants including without limitation chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances examples of sources of emerging contaminants include but are not limited to newly created chemical compounds including for example perfluorinated compounds and manufactured nanomaterials human and veterinary products microbes viruses amoebae and other pathogens and residual byproducts of disinfection we rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants our role is to meet or surpass those standards when established in some of our states pucs may disapprove of cost recovery in whole or in part for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard furthermore given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created andor discovered we may not be able to detect andor mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system or supplies which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation in addition we believe emerging contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future which could significantly increase the cost of our operations 

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water 

for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 20 2009 cease and desist order the “2009 order” as amended by an order in july 2016 the “2016 order” of the swrcb that requires cal am to significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule that terminates on december 31 2021 the “2021 deadline” we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act we cannot predict whether cal am will be able to secure alternative sources of water or if cal am will be exposed to liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2021 deadline under the 2009 order and the 2016 order if cal am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected see item 3—legal proceedings —alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions which includes additional information regarding this matter 

the current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay also known as “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business 

there is typically a delay known as “regulatory lag” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory policies for example ten of our state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates furthermore in setting rates nine of our state pucs allow us to use future test years which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the rate case application process 

while these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs furthermore pucs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form or at all although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected 

changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions including without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax laws can materially affect our operations results of operations and cash flows the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others 

 any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

in addition new federal state and local laws changes in existing laws rules or regulations or administrative interpretations thereof could impact us on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 as of january 1 2018 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including continuation of interest expense deductibility the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income taxes the enactment of the tcja required a remeasurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017 results of operations and financial position we have assumed that the predominant majority of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our utility subsidiaries will remain subject to a normalization method of accounting pursuant to the us tax code or applicable puc regulations and that we will be able to deduct for us federal corporate income tax purposes substantially all of our interest expense based upon our interpretation of us tax law debt allocation methodologies  at the tcja’s 21 corporate tax rate the adoption or issuance of any related interpretations that impact these assumptions or with respect to provisions related specifically to the public utility industry or to corporate taxpayers in general may also impact our future financial performance including our results of operations cash flows and liquidity which impacts will largely be determined through future regulatory proceedings all of our 14 jurisdictions subject to economic regulation have opened formal proceedings related to the tcja and we have open rate cases in three of them at this time we cannot predict the impacts of any related interpretations if and when issued on us or the regulatory treatment of the tcja in each of our regulatory jurisdictions moreover we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts if any of any other new or amended laws rules or regulations or interpretations thereof to the extent they may be ultimately enacted adopted or issued on us or our businesses financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions climate variability patterns or natural disasters may disrupt our operations or reduce the demand for our water services which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service interruptions due to severe weather climate variability patterns and other natural events are possible across all our businesses these include among other things storms freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes landslides wildfires coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains severe electrical storms and solar flares weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage tariffs in place or cost recovery proceedings with respect to our regulated businesses may not provide reimbursement to us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas governmental restrictions imposed in response to a drought may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system as examples drought conditions had persisted in california over a fiveyear period and had been declared in new jersey in 2016 in 2017 these droughts were declared concluded but other droughts that may occur from time to time may result in the imposition of voluntary or mandatory water use targets rationing restrictions water conservation regulations and requirements to minimize water system leaks while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant puc determines they were reasonable and prudent we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will in fact be fully recovered moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

climate variability may cause increased volatility in weather and may impact water usage and related revenue or require additional expenditures all of which may not be fully recoverable in rates or otherwise 

the issue of climate variability is receiving increasing attention worldwide some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future associated with climate variability many climate variability predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities such as 



 because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate variability we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity although some or all potential expenditures and costs with respect to our regulated businesses could be recovered through rates infrastructure replacement surcharges or other regulatory mechanisms there can be no assurance that state pucs would authorize rate increases to enable us to recover such expenditures and costs in whole or in part 

a loss of one or more large industrial customers could have a material adverse impact upon the results of operations of one or more of our regulated businesses 

adverse economic conditions or other factors can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage by that customer in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions affecting these industrial customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations tariffs in place with respect to our regulated businesses may not reimburse us in whole or in part for any of these impacts 

our regulated businesses  require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment and to improve aging infrastructure in 2017  we invested 14 billion  in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems will likely increase in the future we expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt we may not be able to access our revolving credit facility or the commercial paper longterm debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all if we are not able to obtain sufficient financing we could be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

seasonality could adversely affect the volume of water sold and our revenues 

the volume of water we sell during the warmer months typically in the summer is generally greater than during other months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months the volume of water sold tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the amount of water we sell may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

three of our jurisdictions california illinois and new york have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit us to collect state pucauthorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period revenue stability mechanisms are designed to allow utilities to recover the fixed cost of operations while supporting water conservation goals in those jurisdictions that have not adopted a revenue stability mechanism operating results could continue to be affected by seasonality 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve environmental risks if collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

contamination of water supplies or our water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reductions in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions damage to our reputation and private litigation 

the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system or the water service that is provided to our customers may be subject to contamination including among other items contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate methyl tertiary butyl ether lead and other materials chemical spills or other accidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks in addition new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water treatment industry if one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 continuing limited use of the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply if service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through the expansion of our current treatment facilities or the development of new treatment methods we may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance customer rates tariffs or contract terms any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies 

in this regard on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances into the elk river near the west virginiaamerican water company “wvawc” treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia on september 21 2017 the us district court for the southern district of west virginia granted preliminary approval of a settlement class and proposed global class action settlement the “settlement” of claims involving wvawc and its affiliates arising out of the freedom industries chemical spill under the terms of the settlement wvawc has agreed that it will not seek rate recovery from the public service commission of west virginia the “psc” for the amounts paid by wvawc net of insurance recoveries under the settlement see item 3—legal proceedings —west virginia elk river freedom industries chemical spill which includes additional information regarding this matter 

since we engage in the business of providing water service to our customers contamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers could result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur and we may not be protected from these claims or negative impacts therefrom in whole or in part by tariffs or other contract terms negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water or water supplies in addition insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses and are subject to deductibles and other limitations pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations as well as the operations of our marketbased businesses  our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make generally our insurance policies cover property damage worker’s compensation employer’s liability general liability terrorism risks and automobile liability each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims as a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are selfinsured 

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles 

we are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions 

water and wastewater utilities including our regulated subsidiaries and our marketbased businesses  have a large direct and indirect customer base and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of their water wastewater and related or ancillary services the quality of water provided and the amount timeliness accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies state pucs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view us in a favorable light and may cause us to be susceptible to less favorable legislative regulatory and economic outcomes as well as increased regulatory or other oversight and more stringent regulatory or economic requirements unfavorable regulatory and economic outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations and less favorable economic terms in our agreements related to our marketbased businesses  as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on us and our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

the properties of our regulated businesses  segment include 80  dams a failure of any of which could result in personal injury and downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs although in most cases the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future the inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments 

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems which involves risks including competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers that may hinder or limit our ability to grow our business 

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we may not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and other buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 

the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in among other things 



 some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions 

our regulated businesses  are subject to condemnation and other proceedings through eminent domain or other similar authorized process which could materially and adversely affect their results of operations and financial condition 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses  operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process should a municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition we may resist the acquisition 

furthermore the law in certain jurisdictions in which our regulated businesses  operate including for example california provide for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to seek just compensation against a public utility if the public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property in these actions the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently these actions have occurred in connection with events such as floods mudslides and debris flow broken water mains landslides and wild and brush fires 

contesting an exercise of condemnation eminent domain or other similar process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management of affected regulated businesses  from the operation of those businesses moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation eminent domain or other process may not be successful which may require us to sell the operations at issue in a condemnation proceeding or to pay a private property owner compensation for the property damage suffered if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses  through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant charges any of these outcomes may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and liquidity 

we rely on technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our technology systems particularly our operational technology and it systems are an integral part of our business and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations for example we depend on these systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage certain plant operations and construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections these systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers 

although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure or cybersecurity incidents than other similar organizations our operational technology and it systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from 



 these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer employee or financial data security breaches misappropriation and other adverse consequences in addition a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency 

we may be subject to physical andor cyber attacks 

as operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical andor cyber attacks our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes our operational technology and it systems throughout our businesses may be vulnerable to unauthorized access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties while we have instituted certain safeguards to protect our operational technology and it systems those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities we cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack 

if despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred our operations could be disrupted property damaged and customer and other confidential information lost or stolen experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss suffer a loss of management time attention and resources from our regular business operations and be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows these types of events either impacting our facilities or the industry in general could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs losses resulting from a physical or cyber attack against us or our operations or assets may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage provided by applicable insurance policies 

in addition in the ordinary course of business we collect and retain sensitive information including personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in many cases we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks any theft loss andor fraudulent use of customer employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation liability and costs as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators among others 

our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational technology and it systems or implement new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks or the implementation of new systems may require substantial amounts of management’s time and financial resources to complete and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors including employees’ ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system we continue to implement technology to improve our business processes and customer interactions and have installed new and upgraded existing technology systems these efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to improve our operations and enhance our customer service capabilities any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting we may also experience difficulties integrating current systems with new or upgraded systems which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls business and operations we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated and any such impacts could harm our business individually or collectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our business has inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we may experience workforce injuries or loss of life and be exposed to financial losses including penalties and other liabilities 

our safety record is critical to our reputation we maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers contractors vendors and the public although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries it is extremely difficult to avoid accidents at all times 

our business sites including construction and maintenance sites often put our employees contractors and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment moving vehicles pressurized water underground trenches and vaults chemicals and other regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others our employees contractors and others may be injured or die unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover expose us to litigation and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our operations can involve the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly handled stored or disposed of could subject us to penalties or other liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

as of december 31 2017  approximately 46  of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 76  collective bargaining agreements in place with 19  different unions representing our unionized employees these collective bargaining agreements including 35  which expired in 2017  and 20  which will expire during 2018  are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation moreover our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions that represent employees in our regulated businesses expires on july 31 2018 and will be renegotiated during 2018 we may not be able to successfully renew or renegotiate these labor contracts on terms that are fair to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may disrupt our operations and result in higher labor costs which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel 

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers licensed operators water quality and other operating and craft personnel and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel 

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

financial and marketrelated risks 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2017  our aggregate longterm and shortterm debt balance including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 77 billion  and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 



in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new shortterm and longterm debt securities moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2018  2019  and 2020  will be 322 million  170 million  and 51 million  respectively we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all moreover if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

in an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixedrate debt we have entered into and in the future may enter into financial derivative instruments including without limitation interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  however these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we will depend primarily on cash flows from operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative including tax initiatives and reforms and other similar legislation or regulation regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 

our inability to access the capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external sources of shortterm liquidity are our 16 billion  commercial paper program and our 175 billion  revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility expires in accordance with its terms in june 2020 we regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2017  american water capital corp “awcc” our wholly owned financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had 905 million  of commercial paper outstanding and 84 million  in outstanding letters of credit there can be no assurance that awcc will be able to continue to access its commercial paper program or its revolving credit facility when as and if desired or that the amount of capital available thereunder will be sufficient to meet all of our liquidity needs at a reasonable or any cost 

under the terms of our revolving credit facility our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70 of our consolidated capitalization as determined under the terms of the credit facility if our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable to avoid such a default a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility 

our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties including events beyond our control for example events that could cause a reduction in equity include without limitation a significant writedown of our goodwill even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our stockholders to complete 

disruptions in the capital markets or changes in our credit ratings could also limit our ability to access capital on terms favorable to us or at all while the lending banks that participate in our revolving credit facility have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments these or other occurrences may cause our lenders to not meet their existing commitments and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan or debt markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty including as a result of changes in us tax and other laws reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital debt or credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures 

any of the foregoing events that impede our access to the capital markets or the failure of any of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

american water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to american water 

american water is a holding company and as such american water has no operations of its own substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries american water’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends to american water or repay indebtedness to american water prior to paying dividends to american water american water’s regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and covenants and other agreements made or entered into by american water and its subsidiaries american water’s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends to american water a failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on american water’s liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations 

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2017  we had us federal and state nol carryforwards of approximately 105 billion  and 322 million  respectively and management believes it is more likely than not that these nol carryforwards will be recovered in the future with the enactment of the tcja the company analyzed the impacts of the reduction in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 on the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities including its nol carryforwards and as a result remeasured those nol carryforwards as of the date of enactment of the tcja based on this tax rate change 

our federal nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028  and our state nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 through 2037 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our state nol carryforwards and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income 

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover adoption of related interpretations with respect to the tcja and other changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of our nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include 14 billion  of goodwill at december 31 2017  the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 and the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and to a lesser extent the acquisition of keystone in 2015 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business these market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or with respect to keystone fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the marcellus and utica shale regions served by keystone a prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our current or future forecasts of operating results cash flows or key assumptions a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization the effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet the expectations of our regulators 

market conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the sec the financial accounting standards board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies these changes are beyond our control can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure 

our internal controls accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap taxation requirements federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us such compliance permits us to among other things disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities tax and other laws and regulations 

we have implemented corporate governance internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” and relevant sec rules as well as other applicable regulations such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and board of directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws rules and regulations management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls while we believe these controls policies practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting the consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition the inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also increase financing costs or could also adversely affect our or awcc’s ability to access the capital markets 

additional risks related to our marketbased businesses   

we excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our marketbased businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients and these clients may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased businesses  do not satisfy these obligations 

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased businesses  including financial guarantees or deposits in the event our marketbased businesses  fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

at december 31 2017  we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 36 billion  and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased businesses  expand the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 

awe’s operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the us government 

we enter into contracts with the us government for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems which contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

moreover entering into contracts with the us government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations we are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which are complex and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

awe operates a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and faces the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems which may negatively affect awe as the operator of the systems 

awe operates a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts awe operates the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements in some cases awe may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on awe as the operator of the system and us and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to us to the same extent as if we were the owner 

awe’s marketbased businesses  are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received 

some of awe’s marketbased businesses  enter into longterm contracts under which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee these marketbased businesses  are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

keystone’s operations may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters 

keystone’s operations and the operation generally of natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities by keystone’s customers are subject to stringent federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection these provisions may require the acquisition by keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers prohibit the release of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may result from these operations failure to comply with these laws rules regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs to keystone the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities under existing environmental laws and regulations keystone could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed while we have structured and maintained our ownership and control of keystone’s operations in such a way that we believe should insulate the company its regulated subsidiaries and its other marketbased businesses  from any liabilities associated with keystone’s operations including liabilities for environmental matters there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the company from incurring liability for the operations of keystone 

changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes to these or other laws governing the natural gas and oil exploration industry that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could require keystone to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance with such requirements may harm keystone’s business and results of operations by reducing the demand for keystone’s water and related services and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on keystone’s competitive position financial condition results of operations and cash flows

legal proceedings 

tableend alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

under the 2009 order cal am is required among other things to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule the 2009 order responded to claims that cal am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the carmel river as required by a 1995 swrcb order in july 2016 at the request of cal am and several monterey county government agencies the swrcb issued the 2016 order approving a fiveyear extension of the deadline to comply with the 2009 order to december 31 2021 in november 2016 the water ratepayers association of the monterey peninsula a citizens’ advocacy group filed an action in sacramento county superior court against the swrcb and its board members and naming cal am as the real party in interest seeking to reverse the extension of the 2009 order to rescind the designation by the california public utilities commission the “cpuc” of cal am as the public utility water provider to the monterey peninsula and to appoint a receiver to oversee cal am’s compliance with the 2009 order with ultimate transfer to a public entity in may 2017 cal am and the swrcb filed demurrers to the action and on june 12 2017 the court entered an order sustaining those demurrers and dismissing the action with prejudice 

regional desalination project litigation 

the regional desalination project the “rdp” involved the construction of a desalination facility in the city of marina north of monterey the rdp was intended to among other things eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under the 2009 order in december 2010 the cpuc approved the rdp which was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cal am in 2011 due to a conflict of interest concerning a former member of mcwra’s board of directors mcwra stated that the agreements were void and as a result cal am terminated the agreements in april 2015 the cpuc approved a settlement agreement among cal am mcwra and the county of monterey to resolve these matters among the parties signing the agreement in march 2016 the supreme court of california granted mcwd’s petition for review of the cpuc approval and following the court’s disposition of a related issue in another case mcwd’s petition for review of the cpucapproved settlement agreement was remanded to the cpuc and remains pending 

in october 2012 cal am filed a complaint for declaratory relief against mcwra and mcwd which was ultimately transferred to the san francisco county superior court seeking a determination as to whether the agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest in june 2015 the court entered a final judgment agreeing with cal am’s position that four of the five agreements are void and one the credit line agreement is not void in november 2016 the supreme court of california denied mcwd’s final appeal of this judgment which allows further proceedings to determine the amount of damages that may be awarded in the proceeding 

in july 2015 cal am and mcwra filed a complaint in san francisco county superior court against mcwd and rmc water and environment “rmc” a private engineering consulting firm seeking to recover compensatory damages in excess of 10 million associated with the failure of the rdp as well as punitive and treble damages statutory penalties and attorneys’ fees shortly thereafter complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court by mcwd and rmc against cal am and mcwra in excess of 19 million in the aggregate in december 2015 the court consolidated all of these complaints into a single action and trial in this matter has been scheduled for june 18 2018 on december 21 2017 rmc filed a motion for summary judgment and a hearing on such motion is scheduled for march 15 2018 on december 6 2017 mcwd filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and a hearing on such motion took place on february 2 2018 on february 5 2018 the court dismissed cal am’s and mcwra’s tort law claims against mcwd and allowed cal am leave to amend its breach of contract claims against mcwd the court’s decision does not impact cal am’s and mcwra’s tort claims against rmc cal am and mcwra were given until february 19 2018 to amend their breach of contract claims cal am and mcwra are considering their responses to the order including an appeal to the california court of appeal 

monterey peninsula water supply project 

the water supply project is intended to reduce water diversions from the carmel river and involves construction of a desalination plant owned by cal am and purchase of water by cal am from a groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” between the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the mpwmd cal am’s ability to move forward on the water supply project is subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc and other government agencies obtaining necessary permits and intervention from other parties on january 12 2017 the cpuc issued a draft environmental impact reportenvironmental impact statement a final report is expected at the end of the first quarter of 2018 

on september 15 2016 the cpuc unanimously approved a decision to authorize cal am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the gwr project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to 50 million in associated costs subject to meeting certain criteria if construction costs exceed 50 million cal am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery 

a preliminary step to building the water supply project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under monterey bay in november 2014 the california coastal commission the “coastal commission” approved coastal development permits for the test slant well enabling cal am to construct and operate the test slant well the permits would have expired on february 28 2018 at which time cal am would have been required to decommission the test slant well but because cal am could use the test slant well as one of the slant wells for the water supply project it sought an amendment of its coastal development permits to allow the test slant well to remain in place and be maintained on site until february 28 2019 the coastal commission approved the permit amendment on december 13 2017 the required lease obtained from the california state lands commission the “state lands commission” as amended after a twoyear extension granted on november 29 2017 is to expire on december 16 2019 

on july 13 2017 the coastal commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property on which intake wells will be located to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a nonprofit or governmental entity the consent agreement strictly limits future use of the property but preserves cal am’s existing property rights and allows uses consistent with existing easements and other rights of record 

the cpuc held hearings from october 25 through november 3 2017 on cal am’s request for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the water supply project this request remains pending 

in december 2014 the mcwd and the ag land trust an agricultural land conservancy filed petitions against the coastal commission and cal am which were ultimately transferred to the santa cruz county superior court seeking to vacate the coastal commission’s approval of the coastal development permit and to permanently restrain cal am and the coastal commission from constructing the test slant well pending full compliance with the california environmental quality act and the california coastal act the court denied these petitions and on january 11 2017 the supreme court of california denied mcwd’s petition for review of this decision mcwd filed a similar petition in january 2015 against the state lands commission and cal am which remains pending 

in november 2015 mcwd filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in santa cruz county superior court against the coastal commission and cal am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test well pumping in september 2016 the court denied mcwd’s petition with respect to all claims except claims related to those raised in the december 2014 petitions discussed above on october 3 2017 after conducting a trial for all matters raised in mcwd’s november 2015 challenge other than claims that had been denied by the court in september 2016 the court denied mcwd’s claims with respect to these matters on january 12 2018 mcwd filed a notice of appeal of the court’s judgment 

based on the foregoing cal am estimates that the earliest date by which the water supply project desalination plant could be completed is sometime in 2021 there can be no assurance that cal am’s application for the water supply project will be approved or that the water supply project will be completed on a timely basis if ever furthermore there can be no assurance that cal am will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order and the 2016 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to cal am or the company 

california public utilities commission residential rate design proceeding 

in december 2016 the cpuc issued a final decision in a proceeding involving cal am adopting a new residential rate design for cal am’s monterey district the decision allowed for recovery by cal am of 32 million in undercollections in the water revenue adjustment mechanismmodified cost balancing account “wrammcba” over a fiveyear period plus interest and modified existing conservation and rationing plans in its decision the cpuc noted concern regarding cal am’s residential tariff administration specifically regarding the lack of verification of customerprovided information about the number of residents per household this information was used for generating billing determinants under the tiered rate system as a result the cpuc kept this proceeding open to address several issues including whether cal am’s residential tariff administration violated a statute rule or cpuc decision and if so whether a penalty should be imposed 

on february 24 2017 cal am the mpwmd the cpuc’s office of ratepayer advocates and the coalition of peninsula businesses filed for cpuc approval of a joint settlement agreement the “joint settlement agreement” which among other things proposed to resolve the cpuc’s residential tariff administration concerns by providing for a waiver by cal am of 05 million of cost recovery for residential customers through the wrammcba in lieu of a penalty approval of the joint settlement agreement which is required for it to take effect remains pending before the cpuc 

on march 28 2017 the administrative law judge assigned to the proceeding issued a ruling stating there was sufficient evidence to conclude on a preliminary basis that cal am’s administration of the residential tariff violated certain provisions of the california public utilities code and a cpuc decision the ruling ordered cal am to show cause why it should not be penalized for these administrative violations and directed the settling parties to address whether the cost recovery waiver in the joint settlement agreement was reasonable compared to a potential penalty range described by the administrative law judge during hearings held on april 1314 2017 the administrative law judge clarified that this potential penalty range is 3 million to 179 million calculated as a continuing violation dating back to 2000 and applying penalties of up to 20000 per day until january 1 2012 and penalties of up to 50000 per day thereafter reflecting a 2012 change to the relevant statute the administrative law judge also noted that a per diem penalty may not be appropriate as cal am’s monthly billing practices did not allow cal am to update customerprovided information for billing purposes on a daily basis hearings before the administrative law judge in this matter were held in august september and november 2017 cal am also submitted additional testimony on the issue of whether cal am should be penalized and if so the reasonable amount of any such penalty this proceeding remains pending and the cpuc has set a statutory deadline of september 30 2018 for the completion of the proceeding 

west virginia elk river freedom industries chemical spill 

background 

on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances 4methylcyclohexane methanol “mchm” and pphdipph a mix of polyglycol ethers into the elk river near the wvawc treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia after having been alerted to the leak of mchm by the west virginia department of environmental protection wvawc took immediate steps to gather more information about mchm augment its treatment process as a precaution and begin consultations with federal state and local public health officials as soon as possible after it was determined that the augmented treatment process would not fully remove the mchm a joint decision was reached in consultation with the west virginia bureau for public health to issue a “do not use” order for all of its approximately 93000 customer accounts in parts of nine west virginia counties served by the charleston treatment plant by january 18 2014 none of wvawc’s customers were subject to the do not use order 

following the freedom industries chemical spill numerous lawsuits were filed against wvawc and certain other companyaffiliated entities collectively the “american water defendants” with respect to this matter in the us district court for the southern district of west virginia or west virginia circuit courts in kanawha boone and putnam counties and to date more than 70  cases remain pending four of the cases pending before the us district court were consolidated for purposes of discovery and an amended consolidated class action complaint for those cases the “federal action” was filed in december 2014 by several plaintiffs in january 2016 all of the thenfiled state court cases were referred to west virginia’s mass litigation panel for further proceedings which have been stayed until april 22 2018 pending the approval by the court in the federal action of a global agreement to settle all of such cases as described below the court in the federal action has continued the start of the trial indefinitely pending ongoing settlement approval activities 

proposed global class action settlement 

in october 2016 the court in the federal action approved the preliminary principles terms and conditions of a binding global agreement in principle to settle claims among the american water defendants and all class members putative class members claimants and potential claimants arising out of the freedom industries chemical spill on april 27 2017 the parties filed with the court in the federal action a proposed settlement agreement providing details of the terms of the settlement of these matters and requesting that the court in the federal action grant preliminary approval of such settlement on july 6 2017 the court in the federal action issued an opinion denying without prejudice the joint motion for preliminary approval of the settlement on august 25 2017 the parties filed a proposed amended settlement agreement and related materials addressing the matters set forth in the july 6 2017 order 

on september 21 2017 the court in the federal action issued an order granting preliminary approval of a settlement class and proposed class action settlement the “settlement” with respect to claims against the american water defendants by all putative class members collectively the “plaintiffs” for all claims and potential claims arising out of the freedom industries chemical spill the settlement proposes a global resolution of all federal and state litigation and potential claims against the american water defendants and their insurers under the terms and conditions of the settlement and the proposed amended settlement agreement the american water defendants have not admitted and will not admit any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the plaintiffs in any of the actions to be resolved under federal class action rules claimants had the right until december 8 2017 to elect to opt out of the final settlement in which case such claimant would not receive any benefit from or be bound by the terms of the settlement as of january 31 2018 less than 100 of the 225000 estimated putative plaintiffs have submitted optout notices the deadline to file a claim in the settlement is february 21 2018 

the proposed aggregate pretax amount of the settlement with respect to the company is  126 million  the aggregate portion of the settlement to be contributed by wvawc net of insurance recoveries is  43 million  approximately  26 million  aftertax taking into account the september 2017 settlement with one of the company’s general liability insurance carriers discussed below another defendant to the settlement is to contribute up to  25 million  to the settlement two of the company’s general liability insurance carriers which provide an aggregate of  50 million  in insurance coverage to the company under these policies had been originally requested to participate in the settlement at the time of the initial filing of the binding agreement in principle with the court in the federal action but did not agree to do so at that time wvawc filed a lawsuit against one of these carriers alleging that the carrier’s failure to agree to participate in the settlement constituted a breach of contract on september 19 2017 the company and the insurance carrier settled this lawsuit for  22 million  out of a maximum of 25 million in potential coverage under the terms of the relevant policy in exchange for a full release by the company and wvawc of all claims against the insurance carrier related to the freedom industries chemical spill wvawc and the settling insurer have agreed to stay this litigation pending final approval of the settlement the company and wvawc continue to pursue vigorously their rights to insurance coverage for contributions by wvawc to the settlement in mandatory arbitration with the remaining nonparticipating carrier this arbitration proceeding remains pending despite these efforts the company may not ultimately be successful in obtaining full or further reimbursement under this insurance policy for amounts that wvawc may be required to contribute to the settlement 

the proposed settlement would establish a twotier settlement fund for the payment of claims comprised of i a simple claim fund which is also referred to as the “guaranteed fund” of  76 million  of which  29 million  will be contributed by wvawc including insurance deductibles and  47 million  would be contributed by two of the company’s general liability insurance carriers and ii an individual review claim fund of up to  50 million  of which up to  14 million  would be contributed by wvawc and up to  36 million  would be contributed by a number of the company’s general liability insurance carriers separately up to  25 million  would be contributed to the guaranteed fund by another defendant to the settlement if any final approval order by the court in the federal action with respect to the settlement is appealed and such appeal would delay potential payment to claimants under the settlement wvawc and the other defendant to the settlement will contribute up to  50 million  and  25 million  respectively to the settlement not including in the case of wvawc any contributions by the company’s general liability insurance carriers which would not be made until such time as a final nonappealable order is issued into an escrow account during the pendency of such appeals for certain claims wvawc and the other defendant to the settlement may in lieu of these escrowed contributions make advance payments of such claims if agreed to by the parties all administrative expenses of the settlement and attorneys’ fees of class counsel related thereto would be paid from the funds designated to pay claims covered by the settlement 

as a result of these events in the third quarter of 2016 the company recorded a charge to earnings net of insurance receivables of  65 million   39 million  aftertax additionally in the third quarter of 2017 the company recorded a benefit of  22 million   13 million  aftertax as an additional insurance receivable reflecting the settlement with the insurance carrier described above the company intends to fund wvawc’s contributions to the settlement through existing sources of liquidity although no contribution by wvawc will be required unless and until the terms of the settlement are finally approved by the court in the federal action furthermore under the terms of the settlement wvawc has agreed that it will not seek rate recovery from the psc for approximately  4 million  in direct response costs expensed in 2014 by wvawc relating to the freedom industries chemical spill as well as for amounts paid by wvawc under the settlement 

the company’s insurance policies operate under a layered structure where coverage is generally provided in the upper layers after claims have exhausted lower layers of coverage the  36 million  to be contributed by a number of the company’s general liability insurance carriers to the individual review claim fund as noted above is from higher layers of the insurance structure than the insurance carrier that was requested but presently has not agreed to participate in the settlement any recovery by wvawc or the company from the remaining nonparticipating carrier would reimburse wvawc for its contributions to the guaranteed fund

overview 

american water is the largest and most geographically diverse publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the united states as measured by both operating revenues and population served we employ approximately 6900  professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to an estimated 15 million  people in 46  states the district of columbia and ontario canada our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial public authority fire service and sale for resale customers collectively presented as our “ regulated businesses ” our utilities operate in 16  states and serve approximately 34 million  customers based on the number of active service connections to our water and wastewater networks our regulated businesses  are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation collectively referred to as pucs we also operate marketbased businesses within four operating segments providing a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services to military bases municipalities oil and gas exploration and production companies as well as commercial industrial and residential customers individually these four  operating segments do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” and are collectively presented as our marketbased businesses  which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses 

2017  financial results 

the following table provides highlights of our diluted earnings per share and our adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure 



for the year ended december 31 2017  net income attributable to common stockholders was 238  per diluted share a decrease of 024  per diluted share or 92  as c ompared to the prior year   included in the 2017  amount was i an aftertax benefit of 13 million  or 007  per diluted share resulting from an insurance settlement with one of our general liability insurance carriers related to the freedom industries chemical spill ii an aftertax charge of 4 million  or 002  per diluted share resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company and iii a noncash aftertax remeasurement charge of 125 million  or 070  per diluted share resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of the tcja on december 22 2017 included in the 2016 amounts was an aftertax charge of 39 million  or 022  per diluted share resulting from the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill for additional information see item 3—legal proceedings—west virginia elk river freedom industries chemical spill 

excluding these items adjusted diluted earnings per share a nongaap measure was 303  for the year ended december 31 2017  an increase of 019  per diluted share or 67  as compared to the prior year this increase was primarily due to continued growth in our   regulated businesses  largely driven by infrastructure investment acquisitions and organic growth combined with growth in our   marketbased businesses   from our homeowner services group and keystone  these increases were partially offset by lower water services demand in 2017 in our   regulated businesses  attributable in part to overall warmer weather in 2016 as well as lower capital upgrades in our military services group for further discussion of our consolidated results of operations as well as financial results for our regulated businesses   segment and our   marketbased businesses  see “consolidated results of operations” and “segment results of operations” for additional information   

adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a nongaap financial measure and means diluted earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap excluding the impact of i the third quarter of 2017 insurance settlement related to the freedom industries chemical spill ii the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company in the third quarter of 2017 iii the noncash aftertax remeasurement charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company’s deferred income taxes from enactment of the tcja a nd iv   the fourth quarter of 2016 binding global agreement in principle to settle claims related to the freedom industries chemical spill we believe that this nongaap measure provides investors with useful information by excluding certain matters that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating results and that providing this nongaap measure will allow investors to understand better our businesses’ operating performance and facilitate a meaningful yeartoyear comparison of our results of operations although management uses this nongaap financial measure internally to evaluate our results of operations we do not intend results excluding the adjustments to represent results as defined by gaap and the reader should not consider them as indicators of performance this nongaap financial measure is derived from our consolidated financial information but is not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap and thus it should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this nongaap financial measure as defined and used above may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap measures used by other companies and accordingly it may have significant limitations on its use 

strategic focus and 2017  achievements 

we believe our success in the future will be driven by engaged employees smart investments and safe efficient operations leading to satisfied customers which in turn will lead to constructive regulatory outcomes and sustainable financial performance our strategy which is driven by our vision and core values will continue to be anchored on our five central themes 





 the following chart depicts the estimated allocation of our expected capital investment for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses  from 2018  to 2022  by purpose 

 our adjusted om efficiency ratio is defined as our regulated operation and maintenance expenses divided by our regulated operating revenues where both operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense additionally from operation and maintenance expenses we have excluded the allocable portion of nonoperation and maintenance support services costs mainly depreciation and general taxes that are reflected in our regulated businesses  segment as operation and maintenance expenses but for consolidated financial reporting purposes are categorized within other line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  we have also excluded from operation and maintenance expenses the impact of certain freedom industries chemical spill settlement activities we excluded all of the above items from the calculation as we believe such items are not reflective of management’s ability to increase efficiency of our regulated operations going forward we expect changes to our adjusted om efficiency ratio related to the impact of the enactment of the tcja and the adoption of new accounting standards in the future 

we evaluate our operating performance using this ratio because we believe it directly measures improvement in the efficiency of our regulated operations this information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance our adjusted om efficiency ratio is not a gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures and should not be used in place of the gaap information provided elsewhere in this form 10k 

with respect to our adjusted om efficiency ratio goal for 2022 we are unable to provide without unreasonable efforts a quantitative reconciliation of each component of this ratio to the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap in calculating the components of the ratio certain items that may ultimately be excluded would be reflective of events that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time the unavailable information would include among other things the impact of items currently excluded from the calculation of the components adjustments for weather conditions that exceed a certain threshold of variability and adjustments for events or circumstances that may not be reflective of ongoing operating results the probable significance of these items is also presently unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated 

the following table provides the calculation of our adjusted om efficiency ratio and a reconciliation that compares operation and maintenance expenses and operating revenues each as determined in accordance with gaap to those amounts utilized in the calculation of our adjusted om efficiency ratio 





regulatory matters 

the following table provides general rate case authorizations effective from 2015  through 2017  and depicts annualized incremental revenues assuming a constant water sales volume

on april 3 2017  our california subsidiary filed an application requesting a cost of capital of 849  compared to 841 currently authorized on february 6 2018 a proposed decision was issued by the administrative law judge and we plan to work through the regulatory process with the cpuc over the next several months 

during the third quarter of 2016 our california subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting 35 million  in additional annualized revenues and an increase of 8 million  in the escalation year of 2019 and the attrition year of 2020 during the fourth quarter of 2016 our california subsidiary filed an update to its general rate case adjusting its request for additional annualized revenues to 32 million  and increasing its request to 9 million  in the escalation year of 2019 

a number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure 

the following table provides infrastructure surcharge authorizations effective from 2015  through 2017  and depicts annualized incremental revenues assuming a constant water sales volume 



 on december 28 2017  our west virginia subsidiary received a decision on its infrastructure surcharge filing authorizing additional annualized revenues of 3 million  effective on january 1 2018 additionally on december 20 2017  our illinois subsidiary filed for an infrastructure surcharge requesting 3 million  in additional annualized revenues which will become effective on january 1 2018 

there is no assurance that all or any portion of these requests will be granted 

pending infrastructure surcharge filings

there is no assurance that all or any portion of these requests will be granted 

other regulatory matters 

on august 4 2017 our illinois subsidiary filed a petition with the illinois commerce commission “icc” to place into effect revised depreciation rates applicable to our depreciable water and wastewater plant resulting from a new depreciation study the petition requested that these new rates would be effective january 1 2017 on november 21 2017 the icc approved this petition which resulted in lower depreciation expense of 16 million  in 2017 

tax matters 

tax cuts and jobs act 

on december 22 2017  the tcja was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  as of january 1 2018 and certain other provisions related specifically to the public utility industry including continuation of interest expense deductibility the exclusion from utilizing bonus depreciation and the normalization of deferred income tax the enactment of the tcja required a remeasurement of our deferred income taxes that materially impacted our 2017  results of operations and financial position the portion of this remeasurement related to our regulated businesses  was substantially offset by a regulatory liability as we believe it is probable that the deferred income tax excesses created by the tcja will be refunded to customers in future rates the remaining portion of this remeasurement of the net deferred income tax liability was recorded as a noncash charge to earnings of 125 million  during the fourth quarter of 2017 

other tax matters 

on april 11 2017 the state of new york enacted legislation that increased the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to new york this legislation eliminated the production of water as a qualified manufacturing activity in new york which effectively increased the state income tax rate in new york as a result of the legislative change we were required to remeasure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the higher state income tax rate in the second quarter of 2017 this change in legislation was the primary cause of an increase to our unitary deferred income tax liability of 11 million the portion of this increase related to our new york subsidiary calculated on a standalone basis was 7 million and was offset by a regulatory asset as we believe it is probable of recovery in future rates the remaining increase in the deferred income tax liability was calculated through state tax apportionment rates and recorded at the consolidated level resulting in a noncash cumulative charge to earnings of 4 million during the second quarter of 2017 

on july 7 2017 the state of illinois enacted legislation that increased effective july 1 2017 the state income tax rate on our taxable income attributable to illinois from 775 to 95 as a result of the legislative change we were required to remeasure our cumulative deferred income tax balances using the higher state income tax rate in the third quarter of 2017 this change in legislation was the primary cause of an increase to our unitary deferred income tax liability of 7 million the portion of this increase related to our illinois subsidiary calculated on a standalone basis was 4 million and was offset by a regulatory asset as we believe it is probable of recovery in future rates the remaining increase in the deferred income tax liability was recorded at the consolidated level resulting in a noncash cumulative charge to earnings of 3 million during the third quarter of 2017 

consolidated results of operations 

the following table presents our consolidated results of operations and the ensuing discussions provide explanations for the variances related to the major components 



operating revenues 

in 2017  operating revenues increased   55 million  or 17  primarily due to a 

 in 2016  operating revenues increased   143 million  or 45  primarily due to a 

 operation and maintenance 

in 2017  operation and maintenance expense decreased   126 million  or 84  primarily due to a 



 in 2016  operation and maintenance expense increased   100 million  or 71  primarily due to a 

 depreciation and amortization   

in 2017  and 2016  depreciation and amortization expense increased 22 million  and 30 million  or 47  and 68  respectively the increase for both periods was primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service included in 2017  was the impact of revised depreciation rates from a depreciation study approved by the icc in our illinois subsidiary resulting in lower depreciation expense of 16 million  included in 2016  was incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from our acquisition of keystone in the third quarter of 2015 

general taxes 

in 2017  and 2016  general taxes increased   1 million  and 15 million  or 04  and 62  respectively the increase in 2016  was primarily due to incremental property and gross receipts taxes in our regulated businesses  

gain on asset dispositions and purchases 

in 2017  and 2016  gain on asset dispositions and purchases increased   6 million  and 7 million  or 600  and 2333  respectively the increase in 2017  was primarily due to a 7 million gain recognized on a land sale in our kentucky subsidiary the increase in 2016  was largely attributable to a gains recognized on a land sale in our pennsylvania subsidiary and an acquisition in our missouri subsidiary 

other income expense 

in 2017  and 2016  other expenses increased   22 million  and 17 million  or 71  and 58  respectively the increase in 2017  was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from the issuance of incremental longterm debt in 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as a 6 million  charge resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company the increase in 2016  was largely attributable to an increase in interest expense from the issuance of incremental longterm debt as well as an increase in shortterm interest expense mainly due to higher levels of shortterm borrowings during 2016 coupled with an increase in the average shortterm borrowing rates in 2016 as compared to the prior year 

provision for income taxes 

in 2017  our provision for income taxes increased  by 184 million  or 609  from the previous year the increase is primarily due to higher pretax income and a noncash aftertax remeasurement charge of 125 million  resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of the tcja which included a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  the 125 million  charge includes 6 million  allocated to our regulated businesses  segment 5 million  to our marketbased businesses  and 114 million  to our other segment in 2016  our provision for income taxes decreased   4 million  or 13  from the previous year this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in pretax income the effective tax rates were 533  392 and 391  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

as of december 31 2017  we’ve recognized federal nol carryforwards of 105 billion  the tcja eliminated the bonus depreciation deduction for property acquired or constructed after september 27 2017 and we currently expect to utilize the benefits of our federal nol carryforwards over the next two years see note 13—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 segment results of operations 

our segments are determined based on how we assess performance and allocate resources we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources based on several factors with the primary measure being net income attributable to common stockholders the majority of our business is conducted through our regulated businesses  reportable segment we also operate several marketbased businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services within four  operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with gaap these four  nonreportable operating segments are collectively presented as our marketbased businesses  which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses

in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we through awcc our wholly owned financing subsidiary issue commercial paper which is supported by the revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017  awcc had no  outstanding borrowings and 84 million  of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility with 175 billion  available to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit which supported 905 million  in outstanding commercial paper we believe that our ability to access the capital markets our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our shortterm requirements we have no plans to issue equity under normal operating conditions in the foreseeable future with the limited exception of privately or investorowned acquisitions whose sellers require equity as necessary to complete the acquisition we believe we have sufficient liquidity and the ability to manage our expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets however we can provide no assurances that the lenders will meet their existing commitments to awcc under the revolving credit facility or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from our regulated businesses  rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based upon regulatory guidelines the taxability of advances and contributions in aid of construction was changed with the enactment of the tcja previously the majority of advances and contributions that we collected were not taxable however with the enactment of the tcja they will be taxable going forward regulatory treatment for advances and contributions under the tcja has not yet been defined and we are working with our regulatory jurisdictions to determine impacts to the company and our customers 

we use our capital resources including cash primarily to i fund operating and capital requirements ii pay interest and meet debt maturities iii pay dividends iv fund acquisitions and v fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations we invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where we expect to earn a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag see item 1—business — regulated businesses — economic regulation and rate making  we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greater than our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly if necessary we may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity in this event we believe we can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet our obligations and fund our minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

with the enactment of the tcja and the reduction of the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 we anticipate a decrease in future revenue authorizations associated with our regulated businesses  initially leading to lower cash flows we expect this cash flow impact to decline over time as our regulated businesses ’ rate base grows the result of lower deferred income tax liabilities which offset rate base the lower deferred income tax liabilities are mainly due to i a lower us federal corporate income tax rate ii the normalization refunding to customers of the remeasured deferred income tax liabilities over the remaining life of the associated assets and iii the loss of future bonus depreciation deductions on capital projects that began after september 27 2017 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

cash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the warmer months our future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by among other things economic utility regulation inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining customer usage of water employeerelated costs including pension funding weather and seasonality taxes and overall economic conditions 

we expect that the enactment of the tcja to be accretive to our consolidated earnings over time through i growth in rate base for the same level of expected capital expenditures due to the impact of the lower us federal corporate income tax rate and the remeasurement of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities ii increased earnings in our marketbased businesses  due to the lower us federal corporate income tax rate all partially offset by iii the impact of increased debt due to lower cash flows from operations we believe that we will likely begin paying federal income taxes towards the end of 2019 when we expect our federal nol carryforwards balance will be fully benefited or used and expect to be a full cash taxpayer by 2020 although this timing could be impacted by any significant changes in our future results of operations and the outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the tcja 

cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditure requirements we expect to seek access to debt capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed we also have access to equity capital markets if needed operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner as such our working capital needs are primarily limited to funding increases in customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues mainly associated with revenue increases in our regulated businesses  we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future sometimes our current liabilities exceed current assets because of our debt due within one year and the periodic use of shortterm debt as a funding source primarily to meet scheduled maturities of longterm debt as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business stage of our acquisitions and construction projects we address cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows provided by operating activities 



 in 2017  cash flows provided by operating activities increased   160 million  primarily due to an increase in net income after noncash adjustments including the impact of the enactment of the tcja and an increase in cash flows from working capital the main factors contributing to the net income increase are described in the “consolidated results of operations” section and include higher operating revenues partially offset by higher income taxes due to a 125 million  remeasurement charge resulting from the impact of the change in the federal tax rate on the company’s deferred income taxes from the enactment of the tcja the increase in noncash activities was mainly attributable to the increase in deferred income taxes as mentioned above and an increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service the change in working capital was principally due to i the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities including the accrual recorded during 2016 for the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia ii a decrease in unbilled revenues as a result of our military services group achieving significant capital project milestones during 2016 and iii a change in other current assets and liabilities including the decrease in other current assets associated with the termination of our four forward starting swap agreements and timing of payments clearing our cash accounts 

in 2016  cash flows provided by operations increased   94 million  primarily due to an increase in net income after noncash adjustments including the impact of the binding global agreement in principle to settle claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia and an increase in cash flows from working capital the main factors contributing to the net income increase are described in the “consolidated results of operations” section and include higher operating revenues partially offset by higher om expenses the increase in noncash activities was mainly attributable to an increase in depreciation and amortization due to additional utility plant placed in service the change in working capital was principally due to i a change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues resulting from continuous improvement in our regulated businesses ’ collection efforts as well as a decrease in unbilled revenues in our military services group attributable to lower capital upgrades in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 ii the timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and iii a change in other current assets and liabilities 

the company expects to make pension and postretirement contributions to the plan trusts up to 45 million  in 2018  in addition we estimate that contributions will amount to 47 million  47 million  51 million  and 58 million  in 2019  2020  2021  and 2022  respectively actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns among other factors 

cash flows used in investing activities 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affection our cash flows used in investing activities 



  

 in 2017  and 2016  cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in our regulated capital expenditures principally from incremental investments associated with the replacement and renewal of our transmission and distribution infrastructure in our regulated businesses  

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures related to the upgrading of our infrastructure and systems 



in 2017  our capital expenditures increased   123 million  or 94  primarily due to investment in our general structure and equipment and wastewater categories in 2016  our capital expenditures increased   151 million  or 130  principally due to investment across the majority of our infrastructure categories 

we also grow our business through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems as well as other waterrelated services these acquisitions are complementary to our existing business and support continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt 

the following provides a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities 

2017  

 2016  



 2015  

 as previously noted we expect to invest between 80 billion  to 86 billion  from 2018  to 2022  with 72 billion  of this range for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses  in 2018  we expect to invest between 16 billion  to 18 billion  with a range of 14 billion  to 15 billion  for infrastructure improvements in our regulated businesses  also in 2018  we expect to invest between 120 million  to 240 million  for acquisitions in our regulated businesses  and approximately 100 million  for strategic growth opportunities including the construction of our new corporate headquarters in camden new jersey which is expected to be completed during the second half of 2018 and is eligible for tax credits from new jersey’s economic development authority 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding infrastructure construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction net of refunds which amounted to 28 million  16 million  and 26 million  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively based on the needs of our regulated businesses  and the company awcc may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then through intercompany loans provide those borrowings to the regulated businesses  and the parent company the regulated businesses  and the parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations the parent company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated businesses  therefore the parent company is not able to recover the interest charges on its debt through regulated water and wastewater rates as of december 31 2017  awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to our regulated businesses  amounting to 39 billion  and 586 million  respectively additionally as of december 31 2017  awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the parent company amounting 16 billion  and 319 million  respectively 

on august 10 2017  awcc completed a 135 billion  debt offering which included the sale of 600 million  aggregate principal amount of its 295  senior notes due 2027 and 750 million  aggregate principal amount of its 375  senior notes due in 2047 at the closing of the offering awcc received after deduction of underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs 133 billion  on september 13 2017 awcc used proceeds from the offering to prepay 138 million  of its outstanding 562  series c senior notes due december 21 2018 “series c senior notes” and 181 million  of its outstanding 577  series d senior notes due december 21 2021 “series d senior notes” awcc also used the proceeds of this offering to repay commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes and subsequently on october 15 2017 to repay at maturity 524 million  of its 6085  senior notes 

as a result of awcc’s prepayment of the series c senior notes and the series d senior notes and payment of a makewhole premium amount to the holders thereof of 34 million  we recorded a 6 million  charge resulting from the early extinguishment of debt at the parent company substantially all of the early debt extinguishment costs allocable to the regulated businesses  were recorded as regulatory assets for we believe they are probable of recovery in future rates approximately 1 million  of the early debt extinguishment costs allocable to the regulated businesses  were amortized in 2017 

one of the principal market risks to which the company is exposed is changes in interest rates in order to manage the exposure we follow risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps we reduce exposure to interest rates by managing commercial paper and debt maturities we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments the derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations we minimize the counterparty credit risk on these transactions by only dealing with leading creditworthy financial institutions having longterm credit ratings of “a” or better 

on august 7 2017  coinciding with awcc’s 135 billion  debt offering we terminated four  existing forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 300 million  realizing a gain of 19 million  to be amortized through interest net over 30  years on february 8 2017 and december 11 2017 we entered into forward starting swap agreements each with notional amounts of 100 million  to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2018 these forward starting swap agreements terminate in november 2018 and have an average fixed rate of 259  we have designated these forward starting swap agreements as cash flow hedges with their fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss upon termination the cumulative gain or loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss will be amortized through interest net over the term of the new debt 

in october 2017 we terminated our interestrate swap to hedge 100 million  of its 6085   senior notes maturing in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company paid variable interest of sixmonth libor plus 3422  and had designated this interest rate swap as a fair value hedge accounted for at fair value with gains or losses as well as the offsetting gains or losses on the hedged item recognized in interest net the net gain and loss recognized by the company was de minimis for the periods ended december 31 2017  and 2016  

in may 2015 the parent company and awcc filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that enables us to meet our capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities including american water common stock preferred stock and other equity and hybrid securities and awcc debt securities all subject to market conditions and demand general economic conditions and as applicable rating status the shelf registration will expire in may 2018 during 2017  2016  and 2015  135 billion  550 million  and 550 million  respectively of debt securities were issued pursuant to this registration statements

 the following table details the longterm debt that was retired through sinking fund provisions optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2015  



  

 from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements through tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

in february 2015 our board of directors authorized an antidilutive common stock repurchase program to mitigate the effect of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities the program allows the company to purchase up to 10 million  shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions the program is conducted in accordance with rule 10b18 of the exchange act and to facilitate the repurchases we have also entered into rule 10b51 share repurchase plans with a thirdparty broker which allows us to repurchase shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods subject to applicable regulations we may elect to amend or cancel this repurchase program or the share repurchase parameters at our discretion as of december 31 2017  we have repurchased an aggregate of 3950000  shares of common stock under this program 

credit facilities and shortterm debt 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility of 175 billion  that expires in june 2020 in march 2016 and under the terms of the revolving credit agreement dated june 30 2015 awcc exercised its right to increase its borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility from the aggregate maximum of 125 billion to 175 billion  all other terms conditions and covenants with respect to the existing facility remained unchanged on june 30 2015 awcc and its lenders extended the termination date of the revolving credit facility from october 2018 to june 2020 this amended and restated agreement also allowed awcc to request to extend further the term of the credit facility for up to two oneyear periods an extension request must satisfy certain conditions and receive approval of the lenders as set forth in the revolving credit agreement 

interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the eurodollar rate or base rate in accordance with awcc’s thenapplicable moody investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services credit rating at current ratings that spread would be 090 the facility is used principally to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 150 million  in letters of credit indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between the company and awcc which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by the company of awcc’s payment obligations under the credit facility 

awcc also has an outstanding commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility the maximum aggregate outstanding amount of which was increased on march 22 2016 from 10 billion to 16 billion  

keystone has its own line of credit facility with a maximum availability of up to 12 million  the actual amount of which is determined pursuant to a collateral base calculation borrowings under this facility are payable upon demand with interest being paid monthly interest accrues each day at a rate per annum equal to 275 above the greater of the one month or one day libor the borrowing base under the facility allows for financing up to the greater of the note or 80 of eligible accounts receivable based on the collateral assets at december 31 2017 7 million  was available to borrow at december 31 2017  there were no  outstanding borrowings 

the following table summarizes information regarding the company’s aggregate credit facility commitments letter of credit sublimits and available funds under those revolving credit facilities as well as outstanding amounts of commercial paper and outstanding borrowings under the respective facilities as of december 31 2017  and 2016  



the weightedaverage interest rate on awcc shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2017  and 2016  was approximately 124  and 078  respectively 

capital structure 

the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31 



the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in the current portion of longterm debt 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance with these covenants an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue new debt or access our revolving credit facility our longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things prohibit or restrict the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations 

covenants in certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization as defined in the relevant documents of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2017  our ratio was 059  to 100 and therefore we were in compliance with the covenants 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets may be directly affected by our securities ratings we primarily access the debt capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we have also issued debt through our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds to lower our overall cost of debt 

the following table presents our longterm and shortterm credit rating and rating outlook as of february 20 2018  



on january 19 2018 moody’s investors service changed the rating outlooks to negative from stable for 24 regulated utilities and utility holding companies including the company all of which were primarily impacted by enactment of the tcja a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that we provide collateral to secure our obligations we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends 

our board of directors authorizes the payment of dividends our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to having access to sufficient sources of liquidity the net income and cash flows of our subsidiaries the receipt of dividends and repayments of indebtedness from our subsidiaries compliance with delaware corporate and other laws compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements and other factors the company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration among other factors current and possible future developments that may affect the company’s income and cash flows historically dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record less than 30 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock are not cumulative only declared dividends are paid 

during 2017  2016  and 2015  we paid 289 million  261 million  and 239 million  in cash dividends respectively the following table summarizes the per share cash dividends paid for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



on december 8 2017  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 0415  per share payable on march 1 2018  to stockholders of record as of february 7 2018  

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us furthermore the ability of our subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to american water is subject to compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and other agreements or covenants made or entered into by american water and its subsidiaries 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims additionally annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going forward basis we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business information related to our contractual obligations as of december 31 2017  is summarized in the table below 



  

note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our marketbased businesses  are not included in the above amounts also uncertain tax positions of 106 million  are not reflected in this table as we cannot predict when open tax years will close with completed examinations see note 13—income taxes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 



publicprivate partnerships 

wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs these payments are considered “pilot payments” which represent payments that wvawc otherwise would pay as property taxes on the properties we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities which is presented in property plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets was approximately 150 million  as of december 31 2017  

performance obligations 

we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2068 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenues of 36 billion  as of december 31 2017  the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2018 and 2038 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 711 million  as of december 31 2017  some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates assumptions and judgments that could significantly affect a company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows as reflected in our consolidated financial statements management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with our audit committee including the estimates assumptions and judgments used in their application additional discussion regarding these critical accounting policies and their application can be found in note 2—significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

rate regulation and regulatory accounting 

our regulated utilities are subject to economic regulation by pucs and as such we follow the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our consolidated financial statements use of this authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria i thirdparty regulation of rates ii costbased rates and iii a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service plus a return on net investment or rate base as of december 31 2017  we concluded that the operations of our utilities met the criteria 

application of this authoritative guidance has a further effect on our financial statements as it pertains to allowable costs used in the ratemaking process we make significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities such judgments include but are not limited to assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions pension and postretirement benefits depreciation rates and taxes due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenues these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an nonregulated entity to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates conversely the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers regulators may also impose certain fines or penalties 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we assess at the end of each reporting period whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction and the status of any pending or potential legislation that could impact the ability to recover costs through regulated rates if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our consolidated statements of operations and financial position could be materially affected in addition if we conclude in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of this authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

on december 22 2017  the tcja was signed into law which among other things enacted significant and complex changes to the internal revenue code of 1986 including a reduction in the maximum us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  as of january 1 2018 the tcja created significant excess deferred income taxes that the company and its regulatory jurisdictions believe should be refunded to customers as such we recorded these amounts as regulatory liabilities the pucs in our regulatory jurisdictions have opened formal proceedings related to the tcja and we have begun working with our regulators on options to provide the income tax savings to our customers and to address customer rate impacts and cash flow impacts for the company the outcome of these proceedings will likely take some time and could vary by regulatory jurisdiction 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our regulatory asset balance was 11 billion  and 13 billion  respectively and our regulatory liability balance was 17 billion  and 403 million  respectively see note 6—regulatory assets and liabilities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

goodwill 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  our goodwill balance was 14 billion  and 13 billion  respectively under gaap goodwill must be allocated at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below and evaluated for impairment minimally once a year we perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill as of november 30  of each year or more frequently if we determine that changes in circumstances or a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred adverse industry or economic trends lower projections of profitability or a sustained decline in our market capitalization among other things may be indicators of potential goodwill impairment issues requiring the testing of the carrying value for recoverability 

entities evaluating goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary in performing a qualitative assessment we assess and makes judgments among other things around macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance cost factors and entity specific events these factors require significant judgment and estimates and application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results if it is determined based upon qualitative factors that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value no further testing is required if an entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment but determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value a twostep quantitative fair value assessment is performed 

the first step of a quantitative assessment compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying value including goodwill on the measurement date if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then the second step of the quantitative assessment is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the second step of a quantitative assessment requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value for the reporting unit an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense application of goodwill impairment testing requires significant management judgment including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit we estimate fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples analysis significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include but are not limited to forecasts of future operating results discount and growth rates capital expenditures tax rates working capital weighted average cost of capital and projected terminal values changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different results 

at november 30  2017  we completed qualitative assessments for our regulated businesses military services group and contract operations group reporting units and determined that no qualitative factors were present that would indicate the estimated fair values of these reporting units were less than their respective carrying values as such we determined that the twostep quantitative fair value assessment was not necessary for these reporting units as of november 30  2017  

at november 30  2017  we completed step one of the twostep quantitative assessment for our homeowner services group and keystone reporting units and concluded there were no impairments to their respective goodwill carry values we used an income approach valuation technique which estimates discounted future cash flows from operations which relies on a single scenario reflecting the best estimate of projected cash flows the estimated fair value of the homeowner services group reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 156  the estimated fair value of the keystone reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 11  if further decline in the fair value were to occur the keystone reporting unit would be at risk of failing step one of the twostep quantitative assessment additional discussion regarding our goodwill can be found in note 7—goodwill and other intangible assets  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment and longterm investments other than land and longterm investments our longlived assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable such circumstances include but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of the longlived asset a change in the asset’s expected useful life or physical condition a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset or a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or is planned to be used when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the longlived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the asset and compare it to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the longlived asset is greater than its fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of a longlived asset and thus could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of our regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable the fair values of our longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets all of which are factors that we consider when assessing the potential impairment of these investments if such longterm investments are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the investment’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenue for our regulated utilities is recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and includes amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts which are based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill to the end of the accounting period increases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue in addition changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation unbilled revenue for our regulated utilities as of december 31 2017  and 2016  was 152 million  and 161 million  respectively 

revenues of the marketbased businesses  are recognized as services are rendered for certain construction contracts revenue is recognized over the contract term based on a calculated ratio that compares the costs incurred to date during the period to the total estimated costs for the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined unbilled revenue for our marketbased businesses  as of december 31 2017  and 2016  was 60 million  and 102 million  respectively 

accounting for income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 

in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not morelikelythannot that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits no benefit is recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we conclude it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

under gaap specifically accounting standards codification “asc” topic 740 income taxes the tax effects of changes in tax laws must be recognized in the period in which the law is enacted asc 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled thus at the date of enactment the company’s deferred taxes were remeasured based upon the new tax rate for our regulated entities the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may be subject to refund to customers for our unregulated operations the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a noncash remeasurement adjustment to earnings 

the staff of the sec has recognized the complexity of reflecting the impacts of changes in tax law more specifically the tcja and on december 22 2017 issued guidance in staff accounting bulletin 118 “sab 118” which clarifies accounting for income taxes under asc 740 if information is not yet available or complete and provides for up to a one year period in which to complete the required analyses and accounting sab 118 describes three scenarios or buckets associated with a company’s status of accounting for the tcja1 a company is complete with its accounting for certain effects of tax reform 2 a company is able to determine a reasonable estimate for certain effects of tax reform and records that estimate as a provisional amount or 3 a company is not able to determine a reasonable estimate and therefore continues to apply asc 740 based on the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to the tcja being enacted the significant assumptions considered and evaluated by the company relating to our accounting for the tcja include but are not limited to the 

 actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws our forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for our regulated businesses  as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2017  and 2016  are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 13—income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations see note 14—employee benefits  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the description of and accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

 the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices we use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds the yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 375  428  and 466  at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 373  426  and 467  at december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

in selecting an eroa we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 649  for 2017  702  for 2016  and 691  for 2015  the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 509  for 2017  537  for 2016  and 492  for 2015  

the asset allocations for the company’s us pension plan by asset category were as follows 



during 2017 the company reduced the risk of its investments in the pension plan by reducing its exposure to equities from 60 to 50 and increasing its long duration fixedincome allocation from 40 to 50 this new structure is designed to reduce the plan’s funded status volatility it is also intended to reduce the pension plan’s exposure to interest rates since a higher proportion of long duration fixedincome securities that have a duration similar to that of the pension liabilities should reduce interest rate risk associated with the plan’s liabilities 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocations for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans by asset category were as follows 



  

the company’s target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class returns and risks correlations and the company’s risk tolerance in 2017 the company conducted new assetliability studies for the postretirement plans and approved new asset allocations for both plans the postretirement medical bargaining plan increased its equity allocation from 20 to 30 due to rising medical claims and medical inflation and the long duration portion of the portfolio was reduced from 80 to 70 the postretirement nonbargaining medical plan’s allocation was adjusted to reduce volatility and interest rate risk in a manner similar to that described above with respect to the pension plan reducing the equity allocation from 70 to 60 and increasing the fixedincome allocation from 30 to 40 the postretirement medical nonbargaining plan’s equity allocation was reduced due to the cap on benefits for some nonunion participants and the resultant reduction in the plan’s liabilities these changes will be implemented in 2018 

the investments of the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 41  of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 59  of the assets are valued using other inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 302  for 2017  307  for 2016  and 310  for 2015  

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs as of january 1 2017 our health care cost trend rate assumption used to calculate the periodic cost was 7  in 2017  gradually declining to 5  in 2021  and thereafter as of december 31 2017 the company is projecting that medical inflation will continue to persist for longer than expected and it will ultimately trend down to 450 but not until 2026 

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 



  

we will use a discount rate and eroa of 375  and 595  respectively for estimating our 2018  pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 373  and 477  respectively for estimating our 2018  other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2017  and 2016  pension and postretirement benefit costs were 56 million  and 54 million  respectively the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts up to 45 million  in 2018  and 47 million  47 million  51 million  and 58 million  in 2019  2020  2021  and 2022  respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

accounting for contingencies 

we record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated the determination of a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter which may include an analysis of different scenarios liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible management considers many factors which include but are not limed to the nature of the litigation claim or assessment review of applicable law opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors and the experience gained from similar cases or situations we provide disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred we provide estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined either as a single amount or within a reasonable range 

actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies see note 15—commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2017  a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1  associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in an 8 million  increase in shortterm interest expense 

the company has two forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 200 million to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2018 the forward starting swap agreements terminate in november 2018 and have an average fixed rate of 259  when entering into forward starting interest rate swaps the company is subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate that impacts the fair value of the forward starting interest rate swaps we manage market risk by matching terms of the swaps with the critical terms of the expected debt issuance the fair value of the forward starting swaps at december 31 2017 was in a loss position of 3 million  a hypothetical 1  adverse change in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our forward starting swaps of approximately 32 million  at december 31 2017  

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated services provided by our regulated businesses  and marketbased businesses  our regulated businesses  serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while our marketbased businesses  engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses  are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset values can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements changes in interest rates can impact retirement liabilities we aim to reduce risk through asset diversification and by investing in long duration fixedincome securities that have a duration similar to that of our pension liabilities seeking to hedge some of the interest rate sensitivity of our liabilities that way if interest rates fall and liabilities increase we expect that the fixedincome assets in our retirement trust will also increase in value we also expect our risk to be reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates 

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses  may be adversely impacted

tableend changes to longterm equity award retirement provisions 

on february 14 2018 our board of directors and executive development and compensation committee approved changes to the retirement provisions of equity awards granted under the company’s 2017 omnibus equity compensation plan the “omnibus plan” to persons serving as the company’s chief executive officer chief financial officer or chief operating officer each a “covered executive” so long as the covered executive has held one or more of those titles or any other title that contains such title for a period of at least three years of consecutive service 

these changes acknowledge that these three positions consistently make andor should make decisions that are in both the shortterm and longterm interests of the company and extend the vesting of equity awards beyond the covered executive’s retirement date to reflect the desired accountability the changes apply to awards that are granted or may be granted to a covered executive under the omnibus plan commencing on february 14 2018 these changes did not affect any equity award granted under the omnibus plan prior to february 14 2018 

except as contemplated by the amended retirement provisions the company will not permit the acceleration of vesting of any longterm equity award granted under the omnibus plan on account of retirement of a covered executive with respect to a covered executive the amended retirement provisions for a longterm equity award state that such award will continue to vest over the normal vesting schedule of the award after the covered executive has a separation from service based upon either normal retirement or early retirement in the event of a normal retirement of a covered executive defined as having attained age 60 and five years of service with the company or any subsidiary an award will vest in full over the normal vesting schedule of the award in the event of an early retirement of a covered executive defined as having attained age 55 and five years of service with the company or any subsidiary 75 of each award will vest over the normal vesting schedule of the award performance stock unit awards will continue to vest in accordance with their normal vesting schedule and shall be paid at the end of the threeyear performance period based on actual performance any stock option granted after february 14 2018 to a covered executive will remain exercisable for a period of two years after the retirement date

with a history dating back to 1886 american water works company inc is a holding company originally incorporated in delaware in 1936 through its subsidiaries american water is the largest and most geographically diverse investorowned publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the united states as measured by both operating revenues and population served we also operate several marketbased businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services we employ approximately 6800 professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to an estimated 15 million people in 47 states the district of columbia and ontario canada

throughout this annual report on form 10k unless the context otherwise requires references to “we” “us” “our” the “company” and “american water” mean american water works company inc and its subsidiaries taken together as a whole

operating segments

the largest component of the company’s business includes rate regulated subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater services to customers in 16 states collectively presented as our “regulated businesses” we conduct the majority of our business through the regulated businesses segment we also operate marketbased businesses within four operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” these four nonreportable operating segments are collectively presented as our “marketbased businesses” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses additional information can be found in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 19—segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulated businesses 

our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial and other customers including sale for resale and public authority customers our regulated businesses that provide these services operate in approximately 1600 communities in 16 states in the united states and are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation referred to as public utility commissions “pucs” certain federal and state governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters we report the results of the services provided by our utilities in our regulated businesses segment

our regulated businesses segment’s operating revenues were 2871 million for 2016 2743 million for 2015 and 2674 million for 2014 accounting for 869 868 and 888 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

the following table summarizes our regulated businesses’ operating revenues number of customers and estimated population served by state each as of and for the year ended december 31 2016 

 



 



 

water supply and wastewater services 

our regulated businesses generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to our customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law we are dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from ground water sources such as wells and aquifers and water purchased from third party water suppliers the level of treatment we apply to the water varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment while groundwater sources require chemical treatment only 

the following chart depicts the sources of water supply as of december 31 2016 

 

the percentages of water supply by source type for our top seven states based on our regulated businesses operating revenues for 2016 were as follows 

 



 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate water supply drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water we employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas may mitigate some of the economic effect on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service territory for example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas we serve may experience wetter than average weather 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate water supply we use longterm planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development an example of our use of longterm planning to ensure that we have adequate water supply is our involvement in the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” in california the water supply project includes the construction of a desalination plant owned by californiaamerican water company our wholly owned subsidiary “cal am” which includes the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant in 

 

addition the water supply project also includes cal am’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” between the monterey regional water pollution control agency “mrwpca” and the monterey peninsula water management district “mpwmd” the water supply project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of cal am to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under orders of the california state water resources control board the “swrcb”  

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations

economic regulation and rate making process 

our regulated businesses operate under a regulatory compact whereby in exchange for exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services in defined service territories we have an obligation to serve customers within those territories requesting service within reasonable limits in return for agreeing to invest capital into our water and wastewater systems we are given the opportunity to recover our costs of doing business and earn a reasonable rate of return on our investments

the operations of our regulated businesses are generally subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state pucs with the primary responsibility of the pucs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital capital expenditures om expenses taxes transactions and affiliate relationships reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

the process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the puc on a periodic basis the timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions 

our rate case management program is guided by the principles of obtaining timely recovery of capital investment costs recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption and appropriate recovery of utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the program attempts to minimize the delay or “regulatory lag” between the time our regulated businesses make a capital investment or incur an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates the management team at each of our utilities accounts for the time required for the regulatory process and files rate cases with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective 

 

our regulated businesses support regulatory pr actices at the pucs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag examples of approved regulatory practices include 

 



 

we pursue or seek enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments in order to provide safe reliable and affordable services to our customers the ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept our proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

we also support state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries legislation in certain states has generally enabled sales between interested parties has allowed a reasonable market valuation of purchased property and has enabled consolidation of water and wastewater rates

customers 

our regulated businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base a customer is a person corporation municipality or any other entity that purchases our water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period also a single customer may purchase our services for use by multiple individuals or businesses in the case of many homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities 

residential customers make up the majority of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate in 2016 residential customers accounted for 911 of our customer base 590 of the billed water sales and 555 of the operating revenues of our regulated businesses we also serve commercial customers such as offices retail stores and restaurants industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we also supply water through our distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities as well as to other water utilities in the form of bulk water supplies for distribution to their own customers

the vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water usage typically on a monthly basis we employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption these methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices touch read or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based on their water consumption 

 

the following table summarizes the number of water and wastewater customers we served by class as of december 31 

 



 

customer growth in our regulated businesses is primarily driven by the following factors







generally we add customers through acquisitions of small and medium water andor wastewater systems in close geographic proximity to areas where we operate our regulated businesses which we refer to as “tuckins” the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using our existing management and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs pursuing tuckins has been and continues to be a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate pursue acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to our customers as well as a line of sight to grow our base customers after entering the new market for more information see item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—2016 strategic focus  achievements—growth

seasonality

customer demand for our water service is affected by weather and is generally greater during the summer months primarily due to increased usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use as such we typically expect our operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year compared to any of the other quarters however varying summer weather conditions can impact our third quarter financial results summer weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues and operating income summer weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues and operating income

competition

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct competition in our existing markets because i we operate in those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a high barrier to market entry however our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors when pursuing acquisitions based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environnement company sa american states water company and california water service group from time to time we also face competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as algonquin power and utilities corp and corix

all or portions of our regulated subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by state municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods 







 

the acquisition consideration related to such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter 

we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as developments occur we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses either individually or taken as a whole 

marketbased businesses 

through our marketbased businesses we provide services to military bases municipalities oil and gas exploration and production companies and to some commercial industrial and residential customers these customers are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs and do not require significant capital investment 

our marketbased businesses segment’s operating revenues were 451 million for 2016 434 million for 2015 and 355 million for 2014 accounting for 137 137 and 118 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods included within the marketbased businesses segment results is operating revenues attributed to canadian operations of 6 million 6 million and 7 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

our marketbased businesses are comprised of four operating segments 









military services group

our military services group operates on 12 military bases under 50year contracts with the us department of defense “dod” the scope of the contracts includes om of the water and wastewater systems on the bases and a capital program the replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the company is funded from the contract fee at times new assets are required to support the base’s mission construction of new assets are funded by the us dod as additional work under the contract the capital program does not use the company’s equity or debt borrowings however some working capital is used to fund workinprocess until paid by the us dod the contract price for nine of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions three of these contracts are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called “economic price adjustment” during the contract term we may make limited shortterm working capital investments under our contracts with the us dod all of these contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to these contracts we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs

homeowner services group

our homeowner services group through our various protection programs provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against the cost of interior and external water and sewer line repairs interior electric line repairs and other services our linesaver™ program involves partnering with utilities municipalities and other organizations to offer our protection programs to customers serviced by or affiliated with those municipalities and organizations terms of these partnership agreements are typically three to five years in length with optional renewals as of december 31 2016 our homeowner services group had approximately 17 million customer contracts in 43 states and the district of columbia and 10 linesaver™ partnership agreements with municipalities and other organizations 

 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including i om ii design build and operate and iii design build finance operate and maintain contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities the food and beverage industry and other customers historically we have made minimal longterm capital investment under these contracts instead we perform our services for a fee occasionally we provide our customers with financing for capital projects as part of a longterm om partnership as of december 31 2016 our contract operations group had 43 contracts across the united states and canada varying in size and scope and ranging in length from one to 30 years 

keystone

in july 2015 we acquired a ninetyfive percent interest in water solutions holdings llc including its wholly owned subsidiary keystone clearwater solutions llc collectively referred to as “keystone” keystone is a water management solution company currently focused on exploration and production customers in the appalachian basin as well as customers in the municipal water services market keystone primarily provides customized water sourcing transfer storage and transport services along with pipeline construction services for natural gas exploration and production companies keystone operates under master service agreements that generally range from two to five years when the initial term of these agreements expire they typically renew automatically on an annual basis and generally are cancelable by either party with 30 days prior notice as of december 31 2016 keystone serves 58 customers 

competition

we face competition in our marketbased businesses from a number of service providers including veolia environnement sa american states water company operations management international inc and southwest water company particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competitive as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as the municipal and industrial fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process our homeowner services group faces competition primarily from homeserve usa pivotal home solutions owned by southern company gas and dominion energy solutions keystone currently faces competition from water service providers that typically provide particular segments of the water management cycle such as rockwater energy solutions rain for rent and fluid delivery solutions llc

industry and regulatory matters

overview 

the united states water and wastewater industries include investorowned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions both industries are highly fragmented the us environmental protection agency the “epa” estimates that approximately 84 of the united states water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98 of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned according to the epa there are approximately 50000 community water systems and approximately 20000 community wastewater systems in the united states over half of the community water systems are very small serving a population of 500 or less 

this large number of relatively small fragmented water systems and wastewater systems may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time 

 

the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in need of modernization and replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of water and wastewater residuals’ discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization in 2011 the epa estimated that the nation’s drinking water utilities needed 3 842 billion in infrastructure investments between 2011 and 2030 for thousands of miles of pipe treatment plants storage tanks and other key assets to ensure the public health security and economic wellbeing of our cities towns and communities in t he clean watersheds needs survey 2012 report to congress the epa also estimated that 2710 billion of capital investments and would be necessary between 2012 and 2032 to meet the nation’s wastewater and stormwater treatment and collection needs additio nally in 2013 the american society of civil engineers “asce” published its report card for america’s infrastructure in which it gave the water and wastewater infrastructure a grade of “d” because much of the infrastructure is nearing the end of its us eful life the asce report concluded that there will be an investment gap between 2013 and 2020 of 84 billion for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both our regulated businesses and marketbased businesses are subject to extensive us federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge recycle and dispose of wastewater these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other us federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we also are subject to various us federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently the overall trend has been that they have become increasingly stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could increase we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our operations are subject in the past our regulated businesses have generally been able to recover costs associated with compliance related to environmental health and safety standards however this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery we estimate that we will make capital expenditures of 83 million during 2017 and 78 million during 2018 for environmental control facilities which we define for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land

 

we maintain an environmental program including responsi ble business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural resources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples from across our water systems are analyzed on a regular basis for compliance with regulatory requirements across our company we conduct over one million water quality tests each yea r at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2016 we achieved a score of greater than 99 for drinking water compliance and according to the epa’s statistics american water’s performance has been far better than the industry average over the last several years in fact in 2016 american water systems were 21 times b etter than the industry average for compliance with drinking water requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water the epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 69 of our 81 surface water plants receiving the program’s “director” award which recognizes utilities that 1 have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report 2 created an action plan for continuous improvement and 3 produced high quality drinking water we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 66 american water surface water plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award while 60 plants have been awarded the “tenyear phase iii” award additionally 39 surface water plants received the “fifteenyear phase iii” award which recognizes plants that have met the director award status for 15 years further nine surface water plants have been awarded the “presidents” award which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards

safe drinking water act 

 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns to date the epa has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water

the epa administrator has the authority to require monitoring for additional unregulated contaminants to help formulate the basis for future regulations many of our systems recently completed the process for monitoring 28 unregulated contaminants under the third round of the unregulated contaminant monitoring rule and our laboratory and systems are preparing for the fourth round of testing expected to begin in 2018 there are thousands of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology the process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complicated but american water actively participates with the epa and other water industry groups by sharing its research and water quality operational knowledge 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources in july 2014 the state of california implemented a primary drinking water standard of 10 micrograms per liter for hexavalent chromium in 2016 the revised total coliform rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceedance of bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects we are in compliance with these standards the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds we do not anticipate that any such regulations if enacted will require implementation in 2017 

the epa revised the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule in 2007 and congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act in january 2011 regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings or fixtures solder and flux however the events in flint michigan have highlighted attention on the occurrence of lead – primarily in building plumbing – and it is anticipated that the epa will propose updated regulations in 2017 american water’s inventory of lead service lines is expected to be completed by the end of 2017 it is currently estimated that approximately 5 of our service lines contain lead our goal is to replace our lead service lines over approximately 10 years at an estimated cost of 600 million to 12 billion in cases where we are replacing an american water owned lead service line our standard approach will be to replace the companyowned portion and work with the customer to replace the customerowned portion of the service line all the way to the customer’s home replacing the full service line is considered a best practice as advised by the lead service line replacement collaborative a collaborative of leading water industry organizations we do not plan on replacing customerowned lead service lines at locations where our portion of the service line does not contain lead or is not part of a main replacement project

 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act and other s imilar laws to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by the state pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act which must be renewed every five years pursuant to the npdes permit program the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems discharges that exceed the limits specified under npdes permits can lead to the imposition of penalties and persistent noncompliance could lead to significant penalties and compliance costs in addition the difficulty of obtaining and complying with npdes permits and renewing expiring permits may impose time and cost burdens on our operations from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals which generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” authorizes the epa and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as the owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under cercla or comparable state laws although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the us occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see item 1—business—research and development

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters further description of these proceedings can be found in item 3—legal proceedings

research and development 

we have a research and development program which seeks to improve water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our business our research and development personnel are located in new jersey and illinois in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports our research and development activities through testing and analysis 

we continue to collaborate with the epa to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship includes sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa provides us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

approximately onequarter of our research budget is funded by competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers in 2016 we spent 4 million including 1 million funded by research grants spending net of research grant funding amounted to 3 million in 2015 and 2014 

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical for providing safe reliable and affordable services as well as maintaining our leadership position in the industry which provides us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

 

support services 

american water works service company inc “service company” is our wholly owned subsidiary that provides support and operational services for our operating subsidiaries these services are provided predominantly to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these subsidiaries that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services are also provided to our marketbased businesses organized under american water enterprises they are only provided to keystone upon its request these services which are provided at cost may include accounting and finance administration business development communications compliance education and training engineering health and safety human resources information systems internal audit investor relations legal and governance operations procurement rates support security risk management treasury water quality and research and development service company also operates two national customer service centers located in alton illinois and pensacola florida which provide customer relations operations and field service support to the regulated businesses the services are provided at cost and enable our regulated businesses and marketbased businesses to fulfill their responsibilities in a more costeffective manner

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business operations

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation by state pucs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our utility operations also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these regulatory requirements

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to economic regulation by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to







approval of the pucs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations state pucs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations our utilities are also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the pucs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business

in any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the level estimated in establishing rates

 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental water quality and health and safety la ws and regulations compliance with increasingly stringent laws and regulations could impact our operating costs and violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs as well as damage to our reputation 

our water and wastewater operations and the operations of our marketbased businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include cercla the clean water act and the safe drinking water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations for example cercla authorizes the epa to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations 

in addition state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future

attention is being given to emerging contaminants including without limitation chemicals and other substances that currently do not have any regulatory standard in drinking water or have been recently created or discovered including by means of scientific achievements in the analysis and detection of trace amounts of substances examples of sources of emerging contaminants include but are not limited to newly created chemical compounds including for example perfluorinated compounds and manufactured nanomaterials human and veterinary products microbes viruses amoebae and other pathogens and residual byproducts of disinfection we rely upon governmental agencies to set appropriate regulatory standards to protect the public from these and other contaminants our role is to meet or surpass those standards when established in some of our states pucs may disapprove of cost recovery in whole or in part for implementation of treatment infrastructure for an emerging contaminant in the absence of a regulatory standard furthermore while we seek to protect our drinking water from these contaminants by implementing multistep treatment processes reviewing research on these contaminants and developing appropriate mitigation techniques for new contaminants where feasible or appropriate given the rapid pace at which emerging contaminants are being created andor discovered we may not be able to detect andor mitigate all such substances in our drinking water system which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition results of operations and reputation in addition we believe emerging contaminants may form the basis for additional or increased federal or state regulatory initiatives and requirements in the future which could significantly increase the cost of our operations

 

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrict ions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water

for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 20 2009 cease and desist order the “2009 order” as amended by an order in july 2016 the “2016 order” of the swrcb that requires cal am to significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule which was extended to december 31 2021 the “2021 deadline” we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act we cannot predict whether cal am will be able to secure alternative sources of water or if cal am will be exposed to liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2021 deadline under the 2009 order and the 2016 order if cal am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected see item 3—legal proceedings in this report which includes additional information regarding this matter

the current regulatory rate setting process may result in a significant delay also known as “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can seek to address these events in rate case applications our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business

there is typically a delay known as “regulatory lag” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

we endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory policies for example eight state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates furthermore in setting rates a number of state pucs allow us to use future test years which extend beyond the date a rate request is filed to allow for current or projected revenues expenses and investments to be reflected in rates on a more timely basis other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the rate case application process while these programs have reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states we continue to seek expansion of programs to reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved such programs furthermore pucs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form or at all although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected

 

changes in laws and regulations and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liq uidity 

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others



























any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

furthermore the results of the november 2016 federal state and local elections have generated some uncertainty as to certain future new or changes in existing laws rules or regulations or administrative interpretations thereof at this time we are unable to determine or predict the potential impacts if any of such new or amended laws rules or regulations or interpretations thereof to the extent they may be ultimately enacted adopted or issued on us or our businesses financial condition and results of operations

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters may disrupt our operations and economic conditions may reduce the demand for water services either of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

service interruptions due to severe weather and other natural events are possible across all our businesses these include storms freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornadoes earthquakes landslides coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains severe electrical storms and solar flares weather and other natural events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage in addition adverse economic conditions can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows seasonal drought conditions that may impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas g overnmental restrictions imposed in response to a droug ht may apply to all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system as examples drought conditions have persisted in california over a fiveyear period and more recently have been declared in new jersey in may 2016  the governor of california issued an executive order that retained existing water use restrictions but required state agencies to adjust among other things water conservation regulations through the end of january 2017 to account for differentiation i n water supply conditions throughout the state to adopt new water use targets as part of a permanent framework for urban water usage and conservation to prohibit permanently practices that waste potable water and to direct actions that minimize significa nt water system leaks moreover in october 2016 a drought warning was declared in 14 northern and central new jersey counties by the new jersey department of environmental protection and while mandatory use restrictions have not presently been adopted residents business and other institutions in the affected areas have been urged to use water sparingly while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans may generally be recoverable provided the relevant puc determines they w ere reasonable and prudent we cannot assure that any such expenses incurred will in fact be fully recovered moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist ev en after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future changing severe weather patterns could require additional expenditures to reduce the risk associated with any increasing storm flood and drought occurrences the issue of climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide many climate change predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities such as increased frequency and duration of droughts increased precipitation and flooding potential degradation of water quality and changes in demand for services because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate change we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2016 we invested 13 billion in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems could increase in the future we expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt we may not be able to access the debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all

in addition we could be limited in our ability to both pursue growth and pay dividends in accordance with our dividend policy in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we expect that we will need additional financing 

the ability to obtain financing at reasonable rates is contingent upon our credit ratings and general market conditions if we do not obtain sufficient financing we could be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our water service and our revenues

demand for our water during the warmer months typically in the summer is generally greater than during other months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months demand tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues

 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover if we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow or disposal operations our losses might not be covered by insurance and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

contamination of our sources of water or water service provided to our customers could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject us and our subsidiaries to reduction in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions damage to our reputation and private litigation

the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants or are delivered through our distribution system or the water service that is provided to our customers are subject to contamination including by among other items contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate methyl tertiary butyl ether lead and other materials chemical spills or other accidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks in addition new categories of these substances continue to emerge in the water treatment industry if one of our water supplies or the water service provided to our customers is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 continuing limited use of the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply if service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods we may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through insurance customer rates tariffs or contract terms any recovery of these costs that we are able to obtain through regulatory proceedings or otherwise may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of an interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water and water supplies 

in this regard on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances into the elk river near the west virginiaamerican water company “wvawc” treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia on october 31 2016 the us district court for the southern district of west virginia approved the preliminary principles terms and conditions of a binding global agreement in principle to settle claims arising out the freedom industries chemical spill the “settlement” under the terms of the settlement wvawc has agreed that it will not seek rate recovery from the public service commission of west virginia for the amounts paid by wvawc net of insurance recoveries under the settlement see item 3—legal proceedings which includes additional information regarding this matter

since we engage in the business of providing water service to our customers contamination of the water supply or the water service provided to our customers can result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur negative impacts to our reputation may occur even if we are not liable for any contamination or other environmental damage or the consequences arising out of human exposure to contamination or hazardous substances in the water or water supplies in addition insurance coverage may not cover all or a portion of these losses and are subject to deductibles and other limitations pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured

we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations as well as the operations of our marketbased businesses our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make generally our insurance policies cover property damage worker’s compensation employer’s liability general liability terrorism risks and automobile liability each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims as a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured

 

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the futur e or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles 

we are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions 

water and wastewater utilities including our regulated subsidiaries have a large customer base and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of their water and wastewater services the quality of water provided and the amount timeliness accuracy and format of bills that are provided for such services adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies state pucs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view companies such american water and its regulated subsidiaries in a favorable light and may cause american water and its regulated subsidiaries to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent regulatory requirements unfavorable regulatory outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on american water and each of our regulated subsidiaries’ business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

the properties of our regulated businesses segment include 80 dams a failure of any of which could result in personal injury and downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs although in most cases the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future the inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems any further acquisitions we undertake may involve risks further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and strategic and financial buyers may hinder our ability to grow our business

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we may not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and strategic and financial buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 

 

the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in among other things 





















some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to finance our business pay dividends and to comply with regulatory requirements the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions in addition our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities adjacent to or near our existing service areas thereby impairing our ability to geographically expand the affected service areas competing governmental entities utilities environmental or social activist groups and strategic and financial buyers have challenged and may in the future challenge our efforts to acquire new companies andor service areas our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new companies andor service areas with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations any of these risks may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain or other similar authorized process

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process should a municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition we may resist the acquisition

contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain or other process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of management of the affected regulated business from the operation of its business moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation or process may not be successful

if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges

 

we rely on technology systems to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our technology systems particularly our operational technology and it systems are an integral part of our business and any disruption of these systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations for example we depend on these systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage certain plant operations and construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections these systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers while we continue to implement upgrade and replace our operational technology and it systems a number of our mission and businesscritical it systems are older such as our scada supervisory control and data acquisition system

although we do not believe that these systems are at a materially greater risk of failure or cybersecurity incidents than other similar organizations our operational technology and it systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from













these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and other adverse consequences in addition a lack of or inadequate levels of redundancy for certain of these systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency

we may be subject to physical andor cyber attacks

as operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical andor cyber attacks our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes our operational technology and it systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties while we have instituted certain safeguards to protect our operational technology and it systems those safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyber attacks and cyber vulnerabilities we cannot guarantee that such protections will be completely successful in the event of a cyber attack

if despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred we could have our operations disrupted property damaged and customer and other confidential information stolen experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss and be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows these types of events either impacting our facilities or the industry in general could also cause us to incur additional security and insurance related costs

in addition in the ordinary course of business we collect and retain sensitive information including personally identifiable information about our customers and employees in many cases we outsource administration of certain functions to vendors that could be targets of cyber attacks any theft loss andor fraudulent use of customer employee or proprietary data as a result of a cyber attack could subject us to significant litigation liability and costs as well as adversely impact our reputation with customers and regulators among others

our inability to efficiently upgrade and improve our operational technology and it systems or implement new systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability

upgrades and improvements to computer systems and networks or the implementation of new systems may require substantial amounts of management’s time and financial resources to complete and may also result in system or network defects or operational errors due to multiple factors including employees’ ability to effectively use the new or upgraded system over the past several years 

 

we have implemented and have recently implemented with respect to o ur american water enterprises business improvements to our business processes and have installed new and upgraded existing technology systems these efforts support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to optimize workflow improve our op erations and enhance our customer service capabilities any technical or other difficulties in upgrading and improving existing or implementing new technology systems may increase costs beyond those anticipated and have an adverse or disruptive effect on o ur operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting we may also experience difficulties consolidating our current systems and implementing new or upgraded systems together with existing systems which may impact our ability to serve our customers effectively or efficiently although we make efforts to minimize any adverse impact on our controls business and operations we cannot assure that all such impacts have been or will be mitigated and any such impacts cou ld harm our business individually or collectively and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our business has inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to not only people impacts but also to financial losses such as penalties and other liabilities

our safety record is critical to our reputation we maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers vendors and the public although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards and aim for zero injuries it is extremely difficult to avoid accidents at all times 

our business sites including construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment moving vehicles pressurized water underground trenches and vaults chemicals and other regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others our employees and others may be injured or die unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

in addition our operations can involve the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly handled stored or disposed of could subject us to penalties or other liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations or procedures could subject us to liability

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations

as of december 31 2016 approximately 46 of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 78 collective bargaining agreements in place with 17 different unions representing our unionized employees these collective bargaining agreements including three which expired in 2016 and 15 which will expire during 2017 are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation we may not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are fair to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers licensed operators water quality and other operating and craft personnel and management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 

financial and marketrelated risks 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs

as of december 31 2016 our aggregate longterm and shortterm debt balance including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 72 billion and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including















in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new shortterm and longterm debt securities moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2017 2018 and 2019 will be 574 million 457 million and 166 million respectively we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all moreover if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

in an attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our issuance of variable and fixedrate debt we have entered into and in the future may enter into financial derivative instruments including without limitation interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements see item 7a—quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk however these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties including quarterly “mark to market” valuation risk associated with these instruments that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we will depend primarily on cash flows from operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative including tax initiatives and reforms and other similar legislation or regulation regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected adversely

our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

in addition to cash from operations we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external sources of shortterm liquidity are our 16 billion commercial paper program and our 175 billion revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility expires in accordance with its terms in june 2020 we regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2016 american water capital corp “awcc” our wholly owned financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had 849 million of commercial paper outstanding and 88 million in outstanding letters of credit 

 

under the terms of our revolving credit facility our consolidated debt cannot exceed 70 of our consolidated capitalization as determined under the terms of the credit facility if our equity were to decline or debt were to increase to a level that caused our debt to exceed this limit lenders under the credit facility would be entitled to refuse any further extension of credit and to declare all of the outstanding debt under the credit facility immediately due and payable to avoid such a default a waiver or renegotiation of this covenant would be required which would likely increase funding costs and could result in additional covenants that would restrict our operational and financing flexibility 

our ability to comply with this and other covenants contained in the revolving credit facility and our other consolidated indebtedness is subject to various risks and uncertainties including events beyond our control for example events that could cause a reduction in equity include without limitation a significant writedown of our goodwill even if we are able to comply with this or other covenants the limitations on our operational and financial flexibility could harm our business by among other things limiting our ability to incur indebtedness or reduce equity in connection with financings or other corporate opportunities that we may believe would be in our best interests or the interests of our stockholders to complete

disruptions in the capital markets could also limit our ability to access capital while our credit facility lending banks have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments our lenders may not meet their existing commitments and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital and credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures

any impediments to our access to the capital markets or failure of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

american water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to american water

american water is a holding company and as such american water has no operations of its own substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries american water’s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends to american water or repay indebtedness to american water prior to paying dividends to american water american water’s regulated subsidiaries must comply with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and covenants and other agreements made or entered into by american water and its subsidiaries american water’s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to pay dividends to american water a failure or inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on american water’s liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards

as of december 31 2016 we had us federal and state net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 12 billion and 625 million respectively and management believes these nols are more likely than not to be recovered in the future our federal nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and our state nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 and will continue to expire through 2036 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our nols and the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of the nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include 13 billion of goodwill at december 31 2016 the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 and the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and to a lesser extent the acquisition of keystone in 2015 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business these market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or with respect to keystone fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the marcellus and utica shale regions served by keystone a prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our current or future forecasts of operating results cash flows or key assumptions a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization the effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators

market conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows

new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the sec the financial accounting standards board or other authoritative bodies or governmental entities may issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards that may require us to change our accounting policies these changes are beyond our control can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our results of operations cash flow and financial condition we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which could adversely affect our results of operations cash flow and financial condition

 

undetected errors in internal controls and information reporting could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure 

our internal controls accounting policies and practices and internal information systems are designed to enable us to capture and process transactions and information in a timely and accurate manner in compliance with gaap taxation requirements federal securities laws and regulations and other laws and regulations applicable to us such compliance permits us to among other things disclose and report financial and other information in connection with the recovery of our costs and with the reporting requirements under federal securities tax and other laws and regulations 

we have implemented corporate governance internal control and accounting policies and procedures in connection with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the “sarbanesoxley act” and relevant sec rules as well as other applicable regulations such internal controls and policies have been and continue to be closely monitored by our management and board of directors to ensure continued compliance with these laws rules and regulations management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls while we believe these controls policies practices and systems are adequate to verify data integrity unanticipated and unauthorized actions of employees or temporary lapses in internal controls due to shortfalls in oversight or resource constraints could lead to undetected errors that could result in the disallowance of cost recovery and noncompliant disclosure and reporting the consequences of these events could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition the inability of management to certify as to the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls could also increase financing costs or could also adversely affect our or awcc’s ability to access the capital markets 

additional risks related to our marketbased businesses

we excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our marketbased businesses including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients which may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased businesses do not satisfy these obligations

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased businesses including financial guarantees or deposits in the event our marketbased businesses fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected

at december 31 2016 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 39 billion and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased businesses expand the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms

american water enterprises’ operations are subject to various risks associated with doing business with the us government

we enter into contracts with the us department of defense for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems which contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

moreover entering into contracts with the us government subjects us to a number of operational and compliance risks including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement and security regulations we are subject to potential government investigations of our business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations which are complex and compliance with these regulations can be expensive and burdensome if we were charged with wrongdoing as a result of an investigation we could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new contracts with the us government which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows

 

american water enterprises operates a number of water and wastewater systems under o m contracts and faces the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems which may negatively affect american water enterprises as the operators of the systems 

american water enterprises operates a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts american water enterprises operates the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements in some cases american water enterprises may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on american water enterprises as the operator of the system and us and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to us to the same extent as if we were the owner 

our marketbased businesses are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received

some of our marketbased businesses enter into longterm contracts under which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee these marketbased businesses are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

keystone’s operations may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters

keystone’s operations and the operation generally of natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities by keystone’s customers are subject to stringent federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection these provisions may require the acquisition by keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers prohibit the release of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may result from these operations failure to comply with these laws rules regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs to keystone the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities under existing environmental laws and regulations keystone could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed while we have structured and maintained our ownership and control of keystone’s operations in such a way that we believe will insulate the company its regulated subsidiaries and its other marketbased businesses from any liabilities associated with keystone’s operations including liabilities for environmental matters there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the company from incurring liability for the operations of keystone

changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes to these or other laws governing the natural gas and oil exploration industry that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could require keystone to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance with such requirements may harm keystone’s business and results of operations by reducing the demand for keystone’s water and related services and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on keystone’s competitive position financial condition results of operations and cash flows

alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

under the 2009 order cal am is required among other things to decrease significantly its yearly diversions of water from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule the 2009 order responded to claims that cal am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions of water from the carmel river as required by a 1995 swrcb order on july 19 2016 at the request of cal am and several monterey county government agencies the swrcb issued an order the “2016 order” approving a fiveyear extension of the deadline to comply with the 2009 order to december 31 2021 on november 29 2016 the water ratepayers association of the monterey peninsula a citizens’ advocacy group filed an action in sacramento county superior court against the swrcb and its board members and naming cal am as the real party in interest seeking to reverse the extension of the 2009 order to rescind the designation by the california public utilities commission the “cpuc” of cal am as the public utility water provider to the monterey peninsula and to appoint a receiver to oversee cal am’s compliance with the 2009 order with ultimate transfer to a public entity this lawsuit is pending

regional desalination project litigation

the regional desalination project the “rdp” involved the construction of a desalination facility in the city of marina north of monterey the rdp was intended to among other things eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under the 2009 order in december 2010 the cpuc approved the rdp which was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the mcwra and cal am in 2011 due to a conflict of interest concerning a former member of the mcwra’s board of directors mcwra stated that the agreements were void and as a result cal am terminated the agreements in april 2015 the cpuc approved a settlement agreement among cal am mcwra and the county of monterey to resolve these matters among the parties signing the agreement on march 23 2016 the supreme court of california granted mcwd’s petition for review of the cpuc approval action on the petition has been deferred pending consideration and disposition of a related issue in another case

in october 2012 cal am filed a complaint for declaratory relief against mcwra and mcwd which was ultimately transferred to the san francisco county superior court seeking a determination as to whether the agreements are void as a result of the alleged conflict of interest in june 2015 the court entered a final judgment agreeing with cal am’s position that four of the five agreements are void and one the credit line agreement is not void on november 10 2016 the supreme court of california denied mcwd’s final appeal of this judgment which allows further proceedings to determine the amount of damages that may be awarded in the proceeding

in july 2015 cal am and mcwra filed a complaint in san francisco county superior court against mcwd and rmc water and environment a private engineering consulting firm “rmc” seeking to recover compensatory damages in excess of 10 million associated with the failure of the rdp as well as punitive and treble damages statutory penalties and attorneys’ fees shortly thereafter complaints seeking similar damages were filed in the same court by mcwd and rmc against cal am and mcwra in excess of 19 million in the aggregate in december 2015 the court consolidated all of these complaints into a single action which remains pending

 

monterey peninsula water supply project 

the water supply project is intended to reduce water diversions from the carmel river and involves construction of a desalination plant owned by cal am and purchase of water by cal am from the gwr project cal am’s ability to move forward on the water supply project is subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc and other government agencies obtaining necessary permits and intervention from other parties on march 17 2016 the cpuc’s energy division issued a notice of further schedule delays for the water supply project’s environmental review with environmental certification currently scheduled for completion in november 2017 on january 12 2017 the cpuc issued a draft environmental impact reportenvironmental impact statement

on september 15 2016 the cpuc unanimously approved a decision to authorize cal am to enter into a water purchase agreement for the gwr project and to construct a pipeline and pump station facilities and recover up to 50 million in associated costs subject to meeting certain criteria if construction costs exceed 50 million cal am would be allowed to seek additional cost recovery

a preliminary step to building the water supply project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well to confirm the suitability of the property on which intake wells will be located to draw water from under monterey bay in november 2014 the california coastal commission the “coastal commission” approved coastal development permits for the test slant well enabling cal am to construct the portion that will be under state lands beneath the ocean floor in january 2015 cal am obtained from the california state lands commission the “state lands commission” a required lease as to the state lands in october 2015 the coastal commission approved an amendment to cal am’s coastal development permits

in december 2014 the mcwd and the ag land trust an agricultural land conservancy filed petitions against the coastal commission and cal am which were ultimately transferred to the santa cruz county superior court seeking to vacate the coastal commission’s approval of the coastal development permit and to permanently restrain cal am and the coastal commission from constructing the test slant well pending full compliance with the california environmental quality act and the california coastal act the court denied these petitions and on january 11 2017 the supreme court of california denied mcwd’s petition for review of this decision mcwd filed a similar petition in january 2015 against the state lands commission and cal am which remains pending

in november 2015 mcwd filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in santa cruz county superior court against the coastal commission and cal am challenging the amendment of the coastal development permits and seeking an injunction against further test well pumping on september 15 2016 the court denied mcwd’s petition with respect to all claims except claims related to those raised in the december 2014 petitions discussed above

based on the foregoing cal am estimates that the earliest date by which the water supply project desalination plant could be completed is sometime in 2019 there can be no assurance that cal am’s application for the water supply project will be approved or that the water supply project will be completed on a timely basis if ever furthermore there can be no assurance that cal am will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order and the 2016 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to cal am or the company

west virginia elk river freedom industries chemical spill

background

on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances 4methylcyclohexane methanol or mchm and pphdipph a mix of polyglycol ethers into the elk river near the wvawc treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia after having been alerted to the leak of mchm by the west virginia department of environmental protection wvawc took immediate steps to gather more information about mchm augment its treatment process as a precaution and begin consultations with federal state and local public health officials as soon as possible after it was determined that the augmented treatment process would not fully remove the mchm a joint decision was reached in consultation with the west virginia bureau for public health to issue a “do not use” order for all of its approximately 93000 customer accounts in parts of nine west virginia counties served by the charleston treatment plant by january 18 2014 none of wvawc’s customers were subject to the do not use order

 

following the freedom industries chemical spill numerous lawsuits were filed against wvawc and certain other companyaffiliated entities collectively the “american water defendants” with respect to this matter in the us district court for the southern district of west virginia or w est virginia circuit courts in kanawha boone and putnam counties and to date 73 cases remain pending four of the cases pending before the us district court were consolidated for purposes of discovery and an amended consolidated class action complain t for those cases the “federal action” was filed in december 2014 by several plaintiffs on january 28 2016 all of the thenfiled state court cases were referred to west virginia’s mass litigatio n panel for further proceedings which have been stayed p ending the negotiation by the parties and approval by the court in the federal action of a global agreement to settle all of such cases as described below on july 7 2016 th e court in the federal action scheduled trial to begin on october 25 2016 but the court delayed the start of the trial pending ongoing settlement n egotiations between the parties and has since granted a continuance of the trial until march 21 2017 the mass litigation panel has also stayed its proceedings until may 1 2017 

wvawc binding global agreement in principle to settle claims

on october 31 2016 the court in the federal action approved the preliminary binding principles terms and conditions of the settlement among the american water defendants and all class members putative class members claimants and potential claimants collectively the “plaintiffs” arising out of the freedom industries chemical spill the terms of the settlement propose a global federal and state resolution of all litigation and potential claims against the american water defendants and their insurers a claimant may elect to opt out of any final settlement agreement in which case such claimant will not receive any benefit from or be bound by the terms of the settlement under the terms and conditions of the settlement and any subsequent final settlement agreement the american water defendants have not admitted and will not admit any fault or liability for any of the allegations made by the plaintiffs in any of the actions to be resolved

the proposed aggregate pretax amount of the settlement is 126 million of which 65 million would be contributed by wvawc and the remainder would be contributed by certain of the company’s general liability insurance carriers the company has general liability insurance under a series of policies underwritten by a number of individual carriers two of these insurance carriers which provide an aggregate of 50 million in insurance coverage to the company under these policies were requested but presently have not agreed to participate in the settlement the company and wvawc are vigorously pursuing their rights to insurance coverage from these nonparticipating carriers for any contributions by wvawc to the settlement in this regard wvawc filed a lawsuit against one of these carriers alleging that the carrier’s failure to agree to participate in the settlement constitutes a breach of contract and the company is pursuing mandatory arbitration against the other nonparticipating carrier despite these efforts the company may not ultimately be successful in obtaining full or further reimbursement under these insurance policies for amounts that wvawc may be required to contribute to the settlement

the preliminary terms of the settlement intend to establish a twotier settlement fund for the payment of claims comprised of i a simple claim fund which is also referred to as the “guaranteed fund” of 76 million of which 51 million will be contributed by wvawc including insurance deductibles and 25 million would be contributed by one of the company’s general liability insurance carriers and ii an individual review claim fund of up to 50 million of which up to 14 million would be contributed by wvawc and 36 million would be contributed by a number of the company’s general liability insurance carriers separately up to 25 million would be contributed to the guaranteed fund by another defendant to the settlement

as a result of these events the company recorded a charge to earnings net of insurance receivables of 65 million 39 million aftertax in the third quarter of 2016 the company intends to fund wvawc’s contributions to the settlement through existing sources of liquidity although no contribution by wvawc will be required unless and until the terms of the settlement are finally approved by the court in the federal action furthermore under the terms of the settlement wvawc has agreed that it will not seek rate recovery from the public service commission of west virginia for approximately 4 million in direct response costs expensed in 2014 by wvawc relating to the freedom industries chemical spill as well as for amounts paid by wvawc under the settlement

the company’s insurance policies operate under a layered structure where coverage is generally provided in the upper layers after claims have exhausted lower layers of coverage the 36 million to be contributed by a number of the company’s general liability insurance carriers to the individual review claim fund as noted above is from higher layers of the insurance structure than the two insurance carriers that were requested but presently have not agreed to participate in the settlement any recovery by wvawc or the company from the nonparticipating carriers would reimburse wvawc for its contributions to the guaranteed fund

following the court’s october 31 approval the parties have continued to negotiate the details of the settlement if preliminary approval of the settlement is obtained notice of the terms of the settlement would then be provided to members of the settlement class following the notice period the court in the federal action would hold a fairness hearing to consider final approval of the settlement there can be no assurance that the court in the federal action will provide its approval as to any agreement negotiated between the parties reflecting the terms of the settlement

 

the american water defendants believe that wvawc has responded appropriately to and other than through the settlement has no responsibility f or the freedom industries chemical spill and that the american water defendants have valid meritorious defenses to the lawsuits nevertheless wvawc and the company are unable to predict the outcome of any lawsuit against the american water defendants b rought or maintained by a claimant that elects to opt out of the settlement and any such outcome or outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation 

other related investigations

additionally investigations with respect to the matter have been initiated by the us chemical safety and hazard investigation board the “csb” the us attorney’s office for the southern district of west virginia the west virginia attorney general and the public service commission of west virginia the “psc” as a result of the us attorney’s office investigation freedom industries and six former freedom industries employees three of whom also were former owners of freedom industries pled guilty to violations of the federal clean water act 

in may 2014 the psc issued an order initiating a general investigation into certain matters relating to wvawcs response to the freedom industries chemical spill three parties intervened in the proceeding including the consumer advocate division of the psc and two attorneysponsored groups including one sponsored by some of the plaintiffs’ counsel involved in the civil litigation described above on january 26 2017 wvawc and the other parties agreed to resolve the general investigation and filed a joint stipulation with the psc containing the terms of the settlement the parties to the joint stipulation filed a proposed order with the psc on february 8 2017

the csb is an independent investigatory agency with no regulatory mandate or ability to issue fines or citations rather the csb can only issue recommendations for further action in response to the freedom industries chemical spill the csb commenced an investigation shortly thereafter on september 28 2016 the csb issued and adopted its investigation report in which it recommended that the company conduct additional source water protection activities the company provided written comments to the csb’s report suggesting that the recommendation made to the company would be better directed to the epa in order to promote industrywide implementation of the csb’s recommendation on february 15 2017 the company filed its response to the csb’s recommendation the csb has indicated that it may consider issuing a supplemental report on the freedom industries chemical spill

wvawc and the company are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing government investigations or any legislative initiatives that might affect wvawc’s water utility operations

general

periodically the company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business other than those proceedings described in this item 3—legal proceedings the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect its financial position or results of operations however litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance it is possible that some litigation and other proceedings could be decided unfavorably to the company and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

executive overview 

through its subsidiaries american water is the largest and most geographically diverse investorowned publiclytraded water and wastewater utility company in the united states as measured by both operating revenues and population served we employ approximately 6800 professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to an estimated 15 million people in 47 states the district of columbia and ontario canada our primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial and other customers including sale for resale and public authority customers our regulated businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation certain federal and state governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters our regulated businesses provide services in 16 states and serve approximately 33 million customers based on the number of active service connections to our water and wastewater networks we also operate several businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services in four operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with gaap these four nonreportable operating segments are collectively presented as our marketbased businesses which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses

 

2016 strategic focus  achievements 

for 2016 our focus was anchored on five central strategic themes 

























 











our adjusted om efficiency ratio for the year ended december 31 2016 was 349 compared to 359 and 367 for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the improvement in the 2016 adjusted om efficiency ratio over the 2015 ratio was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue the improvement in the 2015 adjusted om efficiency ratio over the 2014 ratio was attributable to both an increase in revenue and decreases in om expenses 

our adjusted om efficiency ratio is defined as our regulated om expenses divided by regulated operating revenues where both om expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense additionally from the om expenses we excluded the allocable portion of nonom support services cost mainly depreciation and general taxes that are reflected in the regulated businesses segment as om expenses but for consolidated financial reporting purposes are categorized within other line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in addition to the standard adjustments to the om efficiency ratio for the year ended december 31 2016 we have also excluded from operating revenues and om expenses the impact from the binding global agreement in principle related to the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia also for the year ended december 31 2014 we have also excluded from operating revenues and om expenses the estimated impact to revenue and om attributable to changes in consumption as a result of abnormal weather and the costs associated with the freedom industries chemical spill as applicable we excluded all the above items from the calculation as we believe such items are not reflective of management’s ability to increase efficiency of the company’s regulated operations

we evaluate our operating performance using this measure because management believes it is a direct measure of the improvement to the efficiency of our regulated businesses’ operations this information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance the om efficiency ratio is not a gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures and should not be used in place of the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report

 

the following table provides   the calculation and   reconciliation that compares om expense s and operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap to those amounts utilized in the calculation o f our   adjusted   om efficiency ratio for the   years ended   december 31 

 



 







 

2016 financial results 

highlights of our diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 are as follows

 



 





i ncome from continuing operations decreased 2 cents per diluted share or 08 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the prior year included in the 2016 amount was the aftertax charge of 39 million or 022 per diluted share resulting from the binding global agreement in principle related to the freedom industries chemical spill excluding this charge income from continuing operations increased 020 per diluted share or approximately 76 this increase was mainly due to continued strong growth in our regulated businesses for further detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations as well as the financial results of our business segments see “comparison of consolidated results of operations” and “segment results of operations” 

adjusted diluted earnings per share represents a nongaap financial measure and excludes the impact of the settlement we believe that this nongaap measure provides useful information by excluding such matters that may not be indicative of our ongoing operating results we believe this nongaap measure will allow for better evaluation of the operating performance of the business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of our results in the current year to those in prior years the nongaap financial information should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaap in addition our nongaap measure may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap measures of other companies 

 

regulatory matters 

the table below provides rate authorizations effective from 2014 through 2016 the table depicts annualized incremental revenues assuming a constant water sales volume 

 



 









 







on december 13 2016 we received a decision on our general rate case in illinois authorizing additional annualized revenues of 26 million effective on january 1 2017

on february 1 2016 cal am received approval from the cpuc to extend its cost of capital proceeding for an additional year subsequently cal am has requested to extend its current authorized cost of capital which is scheduled to expire on december 31 2017 for an additional year if no extension is received by march 31 2017 cal am will file its cost of capital application as scheduled 

during the first quarter of 2017 cal am received approval from the cpuc for step rates authorizing additional annualized revenues of 5 million effective on various dates between january 13 2017 and february 2 2017 

a number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to replace aging infrastructure the following table details additional annualized revenues authorized through infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that were effective from 2014 through 2016  

 



 















on december 2 2016 infrastructure charges amounting to additional annualized revenues of 2 million was approved for our west virginia subsidiary and became effective on january 1 2017 also on january 1 2017 1 million of additional annualized revenues from infrastructure charges for our pennsylvania subsidiary were authorized and became effective 

2016 pending rate cases and infrastructure charges

on april 1 2016 9 million in annualized revenues which was requested in our virginia general rate case that was filed on october 30 2015 was put into effect as interim rates under bond and subject to refund 

on april 29 2016 our new york subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting 9 million in additional annualized water revenues also on april 29 2016 our iowa subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting 5 million in additional annualized revenue on may 9 2016 2 million in additional annualized revenues of the 5 million requested in our iowa rate case were put into effect as interim rates under bond and subject to refund 

 

o n july 1 2016  our california subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting to increase revenues over three years this increase includes a request of 35 million of additional annualize d revenue which is expected to become effective on january 1 2018 as well as a step rate and attrition rate increase of 8 million in both 2019 and 2020 

on november 4 2016 our tennessee subsidiary filed for an infrastructure surcharge requesting additional revenues of 2 million on january 16 2017 our indiana subsidiary filed for an infrastructure surcharge requesting additional revenues of 8 million 

there is no assurance that all or any portion of these requests will be granted

other regulatory matters

on december 8 2016 the cpuc issued a final decision in regard to the application filed by cal am in july 2015 which requested changes to the then present rate design and the emergency conservation and rationing plan for water customers in certain areas within its monterey county service district the final decision allowed for i recovery of existing undercollections of the net water revenue adjustment mechanismmodified cost balancing account “wrammcba” balance amounting to approximately 32 million at december 31 2016 over 5 years earning interest at the 90day commercial paper rate and ii modification of existing conservation and rationing plans 

2017 and beyond 

we believe our success in the future will be driven by engaged employees smart investments and safe efficient operations leading to highly satisfied customers which in turn will lead to constructive regulatory outcomes and sustainable financial performance our future results will continue to be anchored on our five central themes with customers at the center of all we do these five central themes are our focus over the next five years















 

the chart below presents our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures over the period of 2017 to 2021 for improving infrastructure in our regulated businesses segment by purpose  

 



with respect to our adjusted om efficiency ratio goal for 2021 we are unable to provide without unreasonable efforts a quantitative reconciliation of each component of this ratio to the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap in calculating the components of the ratio certain items that may ultimately be excluded would be reflective of events that cannot be reasonably predicted at this time the unavailable information would include among other things the impact of items currently excluded from the calculation of the components adjustments for weather conditions that exceed a certain threshold of variability and adjustments for events or circumstances that may not be reflective of ongoing operating results the probable significance of these items is also presently unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated

 

 

 

consolidated results of operations

depreciation and amortization in 2016 and 2015 depreciation and amortization expense increased 30 million and 16 million or 68 and 38 respectively the increase for both periods was primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service also included in 2016 is incremental depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of keystone in the third quarter of 2015 

general taxes in 2016 general taxes increased 15 million or 62 due to higher gross receipt taxes and higher property taxes in our regulated businesses segment 

other income expenses in 2016 other expenses increased by 17 million or 58 principally due to an increase in interest expense from the issuance of incremental longterm debt as well as an increase in shortterm interest expense mainly due to higher levels of shortterm borrowings during 2016 coupled with an increase in the average shortterm borrowing rates in 2016 compared to 2015 

provision for income taxes in 2016 our provision for income taxes decreased by 4 million or 13 due primarily to the decrease in pretax income in 2015 our provision for income taxes increased 26 million or 93 due primarily to the increase in pretax income the effective tax rates were 392 391 and 394 for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively

segment results of operations 

our segments are determined based on how we assess performance and allocate resources we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources based on several factors with the primary measure being income from continuing operations

we conduct our business primarily through one reportable segment our regulated businesses segment we also operate businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services which includes four operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment these four nonreportable segments have been combined and are presented as marketbased businesses which is consistent with how management assesses the results of our businesses 

 

 

 

regulated businesses segment 

the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated businesses segment 

 



operating revenues the following tables and discussions provide explanation of the variances related to the three components of operating revenues––water revenues wastewater revenues and other revenues 

 



 



note the correlation between water service revenues and billed water sales volumes shown above is impacted by the california drought in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016 california experienced a severe drought in april 2015 the governor mandated water usage restrictions to reduce overall water usage by 25 in the state compared to 2013 levels revenue in california is decoupled from sales volume through the water revenue adjustment mechanism and the modified cost balancing account aligning our water conservation goals with those of the state and our customers and therefore usage reductions do not impact earnings

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate and monitor our cash requirements for capital investments acquisitions operations commitments debt maturities interest and dividends our business is capital intensive with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations when necessary we also obtain funds from external sources primarily in the debt markets and through shortterm commercial paper borrowings we also have access to equity capital markets if needed our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the utility and water utility industries in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas if these business market financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer are able to access the capital markets on reasonable terms we have access to an unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of 175 billion with an expiration date of june 2020 subject to extension by us for up to two oneyear periods we rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to support our commercial paper program disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets see “credit facility and shortterm debt” below for further discussion in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we through awcc our wholly owned financing subsidiary issue commercial paper which is supported by the revolving credit facility awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 88 million of outstanding letters of credit under its credit facility as of december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 awcc had 175 billion available under the credit facility that we could use to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit which supported our 849 million outstanding commercial paper we believe that our ability to access the capital markets our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our shortterm requirements we have no plans to issue equity under normal operating conditions in the foreseeable future with the limited exception of privately or investorowned tuckin acquisitions whose sellers require equity as necessary to complete the acquisition we believe we have sufficient liquidity and ability to manage our expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets however there can be no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from our regulated businesses rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines 

we use our capital resources including cash primarily to i fund operating and capital requirements ii pay interest and meet debt maturities iii pay dividends iv fund acquisitions and v fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations we invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where we expect to earn a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery generally takes place over an extended period of time and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag see item 1—business—operating segments—regulated businesses—economic regulation and rate making process we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greater than or equal to our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

if necessary the company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary in this event we believe we can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet our obligations and fund our minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

cash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by among other things economic utility regulation inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining customer usage of water employeerelated costs including pension funding weather and seasonality taxes and overall economic conditions 

 

cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requ irements make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditure requirements we expect to seek access to debt capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed we also have access to equity capital m arkets if needed operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner as such our working capital needs are primari ly limited to funding increases in customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues mainly associated with revenue increases in our regulated businesses we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the futu re sometimes our current liabilities exceed current assets because of the company’s debt due within one year and the periodic use of shortterm debt as a funding source pri marily to meet scheduled maturities of longterm debt as well as cash needs which can fluctuate significantly due to the seasonality of the business stage of our acquisitions and construction projects we address cash timing differences through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms  

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows provided by operating activities 

 



 





in 2016 cash flows provided by operations increased 97 million primarily due to an increase in net income after noncash adjustments and the impact of the binding global agreement in principle which is not expected to be paid until late 2017 or early 2018 and an increase in cash flows from working capital the main factors contributing to net income increase are described in this section under “comparison of consolidated results of operations” and included higher operating revenue partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense the increase in noncash activities was mainly the result of an increase in depreciation and amortization attributable to infrastructure investment projects placed into service the change in working capital was primarily the result of the following 1 a change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenues resulting from continuous improvement in our regulated businesses’ collection efforts as well as a decrease in unbilled revenues in our military services group attributable to lower capital upgrades in 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 2 timing of accounts payable and accrued liabilities and 3 change in other current assets and liabilities

 

in 2015 cash flows provided by operations increased 82 million primarily due to higher net income mainly as a result of improved operating performance the main factors of this increase are described in this section under “comparison of consolidated results of operations” and included higher operating revenue partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense the increase in noncash activities were mainly the result of an increase in pensionspostretirement benefit expense and higher deferred taxes pensionpostretirement benefit expense increased in 2015 due to changes in actuarial assumptions including the adoption of new mortality tables the increase in deferred taxes was due to accelerated tax depreciation related to infrastructure investments offsetting these increases was a decrease in working capital which was principally driven by an increase in receivables and unbilled revenues due to higher customer rates an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities most of which was associated with the timing of payments and increase in accrued insurance and a decrease in other current assets and liabilities net which is the result of an increase in the book overdraft liability in 2014 for which there was no comparable change in 2015 

the company expects to make pension and postretirement contributions to the plan trusts of 46 million in 2017 of which 11 million was already made in 2017 in addition we estimate that contributions will amount to 43 million in 2018 38 million in both 2019 and 2020 and 42 million in 2021 actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns among other factors 

 

cash flows used in investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows 

 



 



in 2016 and 2015 cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in our regulated capital expenditures principally from incremental investments associated with the replacement and renewal of our transmission and distribution infrastructure 

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures related to upgrading our infrastructure and systems 

 



 

in 2016 capital expenditures increased 151 million or 130 primarily due to the continued investment across the majority of our infrastructure categories 

in 2015 capital expenditures increased 204 million or 213 primarily due to continued investment across all infrastructure categories mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure 

we also grow our business through acquisitions of water and wastewater systems as well as other waterrelated services these acquisitions are complementary to our existing business and support continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt

the following provides a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities 

2016 







 

2015 







2014





as previously noted we expect to invest in the range of 67 to 73 billion from 2017 through 2021 in 2017 we estimate that our total capital expenditures will be 15 billion with 125 billion allocated to improving infrastructure in our regulated businesses segment and 220 million to 340 million for acquisitions and strategic capital investments including construction of our corporate headquarters building as discussed below 

we are moving forward with our plan to construct a new corporate headquarters to consolidate our support services and certain of our employees in our marketbased businesses within a single location on december 2 2016 we closed on the acquisition of the land on camden new jersey’s waterfront and began construction the cost of construction is currently estimated to be up to 165 million and exclusive of any tax incentives that the company may receive

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding infrastructure construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction net of refunds which amounted to 16 million for the year ended december 31 2016 and 26 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 based on the needs of our regulated subsidiaries and the company awcc may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then through intercompany loans provides those borrowings to the regulated subsidiaries and the company the regulated subsidiaries and the company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations because the company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated subsidiaries the company is not able to recover the interest charges on the company’s debt through regulated water and wastewater rates as of december 31 2016 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to our regulated businesses amounting to 36 billion and 600 million respectively additionally as of december 31 2016 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the company totaling 14 billion and 249 million respectively 

on march 24 2016 we entered into three forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 225 million to reduce interest rate exposure for a portion of the expected refinancing of our 6085 fixedrate longterm debt maturing in 2017 these forward starting swap agreements terminate in december 2017 and have an average fixed interest rate of 229 on july 1 2016 we entered into another forward starting swap agreement with a notional amount of 75 million at a 30year fixed rate of 192 to reduce the average 30year fixed rate on the total hedged notional amount of 300 million to 220 on february 8 2017 we entered into a forward starting swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million to reduce interest rate exposure for a portion of the expected refinancing of our 562 fixedrate longterm debt maturing in december 2018 this forward starting swap agreement terminates in november 2018 and has a fixed rate of 267 changes in the fair value of the forward starting swaps will be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the agreement’s termination date

in may 2015 the company and awcc filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement that enables us to meet our capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities including american water common stock preferred stock and other equity securities and awcc debt types of securities all subject to market conditions and demand general economic conditions and as applicable rating status the shelf registration will expire in may 2018 during 2016 2015 and 2014 550 million 550 million and 500 million respectively of debt securities were issued pursuant to this and predecessor registration statements

 

the following longterm debt was issued in 2016 

 



 



in addition to the above issuances we also assumed 6 million of debt as a result of an acquisition in 2016 which had a fixed interest rate of 100 and matures in 2037

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2016

 



 

 

the following longterm debt was issued in 2015 

 



 



in addition to the above issuances we also assumed 1 million of debt as a result of an acquisition in 2015 which has a fixed interest rate of 100 and matures in 2040 

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2015

 



 



 

the following longterm debt was issued in 2014 

 



 





in addition to the above issuances we also assumed 2 million of debt as a result of acquisitions in 2014 

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2014

 



 



from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements via tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

in february 2015 our board of directors authorized an antidilutive common stock repurchase program to mitigate the effect of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities the program allows the company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions the program is conducted in accordance with rule 10b18 of the exchange act and to facilitate the repurchases the company has also entered into a rule 10b51 share repurchase plans with a thirdparty broker which allows us to repurchase shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods subject to applicable regulations the company may elect to amend or cancel this repurchase program or the share repurchase parameters at its discretion as of december 31 2016 we have repurchased an aggregate of approximately 33 million shares of common stock under this program

credit facility and shortterm debt 

we have an unsecured revolving credit facility of 175 billion through june 2020 in march 2016 and under the terms of the revolving credit agreement dated june 30 2015 awcc exercised its right to increase its borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility from the aggregate maximum of 125 billion to 175 billion all other terms conditions and covenants with respect to the existing facility remained unchanged on june 30 2015 awcc and its lenders extended the termination date of the revolving credit facility from october 2018 to june 2020 this amended and restated agreement also allowed awcc to request to extend further the term of the credit facility for up to two oneyear periods an extension request must satisfy certain conditions and receive approval of the lenders as set forth in the agreement 

interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the eurodollar rate or base rate in accordance with awcc thenapplicable moody investors service or standard  poor’s ratings services credit rating at current ratings that spread would be 090 the facility is used principally to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 150 million in letters of credit indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between american water and awcc which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by american water of awcc’s payment obligations under the credit facility

 

awcc also has an outstanding commercial paper program that is backed by the revolving credit facility the maximum aggregate amount of which on march 22 2016 was increased from 10 billion to 16 billion 

keystone has its own line of credit facility with a maximum availability of up to 16 million dependent on a collateral base calculation borrowings under this facility are payable upon demand with interest being paid monthly interest accrues each day at a rate per annum equal to 275 above the greater of the one month or one day libor the borrowing base under the facility allows for financing up to the greater of the note or 80 of eligible accounts receivable based on the collateral assets at december 31 2016 6 million was available to borrow at december 31 2016 there were no outstanding borrowings 

the following table summarizes information regarding the company’s aggregate credit facility commitments letter of credit sublimits and available funds under those revolving credit facilities as well as outstanding amounts of commercial paper and outstanding borrowings under the respective facilities as of december 31 2016 and 2015

 



 

the weightedaverage interest rate on awcc shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 was approximately 078 and 049 respectively 

capital structure 

the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31

 



the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to an increase in the current portion of longterm debt

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance with these covenants an event of default may occur under one or more debt agreements and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue new debt or access our revolving credit facility our longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things prohibit or restrict the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations

covenants in certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization as defined in the relevant documents of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2016 our ratio was 058 to 100 and therefore we were in compliance with the covenants 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets may be directly affected by our securities ratings we primarily access the debt capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we have also issued debt through our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds to lower our overall cost of debt 

 

our longterm and shortterm credit rating and rating outlook as of december 31 2016 are as follows 

 



 

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that we provide collateral to secure our obligations we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends 

our board of directors authorizes the payment of dividends our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is subject to having access to sufficient sources of liquidity the net income and cash flows of our subsidiaries the receipt of dividends and repayments of indebtedness from our subsidiaries compliance with delaware corporate and other laws compliance with the contractual provisions of debt and other agreements and other factors the company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration among other factors current and possible future developments that may affect the company’s income and cash flows historically dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock are not cumulative only declared dividends are paid 

during 2016 2015 and 2014 we paid 261 million 239 million and 216 million in cash dividends respectively the following table summarizes the per share cash dividends paid for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014

 



 

on december 9 2016 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 0375 per share payable on march 1 2017 to stockholders of record as of february 7 2017 

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us furthermore the ability of our subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or repay indebtedness to american water is subject to compliance with applicable regulatory restrictions and financial obligations including for example debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as 

 

applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and other agreements or covenants made or entered into by american water and its subsidiaries 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims additionally annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going forward basis we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into contractual obliga tions with third parties in the ordinary course of business information related to our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 is summarized in the table below 

 



 

note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our marketbased businesses are not included in the above amounts also uncertain tax positions of 169 million are not reflected in this table as we cannot predict when open tax years will close with completed examinations see note 13—income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements















publicprivate partnerships 

wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs these payments are considered “pilot payments” which represent payments in lieu of taxes and approximate what wvawc otherwise would pay as property taxes 

 

on the properties we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities which is presented in property plant and equipme nt in the consolidated balance sheets was approximately 152 million as of december 31 2016 

performance obligations 

we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2065 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenues of 31 billion as of december 31 2016 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2015 and 2048 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 794 million as of december 31 2016 some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

our financial condition results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods judgments made include anticipated recovery of costs especially through regulated operations the likelihood of success of particular projects possible legal and regulatory challenges assumptions made in regards to pension and other benefit and forecast assumptions utilized in goodwill impairment testing our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee

for further information see note 2—significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

rate regulation and regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we follow the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated entities which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements use of the authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria i thirdparty regulation of rates ii costbased rates and iii a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service plus a return on net investment or rate base as of december 31 2016 we concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries met the criteria 

the application of the accounting principles has a further effect on the company’s financial statements as a result of the estimates of allowable costs used in the ratemaking process we make significant assumptions and estimates to quantify amounts recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities such judgements include but are not limited to assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions pension and postretirement benefits depreciation rates and taxes due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue these accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers regulators may also impose certain fines or penalties

as of december 31 2016 we have recorded 13 billion of regulatory assets and 403 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements see note 6—regulatory assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we assess at the end of each reporting period whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential legislation that could impact the ability to 

 

recover costs through regulated rates if subs equent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our statement of operations and financial position could be materially affected in addition if we conclude in a futur e period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets an d liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

the company has recorded 13 billion of goodwill at december 31 2016 and 2015 the company’s annual impairment test is performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual business plan the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary in performing a qualitative assessment the company assess and makes judgments among other things around macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance cost factors and entity specific events if an entity determines on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount no further testing is required if the entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative twostep fair valuebased test is performed 

the first step compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying values including goodwill on the measurement date if the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount for the reporting unit an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit management estimates fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples analysis significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include but are not limited to discount and growth rates and projected terminal values

for further information see note 7—goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these 

 

factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill to the end of the accounting period unbilled utility revenues as of december 31 2016 and 2015 were 161 million and 144 million respectively increases or decrease in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue 

revenue from marketbased businesses is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the costs incurred to date during the period compared to the total estimated costs over the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue unbilled marketbased revenues as of december 31 2016 and 2015 were 102 million and 123 million respectively billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

accounting for income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 

in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not morelikelythannot that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits no benefit is recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we conclude it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws our forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for our regulated businesses as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2016 and 2015 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 13—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation the pension plans were closed for most employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2006 are provided with a 525 of base pay defined 

 

contribution plan we also maintain other postretirement benefit plans which provide varying levels of medical and life insurance for eligible retirees these retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 the company also has several unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees the company does not participate in a multiemployer plan see note 14 — employee benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are develope d from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postreti rement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experien ce due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 











the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices we use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds the yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 428 466 and 424 at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 426 467 and 424 at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 702 for 2016 691 for 2015 and 691 for 2014 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 537 for 2016 492 for 2015 and 587 for 2014 

the asset allocations for the company’s us pension plan by asset category were as follows 

 



 

the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocations for the company’s other postretiremen t benefit plans by asset category were as follows 

 



 

the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 448 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 552 of the assets are valued using other inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 307 for 2016 310 for 2015 and 312 for 2014 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 650 in 2016 gradually declining to 500 in 2021 and thereafter 

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 



 

we will use a discount rate and eroa of 428 and 649 respectively for estimating our 2017 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and expected blended return based on weighted assets of 426 and 509 respectively for estimating our 2017 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2016 and 2015 pension and postretirement benefit costs were 54 million and 61 million respectively the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 39 million 37 million 38 million 38 million and 42 million in 2017 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

 

accounting for contingencies 

we record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the determination of a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter which may include an analysis of different scenarios liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible management considers many factors which include but are not limed to the nature of the litigation claim or assessment available information opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors and the experience gained from similar cases or situations we provide disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred we provide estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined either as a single amount or within a reasonable range 

actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recor ded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies see note 15—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2016 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in a 9 million increase in shortterm interest expense 

in july 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million this agreement effectively converted the interest on 100 million of outstanding 6085 fixed rate debt maturing 2017 to a variable rate of sixmonth libor plus 3422 we entered into this interest rate swap to mitigate interest cost at the parent company relating to debt that was incurred by our prior owners and was not used in any manner to finance the cash needs of our subsidiaries the interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 2 million for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 as the swap interest rates are fixed through april 2017 a hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rates associated with the interest rate swap agreement would result in a 1 million increase in interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016 this calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates 

the company has four forward starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of 300 million to reduce interest rate exposure on debt expected to be issued in 2017 the forward starting swap agreements terminate in december 2017 and have an average fixed rate of 220 when entering into forward starting interest rate swaps the company is subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate that impacts the fair value of the forward starting interest rate swaps we manage market risk by matching terms of the swaps with the critical terms of the expected debt issuance the fair value of the forward starting swaps at december 31 2016 was 27 million a hypothetical 100 adverse change in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our forward starting swaps of approximately 65 million at december 31 2016

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates in the next general rate case proceeding or other regulatory mechanism as authorized by each regulatory jurisdiction nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated services provided by our regulated businesses and ma rketbased businesses our regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while our marketbased businesses engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates in addition pension and other benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields 

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2016 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

business 

tableend

our company 

founded in 1886 american water works company inc the “company” or “american water” is a holding company incorporated in delaware american water is the largest and most geographically diverse investor owned publiclytraded united states water and wastewater utility company as measured by both operating revenues and population served we employ approximately 6700 professionals who provide drinking water wastewater and other related services to an estimated 15 million people in 47 states the district of columbia and ontario canada

operating segments

we conduct our business primarily through our regulated businesses segment we also operate several marketbased businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services which include four operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” these four nonreportable operating segments are collectively presented as our “marketbased businesses” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses additional information can be found in item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 19—segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

regulated businesses 

our primary business involves the ownership of subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater utility services to residential commercial industrial and other customers including sale for resale and public authority customers our subsidiaries that provide these services operate in approximately 1600 communities in 16 states in the united states and are generally subject to regulation by certain state commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation referred to as public utility commissions or “pucs” the federal and state governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters we report the results of the services provided by our utilities in our regulated businesses segment

our regulated businesses segment’s operating revenues were 2743 million for 2015 2674 million for 2014 and 2594 million for 2013 accounting for 868 888 and 901 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

the following table summarizes our regulated businesses’ operating revenues number of customers and estimated population served by state each as of december 31 2015









 

water supply and wastewater services 

our regulated businesses generally own the physical assets used to store pump treat and deliver water to our customers and collect treat transport and recycle wastewater typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law we are dependent on a defined source of water supply and obtain our water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams from ground water sources such as wells and water purchased from third party water suppliers 

the following chart depicts the sources of water supply as of december 31 2015

the percentages of finished water supply by source type for our top seven states based on our regulated businesses operating revenues for 2015 were as follows



our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate water supply drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water we employ a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas may mitigate some of the economic effect on the water supply associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service territory for example in any given summer some areas may experience drier than average weather which may reduce the amount of source water available while other areas we serve may experience wetter than average weather 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate water supply we use longterm planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development an example of our use of longterm planning to ensure that we have adequate water supply is our involvement in the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” in california the water supply project involves the construction of a desalination plant owned by californiaamerican water company our wholly owned subsidiary “cal am” which includes the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant the water supply project is intended among other things to fulfill obligations of cal am to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under orders of the california state water resources control board 

 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

economic regulation and rate making process 

the operations of our regulated businesses are generally subject to regulation and oversight by the pucs in each of the states served by our utilities with the primary responsibility of the pucs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs approve rates charged to customers accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital capital expenditures om expenses taxes transactions and affiliate relationships reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

the process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a rate case filed by the utility with the puc on a periodic basis the timing of rate case filings are typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions 

our rate case management program is guided by the principles of obtaining timely recovery of capital investment costs recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption and appropriate recovery of utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the program attempts to minimize the delay or “regulatory lag” between the time our regulated businesses make a capital investment or incur an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates the management team at each of our utilities understands the time required for the regulatory process and files rate cases with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective 

our regulated businesses support regulatory practices at the pucs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag examples of approved regulatory practices include



 

we pursue or seek enhancement to these regulatory practices as part of our rate case management program to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments in order to provide safe reliable and affordable services to our customers the ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept our proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these practices may reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate mak ing processes it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

we also support state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries legislation in certain states has generally enabled sales between interested parties has allowed a reasonable market valuation of purchased property and has enabled consolidation of water and wastewater rates

customers 

our regulated businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base a customer is a person corporation municipality or any other entity that purchases our water or wastewater system as of the last business day of a reporting period also a single customer may purchase our services for use by multiple individuals or businesses in the case of many homes apartment complexes businesses and governmental entities 

residential customers make up the majority of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate in 2015 residential customers accounted for 911 of our customer base 592 of the billed water sales and 560 of the operating revenues of our regulated businesses we also serve commercial customers such as offices retail stores and restaurants industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we also supply water through our distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities as well as to other water utilities in the form of bulk water supplies for distribution to their own customers

the vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water usage typically on a monthly basis we employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption these methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices touch read or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading our wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based on their water consumption 

the following table summarizes the number of water and wastewater customers we served by class as of december 31



customer growth in our regulated businesses is primarily driven by the following factors







generally we add customers through acquisitions of small and medium water andor wastewater systems in close geographic proximity to areas where we operate our regulated businesses which we refer to as “tuckins” the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using our existing management and to achieve operational efficiencies pursuing tuckins has been and continues to be a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate in certain united states markets where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses we will also selectively seek acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing and new markets before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for providing safe reliable and affordable services to our customers 

 

seasonality 

customer demand for our water service is affected by weather and is generally greater during the summer months primarily due to increased usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use as such we typically expect our operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year compared to any of the other quarters however varying summer weather conditions can impact our third quarter financial results summer weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues and operating income summer weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues and operating income

competition

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct competition in our existing markets because i we operate in those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a high barrier to market entry however our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors when pursuing acquisitions based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environnement company sa american states water company and california water service group from time to time we also face competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as algonquin power and utilities corp and corix

all or portions of our regulated subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods 







the acquisition consideration related to such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter

we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as developments occur we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses either individually or taken as a whole 

marketbased businesses 

through our marketbased businesses we provide services to military bases municipalities exploration and production companies commercial industrial and residential customers that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs and do not require substantial infrastructure investment for 2015 operating revenues for our marketbased businesses was 434 million or 137 of total operating revenues 

our marketbased businesses is comprised of four operating segments 









 

in november 2014 we disposed of our class b biosolids operating segment by selling our subsidiary terratec environmental ltd “terratec” which provided biosolids management trans port and disposal services to municipal and industrial customers in ontario canada the results of terratec are presented as discontinued operations and as such have been excluded from continuing operations and operating segment results for all periods presented see note 3—acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details on our discontinued operations 

military services group

our military services group has twelve 50year contracts with the us department of defense for the om of the water and wastewater systems on certain military bases all of these contracts may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to termination provisions applicable to these contracts we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs the contract price for nine of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions three contracts are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called “economic price adjustment” during the contract term we may make limited shortterm working capital investments under our contracts with the us department of defense 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group through our service line protection program provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers to protect against the cost of interior and external water and sewer line repairs and interior electric line repairs our linesaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipalities as of december 31 2015 our homeowner services group had approximately 16 million customer contracts in 43 states and the district of columbia 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including i om ii design build and operate and iii design build finance operate and maintain contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities the food and beverage industry and other customers we are party to 58 contracts varying in size and scope across the united states and canada ranging in terms from one to 30 years historically we have made minimal longterm capital investment under these contracts with municipalities and other customers instead we perform our services for a fee occasionally we provide our customers with financing for capital projects as part of a longterm operations and maintenance partnership 

keystone

our keystone business commenced in july 2015 through the acquisition of a ninetyfive percent interest in water solutions holdings llc including its wholly owned subsidiary keystone clearwater solutions llc collectively referred to as “keystone” keystone is a water management solution company currently focused on exploration and production companies in the appalachian basin keystone primarily provides customized water sourcing transfer storage transport and pipeline construction services for natural gas exploration and production companies as of december 31 2015 keystone served 46 customers 

competition 

we face competition in our marketbased businesses from a number of service providers including veolia environnement american states water company operations management international inc and southwest water company particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competitive as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as the municipal and industrial fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process 

our homeowner services group faces competition primarily from homeserve usa and utility service partners inc 

keystone currently faces competition from water service providers that typically provide particular segments of the water management cycle such as rockwater energy solutions select energy services and fluid delivery solutions llc

 

industry and regulatory matters 

overview 

the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in need of modernization and replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of water and wastewater residuals’ discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization in 2007 the us environmental protection agency the “epa” estimated that approximately 3900 billion of capital spending would be necessary over the then next 20 years to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states in 2011 the epa also estimated that the nation’s drinking water utilities need 3842 billion in infrastructure investments for thousands of miles of pipe as well as thousands of treatment plants storage tanks and other key assets between 2011 and 2030 to ensure the public health security and economic wellbeing of our cities towns and communities additionally in 2013 the american society of civil engineers “asce” published its report card for america’s infrastructure in which it gave the water and wastewater infrastructure a grade of “d” because much of the infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life the asce report concluded that there will be an investment gap between 2013 and 2020 of 84 billion for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations including the services provided by both our regulated businesses and marketbased businesses are subject to extensive us federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge recycle and dispose of wastewater these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other us federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we also are subject to various us federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently the overall trend has been that they have become increasingly stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could increase we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our operations are subject in the past our regulated businesses have generally been able to recover costs associated with compliance related to environmental health and safety standards however this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery we estimate that we will make capital expenditures of 42 million during 2016 and 89 million during 2017 for environmental control facilities which we define for this purpose as any project or portion thereof that involves the preservation of air water or land

 

we maintain an environmental program including responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural re sources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples from across our water systems are analyzed on a regular basis for compliance with regulatory requirements across our company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2015 we achieved a score of greater than 99 for drinking water compliance and according to the epa’s statistics america n water’s performance has been far better than the industry average over the last several years in fact in 2015 american water was 13 times better than the industry average for compliance with drinking water requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 68 of our 81 surface water plants receiving the program’s “director” award which recognizes utilities that have completed a comprehensive selfassessment report created an action plan for continuous improvement and produces high quality drinking water we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 64 american water plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award while 59 have been awarded the “tenyear phase iii” award additionally 25 plants received the inaugural “fifteenyear phase iii” award which recognizes plants that have met the director award status for 15 years 

safe drinking water act 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns to date the epa has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water further certain of our water systems have recently completed the process of monitoring for 28 additional contaminants that are not currently regulated to help the epa determine if any of them occur at high enough levels to warrant being regulated there are thousands of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources the epa also revised the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule in 2007 and congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act in january 2011 regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings or fixtures solder and flux in 2012 the epa finalized revisions to the total coliform rule that were part of the mandate of a federal advisory committee appointed to negotiate the changes most of the anticipated changes to the rule will be effective in april 2016 the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds we do not anticipate that any of these regulations will require implementation in 2016 in july 2014 the state of california implemented a primary drinking water standard of 10 micrograms per liter for hexavalent chromium we are in compliance with this new standard

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act and other similar laws to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by the state pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act which must be renewed every five years pursuant to the npdes permit program the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems discharges that exceed the limits specified under npdes permits can lead to the imposition of penalties and persistent noncompliance could lead to significant penalties and compliance costs in addition the difficulty of obtaining complying with npdes permits and renewing expiring permits may impose time and cost burdens on our operations from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals which generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 “cercla” authorizes the epa and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites as well as the owners and operators of such sites may be deemed liable without regard to fault under cercla or comparable state laws although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the us occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see item 1—business—research and development 

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters further description of these proceedings can be found in item 3—legal proceedings

research and development 

we have a research and development program which seeks to improve water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our business our research and development personnel are located in new jersey in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports our research and development activities through testing and analysis 

we continue to collaborate with the epa to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship includes sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa provides us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

approximately onequarter of our research budget is funded by competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers in 2015 we spent 4 million including 1 million funded by research grants spending net of research grant funding amounted to 3 million in 2014 and 2013 

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical for providing safe reliable and affordable services as well as maintaining our leadership position in the industry which provides us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

 

support services 

our american water works service company subsidiary provides support services and corporate governance for our operating subsidiaries these services are provided predominantly to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these subsidiaries that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services are also provided to our marketbased businesses organized under american water enterprises they are only provided to keystone upon request these services which are provided at cost may include accounting and finance administration business development communications education and training engineering health and safety human resources information systems internal audit investor relations legal operations procurement rates support security risk management treasury water quality and research and development we also operate two national customer service centers which are located in alton illinois and pensacola florida that provide customer relations operations and field service support the services are provided at cost and enable our regulated businesses and marketbased businesses to fulfill their responsibilities in a more costeffective manner 

our security department provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing implementing monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required vulnerability assessments are conducted periodically to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility information security controls are deployed or integrated as a preventative measure against unauthorized access to company information systems these controls are aimed at assuring the continuity of business processes that are dependent upon automation seek to ensure the integrity of our data support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements and aimed at maintaining safe and reliable service to our customers while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs we are in contact with us federal state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply 

employee matters 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 46 of our workforce is represented by unions as of that date we had 75 collective bargaining agreements in place with 17 different unions representing our unionized employees also we have 4 union contracts beyond expiration that affect approximately 700 employees all of which are actively working under the old agreements during 2016 32 of our local union contracts will expire 

on october 13 2014 we entered into a settlement agreement with the utility workers union of america “uwua” designed to resolve a dispute between our company and the labor unions representing employees in the regulated businesses the “unions” among other things the settlement agreement provides for a new 20142018 national benefits agreement that will be in effect generally until july 31 2018 in addition we agreed to make a 10 million lumpsum payment to be distributed in accordance with procedures set forth in the settlement agreement 

the unions approved the settlement agreement on october 30 2014 and the national labor relations board the “nlrb” approved the settlement agreement on october 31 2014 we the nlrb and the uwua filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the petition for review the seventh circuit voluntarily dismissed all the parties appeals on december 16 2014 in 2015 the nlrb dismissed the unfair labor practice charge pending on the national benefits dispute upon receipt of our 10 million lumpsum payment 

the majority of the distributions were used to reimburse active employees for medical claims which were incurred during the relevant period and were funded by the group insurance plan for active employees of american water works company inc and its designated subsidiaries and affiliates to which we previously made contributions

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business operations

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation by state pucs and other regulatory agencies which significantly affects our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our utility operations also may be subject to fines penalties and other sanctions for the inability to meet these regulatory requirements

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to economic regulation by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly our rate increase requests may or may not be approved or may be partially approved and any approval may not occur in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to







approval of the pucs is also required in connection with other aspects of our utilities’ operations state pucs are empowered to impose financial penalties fines and other sanctions for noncompliance with applicable rules and regulations our utilities are also required to have numerous permits approvals and certificates from the pucs that regulate their businesses although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business

in any of these cases our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to if water usage is less than the level anticipated in establishing rates or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than the level estimated in establishing rates

 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations compliance with increasingly stringent laws and regulations could impact our operating costs and violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs 

our water and wastewater operations as well as the operations of our marketbased businesses are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include cercla the clean water act and the safe drinking water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations for example cercla authorizes the epa to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions with respect to actual or threatened releases of hazardous substances and can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties for the costs thereof we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations 

in addition state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water

 

for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an octo ber 20 2009 cease and desist order the “2009 order” of the california state water resources control board that requires cal am to significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule presently running throu gh december 31 2016 the “2016 deadline” we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act in november 2015 cal am filed an application with the state water resour ces control board to modify the 2009 order to extend the deadline for compliance to december 31 2020 we cannot predict whether cal am will be able to extend the 2016 deadline or secure alternative sources of water or if cal am will be exposed to liabili ties if it is unable to meet the 2016 deadline under the 2009 order if cal am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business fina ncial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected see item 3 — legal proceedings in this report which includes additional information regarding this matter 

the current regulatory rate setting structure may result in a significant delay also known as “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can address these events through the rate case application process our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business

there is typically a delay known as “regulatory lag” between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

we endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing positive regulatory policies for example seven state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs or property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the rate case application process while these programs have been a positive development and we continue to seek expansion of programs to mitigate regulatory lag some state pucs which govern our regulated operations have not approved such programs furthermore pucs may fail to adopt new surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form or at all furthermore no state has adopted surcharge programs that include all elements of cost that may change between general rate proceedings although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful or even if successful they may not completely address our regulatory lag in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected

changes in laws and regulations over which we do not control and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others











 















any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters may disrupt our operations and economic conditions may reduce the demand for water services either of which could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas these include winter storms and freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornados earthquakes landslides coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains and severe electrical storms weather events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage for example in october 2012 our east coast subsidiaries were affected by hurricane sandy the most significant impact to our business was caused by the widespread power outages caused by the storm’s heavy winds rain and snow in addition adverse economic conditions can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas if a regional drought were to occur governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system for example as a result of a fouryear period of reduced rainfall and overall dry conditions throughout the state of california cal am has been closely monitoring its owned and purchased water supplies in april 2015 the governor of california mandated water usage restrictions to reduce overall water usage by 25 in the state compared to 2013 usage levels although such restrictions are scheduled to expire in february 2016 the governor of california issued an executive order in november 2015 extending the restrictions through october 31 2016 if drought conditions persist through january 2016 while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans in cal am’s districts are generally recoverable provided the california public utilities commission the “cpuc” determines they were reasonable cal am cannot assure that such expenses will in fact be fully recovered moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future changing severe weather patterns could require additional expenditures to reduce the risk associated with any increasing storm flood and drought occurrences the issue of climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide many climate change predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities such as increased frequency and duration of droughts increased precipitation and flooding potential degradation of water quality and changes in demand for services because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate change we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

 

our reg ulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2015 we invested 12 billion in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems could increase in the future we expect to fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt we may not be able to access the debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all

in addition we could be limited in our ability to both pursue growth and pay dividends in accordance with our dividend policy in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we expect that we will need additional financing 

the ability to obtain financing at reasonable rates is contingent upon our credit ratings and general market conditions if we do not obtain sufficient financing we could be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays labor shortages or other disruptions environmental restrictions or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our water service and our revenues

demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months demand tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows moreover if we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow or disposal operations our losses might not be covered by insurance and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

contamination of our sources of water could result in service limitations and interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and could subject our subsidiaries to reduction in usage and other responsive obligations government enforcement actions and private litigation

the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants and are then delivered into our distribution system are subject to contamination including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether chemical spills or other accidents that result in contaminants entering the water source and possible terrorist attacks if one of our water supplies is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include among other things 1 continuing limited use of the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply if service is disrupted our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods we may be unable to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates or recovery of these costs may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 

 

in this regard on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances into the elk river near t he wvawc treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia wvawc has and may continue to incur significant costs in responding to this incident and may not be able to recover such costs through rates or from insurers even if recovery is possible it ma y not occur in a timely manner government investigations relating to the freedom industries spill have been initiated state laws have been enacted state and federal legislatures are considering changes to existing laws or rules associated with new laws and there are 68 currently pending lawsuits against wvawc and in a few cases against us or our affiliates while american water and wvawc believe that wvawc has responded appropriately to and has no responsibility for the freedom industries spill and american water and wvawc believe they and other affiliates have valid meritorious defenses to the lawsuits wvawc will incur defense costs that may not be recoverable moreover an adverse outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adve rse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation wvawc and american water are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing government investigations or any legislative initiatives that might affect water u tility operations see item 3 — legal proceedings for additional information regarding this matter 

since we engage in the business of providing drinking water to our customers contamination of the water supply can result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured

we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize potential liabilities arising from our utility operations as well as the operations of our marketbased businesses our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make generally our insurance policies cover property damage worker’s compensation employer’s liability general liability terrorism risks and automobile liability each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims as a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles 

we are subject to adverse publicity and reputational risks which make us vulnerable to negative customer perception and could lead to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions 

water and wastewater utilities including our regulated subsidiaries have a large consumer customer base and as a result are exposed to public criticism regarding among other things the reliability of their water and wastewater services the quality of water provided and the timeliness and accuracy of bills that are provided for such services adverse publicity and negative consumer sentiment may render legislatures and other governing bodies state pucs and other regulatory authorities and government officials less likely to view companies such american water and its regulated subsidiaries in a favorable light and may cause american water and its regulated subsidiaries to be susceptible to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes as well as increased regulatory oversight and more stringent regulatory requirements unfavorable regulatory outcomes may include the enactment of more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations as well as fines penalties or other sanctions or requirements the imposition of any of the foregoing could have a material negative impact on american water and each of our regulated subsidiaries’ business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

the properties of our regulation businesses segment include 81 dams a failure of any of which could result in personal injury and downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail materi al costs although in most cases the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future the inability to recov er these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems any further acquisitions we undertake may involve risks further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and strategic and financial buyers may hinder our ability to grow our business

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we may not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and strategic and financial buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 

the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in among other things





















some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to finance our business pay dividends and to comply with regulatory requirements the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions in addition our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities adjacent to or near our existing service areas thereby impairing our ability to geographically expand the affected service areas competing governmental entities utilities environmental or social 

 

activist groups and strategic and financial buyers have challenged and may in the future challenge our eff orts to acquire new companies andor service areas our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new companies andor service areas with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations an y of these risks may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain or other similar authorized process

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain or another similar authorized process should a municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain or such other process either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition we may resist the acquisition

contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain or other process or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated businesses’ management from the operation of its business moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation or process may not be successful

if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain or other process there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges

we rely on technology to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business

our technology systems particularly our information technology “it” systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations for example we depend on our it systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections our it systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers while we completed in the fourth quarter of 2013 the business transformation implementation for our enterprise resource planning enterprise asset management “eam” and customer information “cis” systems and we are in the process of implementing a similar system for our american water enterprises business a number of our mission and business critical it systems are older such as our scada supervisory control and data acquisition system although we do not believe that our it systems are at a materially greater risk of cybersecurity incidents than other similar organizations our it systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from













these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and other adverse consequences in addition the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us

in addition we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency

 

we may be subject to physical andor cyber attacks 

as operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical andor cyber attacks our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes our corporate and information technology systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes unauthorized access to confidential information located or stored on these systems could negatively and materially impact our customers employees suppliers and other third parties

if despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred we could have our operations disrupted property damaged and customer information stolen experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss and be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations and cash flows

our inability to efficiently optimize and stabilize new it systems could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability

over the past several years we have implemented and are in the process of implementing with respect to our american water enterprises business improvements to our business processes and upgrading our legacy core information technology systems these enterprisewide initiatives support our broader strategic initiatives and are intended to optimize workflow throughout our field operations improve our backoffice operations and enhance our customer service capabilities any technical or other difficulties in optimizing and stabilizing new it systems and other technology may increase the costs of the project beyond those anticipated and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting although efforts are being made to minimize any adverse impact on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated

as we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project

we operate numerous it systems that are in various stages of integration sometimes leading to inefficiencies therefore delays in stabilization and optimization of these systems will also delay cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the project we may also experience difficulties consolidating our current systems moving to a common set of operational processes and implementing a successful change management process these difficulties may impact our ability to meet customer needs efficiently any such delays or difficulties may have a material and adverse impact on our business client relationships and financial results

our business has inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to financial losses as well as penalties and other liabilities

our safety record is critical to our reputation we maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers vendors and the public although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards it is unlikely that we will be able to avoid accidents at all times 

our business sites including construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment moving vehicles pressurized water chemicals and other regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others our employees and others may be injured or die unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

in addition our operations can involve the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly handled stored or disposed of could subject us to penalties or other liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability

 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 46 of our workforce was represented by unions and we had 75 collective bargaining agreements in place with 17 different unions representing our unionized employees these collective bargaining agreements are subject to periodic renewal and renegotiation we may not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are fair to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

financial and marketrelated risks

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs

as of december 31 2015 our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 66 billion and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including















in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new shortterm and longterm debt securities moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2016 2017 and 2018 will be 54 million 573 million and 457 million respectively we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all moreover if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms

we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt reduce capital investments sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our financial condition operating results and prospects to be affected adversely

 

our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longte rm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations we rely primarily on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external sources of shortterm liquidity are our commercial paper program and our 125 billion revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility expires in accordance with its terms in june 2020 we regularly use our commercial paper program under this revolving credit facility as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we generally can obtain in the commercial paper market as of december 31 2015 american water capital corp “awcc” our wholly owned financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and had 626 million of commercial paper outstanding and 82 million in outstanding letters of credit 

disruptions in the capital markets could limit our ability to access capital while our credit facility lending banks have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments our lenders may not meet their existing commitments and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all furthermore our inability to maintain renew or replace commitments under this facility could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital and credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures

any impediments to our access to the capital markets or failure of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely and materially affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

american water may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay upstream dividends or repay funds to american water

american water is a holding company and as such american water has no operations of its own substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by subsidiaries american waters ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and their ability to pay upstream dividends to american water or repay indebtedness to american water prior to funding american water american water’s regulated subsidiaries must comply with regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied including among others debt service and preferred and preference stock dividends as well as applicable corporate tax and other laws and regulations and agreements and covenants made by american water and its subsidiaries american waters subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide american water with funds an inability of any of these subsidiaries to pay such dividends or repay intercompany obligations could have a material adverse impact on american waters liquidity and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock and meet its other obligations

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards

as of december 31 2015 we had us federal and state net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 11 billion and 534 million respectively our federal nol carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028 and our state nol carryforwards began to expire in 2016 and will continue to expire until 2034 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income our management believes the federal nol carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and therefore currently require no valuation allowance at december 31 2015 60 million of the state nol carryforwards have been offset by a valuation allowance because we do not believe these nols will more likely than not be realized in the future and we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our nols the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of the nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include 13 billion of goodwill at december 31 2015 the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 and the acquisition of keystone which was completed in july 2015 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance or the performance of an acquired business these market conditions could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that compares unfavorably to our peer companies decreases in control premiums or with respect to keystone fluctuations in the level of exploration and production activities in the marcellus and utica shale regions served by keystone a prolonged depression of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our forecast operating results cash flows or key assumptions in the future a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of goodwill would result in a charge to income in the period in which the impairment occurred which may negatively affect our financial condition results of operations and total capitalization the effects of any such impairment could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators

market conditions may impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions and increasing trends in health care costs may also increase our funding requirements future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows

additional risks related to our marketbased businesses

we excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our marketbased businesses including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients which may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased businesses do not satisfy these obligations

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased businesses including financial guarantees or deposits in the event our marketbased businesses fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected

at december 31 2015 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 36 billion and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased businesses expand the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms

 

american water enterprises’ longterm contracts with the department of defense may be terminated for the convenience of the us government and are subject to periodic contract price redetermination 

all of our contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

american water enterprises operates a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and faces the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems which may negatively affect american water enterprises as the operators of the systems

american water enterprises operates a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts american water enterprises operates the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements in some cases american water enterprises may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on american water enterprises as the operator of the system and us and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to us to the same extent as if we were the owner 

our marketbased businesses are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received

some of our marketbased businesses enter into longterm contracts under which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee these marketbased businesses are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

keystone’s operations may expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental laws and matters

keystone’s operations and the operation generally of natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities by keystone’s customers are subject to stringent federal state and local laws rules regulations and ordinances governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection these provisions may require the acquisition by keystone of permits or licenses before providing its services to customers prohibit the release of substances defined thereunder as hazardous in connection with these activities and impose substantial liabilities for the violation thereof that may result from these operations failure to comply with these laws rules regulations and ordinances may result in substantial environmental remediation and other costs to keystone the assessment of administrative civil and criminal penalties or the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting certain activities under existing environmental laws and regulations keystone could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from its operations or whether its operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed while the company has attempted to structure and maintain its ownership and control of keystone’s operations in such a way as to insulate the company its regulated subsidiaries and its marketbased businesses from any liabilities associated with keystone’s operations including liabilities for environmental matters there can be no assurance that such efforts will be sufficient to prevent the company from incurring liability for the operations of keystone

changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently and any changes to these or other laws governing the natural gas and oil exploration industry that result in more stringent or costly water or wastewater handling storage transport disposal or cleanup requirements could require keystone to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance with such requirements may harm keystone’s business and results of operations by reducing the demand for keystone’s water and related services and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on keystone’s competitive position financial condition results of operations and cash flows

alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

in 1995 the california state water resources control board issued an administrative order the “1995 order” requiring cal am to implement an alternative water supply in lieu of diversions from the carmel river in response to claims that cal am had not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by the 1995 order the state water resources control board adopted the 2009 order finding that cal am had not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river as required by the 1995 order the 2009 order requires among other things that cal am significantly decrease its yearly diversions from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule through december 31 2016 at which point all unpermitted diversions must end failure to effect the decrease in diversions mandated by the 2009 order could result in substantial penalties

in december 2010 the cpuc approved the regional desalination project the “rdp” involving the construction of a desalination facility in the city of marina north of monterey the rdp was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cal am the rdp was intended to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the carmel river as required under the 1995 order and the 2009 order in addition to other obligations 

the rdp was subject to delay due to among other things funding delays and investigations and inquiries initiated by public authorities relating to an alleged conflict of interest concerning a former member of the mcwra board of directors the “former director” in july 2011 mcwra advised mcwd and cal am that the agreements were void as a result of the conduct of the former director on september 28 2011 cal am terminated the agreements as a result of mcwra’s anticipatory repudiation of the agreements by stating they were void following unsuccessful mediation efforts cal am publicly announced that it had withdrawn support of the rdp in july 2012 the cpuc closed the proceedings relating to the rdp and stated that it would examine the recoverability of costs related to the rdp in other proceedings

 

in december 2012 cal am mcwra and the county of monterey entered into a settlement agreement under which cal am will forgive approximately 19 million loaned by cal am under the agreements and cal am will make additional payments of up to a pproximately 15 million to mcwra on april 15 2015 the cpuc issued a final decision approving in part the settlement agreement by authorizing cal am’s recovery of 19 million of costs advanced to mcwra the cpuc denied without prejudice the recovery of approximately 765 thousand due to insufficient information for the cpuc to determine the reasonableness of such amount cal am may file another application for recovery at a future date on april 17 2015 mcwd filed an application with the cpuc for a rehearing of the settlement approval which was denied on october 22 2015 on november 20 2015 mcwd filed with the california supreme court a petition for writ of review of the cpuc approval and the order denying mcwd’s rehearing application 

in october 2012 cal am filed a complaint for declaratory relief the “2012 complaint for declaratory relief” in the monterey county superior court subsequently transferred to the san francisco county superior court against mcwra and mcwd seeking a determination by the court as to whether the agreements are void as a result of the former director’s alleged conflict of interest or remained valid on june 1 2015 the court entered its final judgment declaring that four of the five agreements are void and one the credit line agreement is not void the “void judgment” on june 30 2015 mcwd filed its notice of appeal of the void judgment the court awarded cal am approximately 14 million in costs and attorneys’ fees in connection with the 2012 complaint for declaratory relief appeals of these awards remain pending

on july 1 2015 cal am and mcwra filed a complaint subsequently amended on july 17 2015 the “cal am complaint” in san francisco county superior court against mcwd and rmc water and environment a private engineering consulting firm “rmc” seeking to recover compensatory consequential and incidental damages associated with the failure of the rdp which have been alleged in the cal am complaint to be in excess of 100 million as well as punitive and treble damages statutory penalties and attorneys’ fees on july 30 2015 mcwd filed a complaint the “mcwd 2015 complaint” in san francisco county superior court against cal am mcwra and certain unidentified individual defendants mcwd is seeking to recover compensatory damages associated with the failure of the rdp in an amount to be proven at trial which have been alleged in the mcwd 2015 complaint to be at least 180 million as well as exemplary damages and attorneys’ fees on august 12 2015 rmc filed a complaint for damages the “rmc complaint” and together with the cal am complaint and the mcwd 2015 complaint collectively the “damages actions” in san francisco county superior court against cal am and mcwra seeking to recover damages associated with the failure of the rdp of at least 697 thousand plus an unspecified amount of punitive damages against cal am on december 16 2015 the court issued an order granting a motion by rmc to consolidate the damages actions and a motion by mcwd to stay the damages actions pending the resolution of the appeal of the void judgment

in april 2012 cal am filed an application with the cpuc for approval of the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” the water supply project involves construction of a desalination plant owned by cal am intended to reduce water diversions from the carmel river in addition the water supply project may include cal am’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” between the monterey regional water pollution control agency “mrwpca” and the monterey peninsula water management district “mpwmd” the desalination plant size is expected to vary depending on whether the gwr project is included without the gwr project included a 96 million gallon per day “mgd” plant size is proposed and with the gwr project included a 64 mgd plant size is proposed the water supply project also would involve aquifer storage and recovery through an existing aquifer storage and recovery program between cal am and the mpwmd 

in july 2013 cal am entered into a settlement agreement with 15 other parties that have intervened in the cpuc proceedings with respect to the water supply project including several monterey county government entities the office of ratepayer advocates of the cpuc and several interest groups the “wsp settlement” under the wsp settlement the parties have agreed on several matters relating to the water supply project the wsp settlement is subject to the pending approval of the cpuc 

a preliminary step to building the water supply project desalination plant is the construction and operation of a test slant well as well as monitoring well clusters to confirm the suitability of the property on which permanent intake wells will be located to draw water from under monterey bay the site of the test slant well is on a property owned by one or more affiliates of cemex inc collectively “cemex” cal am and cemex have entered into an agreement under which cal am acquired a temporary investigative easement to construct and operate the test slant well and a four year option to purchase a permanent easement for construction and operation of slant wells and related pipelines for the water supply project on portions of the cemex property when the final configuration of the new wells are approved by the california coastal commission the “coastal commission” 

in november 2014 the coastal commission approved a coastal development permit for the test slant well on the cemex property and a second coastal development permit enabling cal am to construct the portion of the test slant well that will be under state lands beneath the ocean floor provided that cal am acquires a lease from the california state lands commission the “state lands commission” which owns the state lands the state lands commission executed the required lease on january 22 2015 on october 6 2015 the coastal commission approved an amendment to cal am’s permits to operate the test slant well on the cemex property

 

in december 2014 each of mcwd and the ag land trust an agricultural land conservancy filed petitions collectively the “ test slant well petitions” against the coastal commission and cal am which were ultimately transferred to the jurisdiction of the santa cruz county superior court these petitions sought among other things a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the co astal commission to vacate its decision to approve the coastal development permit relating to the cemex property and a permanent injunction restraining cal am and the coastal commission from taking any action to implement the test slant well project pend ing full compliance with the california environmental quality act “ceqa” and the california coastal act the “coastal act” after a trial on the merits the court denied the test slant well petitions in their entirety mcwd has appealed this decision w hich appeal remains pending 

on january 15 2015 mcwd filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in santa cruz county superior court against the state lands commission and cal am the “january 2015 petition” seeking relief similar to that sought in its test slant well petition on october 1 2015 pursuant to a stipulation among the parties the court entered an order staying a hearing on the january 2015 petition until the appeal regarding the denial of mcwd’s test slant well petition is resolved

on november 5 2015 mcwd filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against the coastal commission and cal am challenging the october 6 2015 amendment by the coastal commission of the permits to operate the test slant well and seeking the issuance of an injunction against further test well pumping until this petition is resolved this proceeding remains pending

in addition to the foregoing matters cal am’s ability to move forward on the water supply project is subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc review by other government agencies of necessary permit applications and intervention from other parties including some that are not participants in the wsp settlement on august 19 2015 the statutory deadline for resolving the application related to the water supply project was extended to december 31 2016 and a procedural schedule was subsequently approved calling for evidentiary hearings to be held in april 2016 with cpuc action on the gwr project anticipated to occur as early as august 2016 on january 22 2016 cal am submitted testimony that it had reached substantial completion of a water purchase agreement with mrwpca and mpwmd for the gwr project which if approved by the cpuc would result in the smaller plant size of 64 mgd based on the foregoing cal am estimates that the earliest date by which the water supply project desalination plant could be completed is sometime in 2018 there can be no assurance that cal am’s application for the water supply project will be approved or that the water supply project will be completed on a timely basis if ever 

the projected completion date of the water supply project is beyond the december 31 2016 deadline for cal am to terminate unpermitted diversions from the carmel river and cal am does not expect to have sufficient other alternative sources of water available by the december 31 2016 deadline as a result on november 20 2015 cal am along with several monterey county government agencies filed an application with the state water resources control board to modify the 2009 order to extend the deadline for compliance to december 31 2020 there can be no assurance that the deadline will be extended or that cal am will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to us while cal am believes that its discussions with the state water resources control board staff have been constructive there can be no assurance that the deadline will be extended 

overflow of diesel fuel tank

on march 2 2015 virginiaamerican water company “vawc”  hopewell district had an overflow of a diesel fuel day tank at its low lift pump station located along the appomattox river in hopewell virginia approximately 500 gallons of diesel fuel overflowed the day tank and onto the ground and a portion of the fuel ultimately entered the river vawc notified first responders and retained clean harbors an emergency response company to control the overflow area and perform cleanup at the site and in the river on march 4 2015 the epa issued an emergency removalresponse administrative order directing the performance by vawc of removal actions to mitigate the release vawc and clean harbors conducted removal efforts under the order subject to oversight by the epa and the virginia department of environmental quality “vdeq” and on may 11 2015 the epa issued a notice of completion of the work required under the order vawc also has received and responded to a request from the epa for information regarding the overflow of the diesel fuel tank

on april 1 2015 vdeq issued a notice of violation “nov” alleging violations arising from this incident without providing a specific fine or penalty amount the nov also alleged violations relating to discharges of chlorinated water into the river that were identified during the course of the response to the hopewell diesel overflow vawc has taken steps to prevent any potential for such discharges going forward in the second quarter of 2015 vdeq issued to vawc a consent order and assessed a civil charge of approximately 20 thousand with respect to this matter vawc has signed the consent order and paid the civil charge

 

west virginia elk river freedom industries chemical spill 

on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances 4methylcyclohexane methanol or mchm and pphdipph a mix of polyglycol ethers into the elk river near the wvawc treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia after having been alerted to the leak of mchm by the west virginia department of environmental protection “dep” wvawc took immediate steps to gather more information about mchm augment its treatment process as a precaution and begin consultations with federal state and local public health officials as soon as possible after it was determined that the augmented treatment process would not fully remove the mchm a joint decision was reached in consultation with the west virginia bureau for public health to issue a “do not use” order for all of its approximately 93000 customer accounts in parts of nine west virginia counties served by the charleston treatment plant the order addressed the use of water for drinking cooking washing and bathing but did not affect continued use of water for sanitation and fire protection over the next several days wvawc and an interagency team of state and federal officials engaged in extensive sampling and testing to determine if levels of mchm were below one part per million 1 ppm a level that the us centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and epa indicated would be protective of public health beginning on january 13 2014 based on the results of the continued testing the do not use order was lifted in stages to help ensure the water system was not overwhelmed by excessive demand which could have caused additional water quality and service issues by january 18 2014 none of wvawc’s customers were subject to the do not use order although cdc guidance suggesting that pregnant women avoid consuming the water until the chemicals were at nondetectable levels remained in place in addition based on saved samples taken on or before january 18 2014 pphdipph was no longer detected in the water supply as of january 18 2014 on february 21 2014 wvawc announced that all points of testing throughout its water distribution system indicated that levels of mchm were below 10 parts per billion 10 ppb the interagency team established 10 ppb as the “nondetect” level of mchm in the water distribution system based on the measurement capabilities of the multiple laboratories used wvawc continued to work with laboratories to test down to below 2 ppb of mchm and announced on march 3 2014 that it had cleared the system to below this level

to date there are 68 pending cases against wvawc with respect to this matter in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia or west virginia circuit courts in kanawha boone and putnam counties fiftythree of the state court cases naming wvawc and one case naming both wvawc and american water works service company inc “awwsc” and together with wvawc and the company the “american water defendants” were removed to the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia on december 17 2015 the federal district court entered orders remanding 52 of the previously removed cases back to the west virginia circuit courts for further proceedings two of the previously removed cases had been dismissed in the interim following that order seven additional cases were filed against wvawc in west virginia circuit courts in kanawha and putnam counties with respect to this matter on january 28 2016 all of the state court cases were referred to west virginia’s mass litigation panel for further proceedings

four of the cases pending before the federal district court were consolidated for purposes of discovery and an amended consolidated class action complaint for those cases the “federal action” was filed on december 9 2014 by several plaintiffs who allegedly suffered economic losses loss of use of property and tap water or other specified adverse consequences as a result of the freedom industries spill on behalf of a purported class of all persons and businesses supplied with using or exposed to water contaminated with crude mchm and provided by wvawc in logan clay lincoln roane jackson boone putnam and kanawha counties and the culloden area of cabell county west virginia as of january 9 2014 the amended consolidated complaint names several individuals and corporate entities as defendants including the american water defendants the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages for alleged business or economic losses unspecified damages or a mechanism for recovery to address a variety of alleged costs loss of use of property personal injury and other consequences allegedly suffered by purported class members punitive damages and certain additional relief including the establishment of a medical monitoring program to protect the purported class members from an alleged increased risk of contracting serious latent disease

on april 9 2015 the court in the federal action denied a motion to dismiss all claims against the company for lack of personal jurisdiction a separate motion to dismiss filed by awwsc and wvawc and joined by the company asserting various legal defenses in the federal action was resolved by the court on june 3 2015 the court dismissed three causes of action but denied the motion to dismiss with respect to the remaining causes of actions and allowed the plaintiffs to continue to pursue the various claims for damages alleged in their amended consolidated complaint 

on july 6 2015 the plaintiffs in the federal action filed a motion seeking certification of a class defined to include persons who resided in dwellings served by wvawc’s kanawha valley treatment plant “kvtp” on january 9 2014 persons who owned businesses served by the kvtp on january 9 2014 and hourly employees who worked for such businesses the plaintiffs sought a classwide determination of liability against the american water defendants among others and of damages to the three groups of plaintiffs as a result of the “do not use” order issued after the freedom industries spill

a courtdirected mediation was held at the end of september 2015 with the assistance of private mediators representatives of the american water defendants eastman chemical the federal action plaintiffs and the plaintiffs in the 53 state court cases as to which removal to federal court had been sought as well as insurance carriers for certain of the defendants participated in the mediation no resolution was reached and no further mediation discussions have been scheduled to date

 

on october 8 2015 the court in the federal action granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs’ class certification motion the court certified a class addressing the alleged fault of eastman chemical for tort claims and the alleged fault of the american water defendants for tort and breach of contract claims as well as the comparative fault of freedom industries how ever the court granted the joint motion by defendants to exclude certain expert testimony disallowing the testimony of plaintiffs’ economic damages experts and denied class certification as to any damages including punitive damages thus determination or quantification of damages if any would be made in subsequent proceedings on an individual basis 

on december 17 2015 the court in the federal action entered a scheduling order that provides for the trial on class issues to begin in july 2016 during the first week of january 2016 three additional cases were filed against one or more of the american water defendants as well as others in the us district court for the southern district of west virginia with respect to this matter

general

periodically the company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations however litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance it is possible that some litigation and other proceedings could be decided unfavorably to us and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

2015 strategic focus  achievements 

for 2015 our focus was anchored on five central strategic themes 

























2015 financial results 

for the year ended december 31 2015 we grew income from continuing operations more than 10 while making capital investment in our infrastructure and implementing operational efficiency improvements to keep customer rates affordable 



i ncome from continuing operations increased 25 cents per diluted share for year ended december 31 2015 compared to the prior year excluding the 2014 costs related to the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia of 4 cents per diluted share income from continuing operations increased 21 cents per diluted share or about 88 the increase was mainly due to continued growth in both our regulated businesses segment and marketbased businesses 

discontinued operations represents the 2014 sale of our terratec line of business which was part of our marketbased businesses the loss from discontinued operations net of tax reflected in the 2014 financial results includes the loss on the sale an income tax valuation allowance and the 2014 operating results of the entity prior to the sale

see “comparison of consolidated results of operations” and “segment results” below for further detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations as well as our business segments all financial information in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects continuing operations unless otherwise noted see note 3—acquisitions and divestitures in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our discontinued operations 

 

regulatory matters 

the table below provides rate authorizations effective from 2013 through 2015 the table depicts annualized incremental revenues assuming a constant water sales volume

















on april 30 2015 our west virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting 36 million in additional annualized water and wastewater revenues on july 31 2015 our missouri subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting 25 million in additional annualized revenue lastly on october 30 2015 our virginia subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting 9 of additional annualized revenue 

in july 2015 cal am filed an application with the cpuc to request changes to the present rate design and the emergency conservation and rationing plan for water customers in certain areas within its monterey county service district if approved the proposed changes would allow i recovery of existing undercollections of the net water revenue adjustment mechanismmodified cost balancing account “wrammcba” balance amounting to approximately 51 million as of december 31 2015 over 20 years earning a pretax rate of 841 ii an annual consumption trueup mechanism and rate design that provide for more timely collection of the cost of service and iii modification of existing conservation and rationing plans on november 4 2015 cal am received an assigned commissioner’s scoping memo and ruling “memo” related to our wram filing the memo called for the suspension of the wram surcharges related to 2013 and 2014 undercollections and required cal am to retain an independent accounting firm to verify the actual customer water usage and billed revenue for the monterey county service district for years ended december 31 2013 and 2014 the results of the auditors verification was filed with the cpuc in january 2016 on february 1 2016 cal am filed a motion with the cpuc to restart the surcharge collections for 2013 and 2014 

on february 16 2016 the commission’s office of ratepayer advocates “ora” issued a report on cal am’s requests to address monterey rate design and the historical wram balances the ora recommends a disallowance of 17 million of the monterey wram balance and also recommends that the amortization occur over five years with no interest additionally the ora recommends the cpuc deny cal ams request for annual consumption true up pilot program we are in the process of reviewing the ora proposal and will submit our response on march 4 2016 however we do not believe that the ora proposals have merit we expect a cpuc decision in mid to late 2016 

on december 30 2015 our indiana subsidiary filed a rate case trueup for additional annualized revenues in the amount of 2 million which were authorized and effective on january 29 2016 on january 21 2016 our illinois subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an additional 40 million in annualized revenues on january 29 2016 our kentucky subsidiary filed a general rate case requesting an additional 14 million in annualized water revenues on february 1 2016 cal am received approval from the cpuc to extend its cost of capital proceeding for an additional year as such cal am’s current cost of capital will remain in place through 2017

a number of states have authorized the use of regulatory mechanisms that permit rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs and investments such as infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that permit recovery of capital investments to 

 

replace aging infrastructure the following table detai ls additional annualized revenues authorized through infrastructure surcharge mechanisms that were effective from 2013 through 2015  

















on december 15 2015 our pennsylvania subsidiary filed for additional annualized revenues from infrastructure charges in the amount of 11 million which were authorized and effective on january 1 2016 on december 18 2015 our illinois subsidiary filed for additional annualized revenues from infrastructure charges in the amount of 1 million which were authorized and also effective on january 1 2016 on january 14 2016 our indiana subsidiary filed for additional annualized revenues from infrastructure charges in the amount of 3 million 

as of february 24 2016 we are awaiting final general rate case orders in five states requesting additional annualized revenue of 123 million we are also awaiting approval of 5 million in additional annualized revenues for infrastructure charges there is no assurance that all or any portion of these requests will be granted

technology and operational efficiency – continuing improvement in om efficiency ratio for our regulated businesses

we continued to improve on our om efficiency ratio our adjusted om efficiency ratio for the year ended december 31 2015 was 359 compared to 367 for the year ended december 31 2014 the improvement in the 2015 om efficiency ratio over this period was attributable to both an increase in revenue and decreases in om expenses

we evaluate our operating performance using this measure because management believes it is a direct measure of the efficiency of our regulated businesses’ operations this information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance the om efficiency ratio is not a gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures and should not be used in place of the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report

our om efficiency ratio is defined as our regulated om expenses divided by regulated operating revenues where both om expenses and operating revenues were adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense additionally from the om expenses we excluded the allocable portion of nonom support services cost mainly depreciation and general taxes that are reflected in the regulated businesses segment as om expenses but for consolidated financial reporting purposes are categorized within other line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in addition to the standard adjustments to the om efficiency ratio for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we have also excluded from operating revenues and om expenses the estimated impact from changes in consumption as a result of weather and the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia as applicable we excluded all the above items from the calculation as we believe such items are not reflective of management’s ability to increase efficiency of the company’s regulated operations

the following table provides the calculation and reconciliation that compares om expenses and operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap and to those amounts utilized in the calculation of our adjusted om efficiency ratio for the years ended december 31

2016 and beyond 

our future results continue to be anchored on the five central themes noted for 2015 with customers at the center of all we do these five central themes are

consolidated results of operations 

the following table presents our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 



comparison of consolidated results of operations 

operating revenues in 2015 operating revenues increased 148 million or 49 primarily due to a 





 



in 2014 consolidated operating revenues increased 132 million or 46 primarily due to an 





operation and maintenance  in 2015 operation and maintenance expense increased 54 million or 40 primarily due to a 







in 2014 operation and maintenance expense increased 61 million or 47 primarily due to a





depreciation and amortization in 2015 and 2014 depreciation and amortization expense increased 16 million and 17 million or 38 and 42 respectively the increase for both periods was primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service 

other income expenses in 2014 other expenses decreased by 47 million or 138 primarily due to the recognition of a pretax loss on debt extinguishment in 2013 of 41 million in connection with the cash tender offer for our 6085 senior notes due 2017 also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in interest expense resulting from interest savings as a result of our 2014 and 2013 refinancings partially offsetting these decreases was a reduction in allowance for funds used during construction which was mainly attributable to our customer information and enterprise asset management systems being placed into service in 2013 

provision for income taxes in 2015 and 2014 our provision for income taxes increased 26 million and 43 million or 93 and 181 respectively due primarily to the increase in pretax income the effective tax rates were 391 394 and 390 for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

in december 2015 the accelerated tax benefit for bonus depreciation was legislatively extended for 20152019 bonus depreciation applies to certain qualified capital investments placed into service and allows for a bonus depreciation provision of 50 from 2015 through 2017 40 in 2018 and 30 in 2019 we have federal nol carryforwards of 11 billion as of december 31 2015 as such the election of bonus depreciation will be annually determined on a state by state basis and will include among other items an evaluation of our ability to utilize our federal nol carryforwards charitable contribution carryforwards and state regulatory practices if we elect bonus depreciation for all years we would not expect to pay federal income taxes until 2021

loss from discontinued operations net of tax as previously noted the financial results of our terratec line of business within our marketbased businesses was classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented the sale of terratec was completed in 2014 the 2014 loss from discontinued operations net of tax includes the loss on sale a tax valuation allowance and operating results 

segment results of operations 

our segments are determined based on how we assess performance and allocate resources we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources based on several factors with the primary measure being income from continuing operations

we conduct our business primarily through one reportable segment our regulated businesses segment we also operate businesses that provide a broad range of related and complementary water and wastewater services in nonregulated markets which 

 

includes four operating segments that individually do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment these four nonreportable segments have been combined and are presented as marketbased businesses which is consistent with how management assesses the results of our businesses  

regulated businesses segment 

the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated businesses segment 



operating revenues the following tables and discussions provide explanation of the variances related to the three components of operating revenues––water revenues wastewater revenues and other revenues 



 





in 2015 water revenues increased 61 million or 24 primarily due to a











in 2014 water revenues increased 66 million or 27 primarily due to an

 









in 2015 and 2014 wastewater revenues increased primarily due to incremental revenues resulting from acquisitions

in 2015 and 2014 other revenues increased primarily due to incremental revenues for late payments and reconnection fees as well as insurance proceeds in 2014 for business interruption as a result of hurricane sandy 

operation and maintenance the following tables and discussions provide a detailed explanation of the variances related to the major components of operation and maintenance in 2014 operation and maintenance was impacted by incremental costs of 10 million related to the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia which included 6 million in other operation and maintenance 3 million in operating supplies and services and 1 million in employeerelated costs 



production costs

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate and monitor our cash requirements for capital investments acquisitions operations commitments debt service and dividends our business is capital intensive with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations when necessary we also obtain funds from external sources primarily in the debt markets and through shortterm commercial paper borrowings we also have access to equity capital markets if needed our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the utility and water utility industries in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas if these business market financial and other conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer are able to access the capital markets on reasonable terms we have access to an unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of 125 billion with an expiration date of june 2020 subject to extension by us for up to two oneyear periods we rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to support our commercial paper program disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets see “credit facility and shortterm debt” below for further discussion in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we through awcc our wholly owned financing subsidiary issue commercial paper which is supported by the revolving credit facility awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 82 million of outstanding letters of credit under its credit facility as of december 31 2015 as of december 31 2015 awcc had 125 billion available under the credit facility that we could use to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit which supported our 626 million outstanding commercial paper we believe that our ability to access the capital markets our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our shortterm requirements we have no plans to issue equity under normal operating conditions with the limited exception of privately or investorowned tuckin acquisitions whose sellers require equity as necessary to complete the acquisition we believe we have sufficient liquidity and ability to manage our expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets however there can be no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

 

in addition our regulated subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by a dvances and contributions is excluded from the rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines 

we use our capital resources including cash primarily to i fund operating and capital requirements ii pay interest and meet debt maturities iii pay dividends iv fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and v fund acquisitions we invest a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where we expect to earn a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag see item 1—business—operating segments—regulated businesses—economic regulation and rate making process we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since we expect our capital investments over the next few years to be greater than or equal to our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

if necessary the company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary in this event we believe we can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet our obligations and fund our minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

cash flows provided by operating activities 

cash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows provided by operating activities will be affected by among other things economic utility regulation infrastructure investment inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining customer usage of water employeerelated costs including pension funding weather and seasonality and overall economic conditions 

cash flows provided by operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditure requirements we expect to seek access to debt capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed we also have access to equity capital markets if needed operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner as such our working capital needs are primarily limited to funding increases in customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues mainly associated with revenue increases in our regulated businesses we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future we address cash timing differences through the liquidity funding mechanisms discussed above

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows provided by operating activities 







in 2015 cash flows provided by operations increased 82 million primarily due to higher net income compared to the same period in 2014 

 

in 2014 cash flows provided by operations increased 201 million primarily due to an improvement in the cash collections of our regulated businesses’ accounts receivable some of which were unbilled at december 31 2013 cash collections in 2013 for our r egulated businesses’ accounts receivable were slower than historical payment patterns mainly due to the implementation of our cis system in may 2013 we implemented the cis system in our remaining regulated businesses in october 2013 and experienced a sim ilar slowdown in cash collections for these operating companies in 2014 

the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 55 million in 2016 of which 9 million was already made in 2016 in addition we estimate that contributions will amount to 61 million in 2017 79 million in 2018 93 million in 2019 and 103 million in 2020 actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns among other factors 

cash flows used in investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows 





in 2015 and 2014 cash flows used in investing activities increased primarily due to an increase in our regulated capital expenditures principally from incremental investments associated with the replacement and renewal of our transmission and distribution infrastructure 

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures related to upgrading our infrastructure and systems 



in 2015 capital expenditures increased 204 million or 213 primarily due to continued investment across all infrastructure categories mainly replacement and renewal of transmission and distribution infrastructure 

in 2014 capital expenditures decreased 24 million or 25 primarily due to the completion of phase i and phase ii of our business transformation project in 2013 partially offset by increased infrastructure investment

 

we also grow our business through acquis itions of water and wastewater systems as well as other waterrelated services these acquisitions are complementary to our existing business and support continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are fund ed initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt 

the following provides a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities 

2015







2014





2013





as previously noted we expect to invest 64 billion from 2016 through 2020 in 2016 we estimate that our total capital expenditures will be 13 billion with 12 billion allocated to improving infrastructure in our regulated businesses segment and 100 million for acquisitions and strategic capital investments 

we are currently considering a plan to construct a new corporate headquarters to consolidate our support services and certain of our employees in our marketbased businesses within a single location we are considering several locations within camden new jersey for the new headquarters the cost of construction which would take several years to complete is currently estimated to be up to 165 million depending on the location selected and exclusive of any tax incentives that the company may receive

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding infrastructure construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions in aid of construction net of refunds which amounted to 26 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 and 19 million for the year ended december 31 2013 based on the needs of our regulated subsidiaries and the company awcc may borrow funds or issue its debt in the capital markets and then through intercompany loans provides those borrowings to the regulated subsidiaries and the company the regulated subsidiaries and the company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations because the company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated subsidiaries the company is not able to recover the interest charges on the company’s debt through regulated water and wastewater rates as of december 31 2015 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to our regulated businesses amounting to 33 billion and 284 million respectively additionally as of december 31 2015 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the company totaling 12 billion and 344 million to the company respectively 

 

on may 7 2015 the company and awcc filed with the sec a universal s helf registration statement that enables us to meet our capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities including american water common stock preferred stock and other equity securities and awcc debt types of securities all subject to market conditions and demand general economic conditions and as applicable rating status the shelf registration will expire in may 2018 during 2015 2014 and 2013 550 million 500 millio n and 400 million respectively of debt securities were issued pursuant to this and predecessor registration statements 

the following longterm debt was issued in 2015 





in addition to the above issuances we also assumed 1 million of debt as a result of an acquisition in 2015 which has a fixed interest rate of 100 and matures in 2040 

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2015 





the following longterm debt was issued in 2014 







in addition to the above issuances we also assumed 2 million of debt as a result of acquisitions in 2014 

 

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2 014 





the following longterm debt was issued in 2013









in addition to the above issuances we also assumed 13 million of debt as a result of acquisitions in 2013 most of which is associated with the dale service corporation stock acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2013 

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2013 







on november 1 2013 we issued notices of redemption for 75 million and 75 million of outstanding senior notes with an original maturity date of 2038 and interest rates of 825 and 100 respectively these notes were retired on december 1 2013 

also on december 21 2013 an additional 101 million in senior notes with an interest rate of 539 matured

 

from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements via tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

in february 2015 our board of directors authorized an antidilutive common stock repurchase program to mitigate the effect of shares issued through our dividend reinvestment employee stock purchase and executive compensation activities the program allows the company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions the program is conducted in accordance with rule 10b18 of the exchange act and to facilitate the repurchases the company has also entered into a rule 10b51 share repurchase plan with a thirdparty broker which allows us to repurchase shares at times when we may otherwise be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods subject to applicable regulations the company may elect to amend or cancel this repurchase program or the share repurchase parameters at its discretion as of december 31 2015 we have repurchased an aggregate of approximately 23 million shares of common stock under this program

in june 2015 awcc amended and restated the outstanding credit agreement dated as of october 29 2012 associated with the 125 billion aggregate commitment in unsecured revolving credit facility to extend the expiration date of the facility from october 2018 to june 2020 and to allow awcc to request to extend further the term of the credit facility for up to two oneyear periods an extension request must satisfy certain conditions and receive approval of the lenders as set forth in the agreement interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the eurodollar rate or base rate with the credit spread based awcc’s moody’s investors service which we refer to as moody’s or standard  poor’s ratings services ratings which we refer to as sp credit rating at current ratings that spread would be 090 the facility is used principally to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 150 million in letters of credit indebtedness under the facility is considered “debt” for purposes of a support agreement between american water and awcc which serves as a functional equivalent of a guarantee by american water of awcc’s payment obligations under the credit facility

also the company acquired an additional revolving line of credit as part of its keystone acquisition the total commitment under this credit facility was 16 million of which 2 million was outstanding as of december 31 2015

the following table summarizes information regarding the company’s aggregate credit facility commitments letter of credit sublimits and available funds under those revolving credit facilities as well as outstanding amounts of commercial paper and outstanding borrowings under the respective facilities as of december 31 2015 and 2014 



the weightedaverage interest rate on awcc shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 was approximately 049 and 031 respectively interest accrues on the keystone revolving line of credit daily at a rate per annum equal to 275 above the greater of the one month or one day libor

capital structure 

the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31 



the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to changes in outstanding commercial paper balances 

 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance with these covenants such an event may create an event of default under the debt agreement and we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue new debt or access our revolving credit facility for two of our smaller operating companies we have informed our counterparties that we will provide only unaudited financial information at the subsidiary level which resulted in technical noncompliance with certain of their reporting requirements under debt agreements with respect to 8 million of outstanding debt we do not believe this event will materially impact us our longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things limit the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions our failure to comply with any of these covenants could accelerate repayment obligations

certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization as defined in the relevant documents of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2015 our ratio was 056 to 100 and therefore we were in compliance with the covenant 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets may be directly affected by our securities ratings we primarily access the debt capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we have also issued debt through our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds to lower our overall cost of debt 

on may 7 2015 standard and poor’s “sp” raised our corporate credit rating on awcc and american water from a to a and our commercial paper rating from a2 to a1 on american water and awcc sp also confirmed its stable rating outlook on august 7 2015 moody’s upgraded the longterm ratings for american water and awcc from baa1 to a3 at the same time moody’s also affirmed awcc’s commercial paper rating at p2 moody’s rating outlook for american water and awcc remains as stable 

our longterm and shortterm credit ratings as of december 31 2015 are as follows 



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that we provide collateral to secure our obligations we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends 

our board of directors authorizes the payment of dividends the payment of dividends is subject to sufficient liquidity dividends from subsidiaries etc the company’s dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration among other factors current and possible future developments that may affect the company’s income and cash flows historically dividends have been paid quarterly to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock are not cumulative only declared dividends are paid 

 

during 2015 2014 and 2013 we paid 239 million 216 million and 150 million in cash dividends respectively for 2015 we paid a cash dividend of 034 per share on december 1 september 1 june 1 and 031 per share on march 2 in 2014 we paid a cash dividend of 031 per shar e on december 1 september 2 june 2 and 028 on march 3 in 2013 we paid a cash dividend of 028 per share on december 2 september 3 and june 3 

on december 11 2015 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 034 per share payable on march 1 2016 to shareholders of record as of february 8 2016 

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims additionally annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going forward basis we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into contractual obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business information relat ed to our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 is summarized in the table below 



note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our marketbased businesses are not included in the above amounts also uncertain tax positions of 233 million are not reflected in this table as we cannot predict when open tax years will close with completed examinations see note 13—income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements













 



publicprivate partnerships 

wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs these payments are considered “pilot payments” which represent payments in lieu of taxes and approximate what wvawc otherwise would pay as property taxes on the properties we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities which is presented in property plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets was approximately 156 million as of december 31 2015 

performance obligations 

we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2065 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenues of 28 billion as of december 31 2015 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2015 and 2048 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 795 million as of december 31 2015 some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

our financial condition results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we follow the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated entities which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements use of the authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria i thirdparty regulation of rates ii costbased rates and iii a reasonable assumption that rates will be set to recover the estimated costs of providing service plus a return on net investment or rate base as of december 31 2015 we concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries met the criteria 

due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue these accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by an unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers regulators may also impose certain fines or penalties

 

as of december 31 2015 we have recorded 13 billion of net regulatory assets and 402 million of regulatory liabilitie s within our consolidated financial statements see note 6—regulatory assets and liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we assess at the end of each reporting period or earlier if appropriate whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential legislation that could impact the ability to recover costs through regulated rates if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our statement of operations and financial position could be materially affected in addition if we conclude in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

goodwill 

the company has recorded 13 billion and 12 billion of goodwill at december 31 2015 and 2014 the company’s annual impairment test is performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual business plan the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

entities assessing goodwill for impairment have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary in performing a qualitative assessment the company assess among other things macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations overall financial performance cost factors and entity specific events if an entity determines on the basis of qualitative factors that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount no further testing is required if the entity bypasses the qualitative assessment or performs the qualitative assessment but determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount a quantitative twostep fair valuebased test is performed 

the first step compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective net carrying values including goodwill on the measurement date if the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual assets and liabilities using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount for the reporting unit an impairment loss is recorded as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of the reporting unit management estimates fair value using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples analysis significant assumptions used in these fair value analyses include but are not limited to discount and growth rates and projected terminal values

excluding goodwill acquired in 2015 related to the keystone acquisition the company determined that no qualitative factors were present that would indicate the estimated fair values of its reporting units were less than the respective carrying values as such the company determined that the twostep goodwill impairment test was not necessary at november 30 2015 further no triggering events occurred which required an impairment evaluation between the annual testing dates

the company recorded goodwill of 91 million as part of the keystone acquisition the keystone business is an operating segment comprised of one reporting unit to which all of the goodwill arising from the acquisition was assigned a step one test was completed for the keystone goodwill we used an income approach valuation technique which estimates the discounted future cash flows of operations the discounted cash flow analysis relies on a single scenario reflecting the best estimate of projected cash flows significant assumptions were used in estimating the fair value including the discount rate growth rate and terminal value the estimated fair value of the keystone reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 3 and as such the company does not believe the goodwill is impaired if a further decline in the fair value were to occur the keystone reporting unit would be at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test

no impairment charge was recorded for goodwill for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 or 2013

 

there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities and reporting unit companies the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies decreases in control premiums or continued downward pressure on commodity prices a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge in regards to the keystone goodwill adverse developments in market conditions including pr olonged depre ssion of natural gas prices or other factors that negatively impact our forecast operating results cash flows or key assumptions in the future could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of the goodwill balance 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill to the end of the accounting period unbilled utility revenues as of december 31 2015 and 2014 were 267 million and 221 million respectively increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue 

revenue from marketbased businesses is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the costs incurred to date during the period compared to the total estimated costs over the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

accounting for income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 

 

in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance we a ccount for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 like ly of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not morelikelythannot that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits no benefit is recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is i ncluded on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial stat ements 

we evaluate the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we conclude it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws our forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies recovery of taxes through the regulatory process for our regulated businesses as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2015 and 2014 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 13—income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation the pension plans were closed for most employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2006 are provided with a 525 of base pay defined contribution plan we also maintain other postretirement benefit plans which provide varying levels of medical and life insurance for eligible retirees these retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 the company also has several unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees the company does not participate in a multiemployer plan see note 13 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 











 

the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretir ement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices we use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ ex pected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds the yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callabl e with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determ ining pension benefit obligations was 466 424 and 512 at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 467 424 and 510 at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 resp ectively 

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 691 for 2015 691 for 2014 and 749 for 2013 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 492 for 2015 587 for 2014 and 699 for 2013 

the asset allocations for the company’s us pension plan by asset category were as follows 



the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocations for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans by asset category were as follows 



the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 456 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 544 of the assets are valued using other inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 310 for 2015 312 for 2014 and 315 for 2013 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 675 in 2015 gradually declining to 500 in 2021 and thereafter 

 

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a on epercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 



we will use a discount rate and eroa of 466 and 702 respectively for estimating our 2016 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and eroa of 467 and 520 respectively for estimating our 2016 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2015 and 2014 pension and postretirement costs including such expenses charged to our discontinued operations were 61 million and 24 million respectively the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 55 million 61 million 79 million 93 million and 103 million in 2016 2017 2018 2019 and 2020 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

accounting for contingencies

we record loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the determination of a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates about the likely outcome of the matter which may include an analysis of different scenarios liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change in assessing whether a loss is reasonably possible management considers many factors which include but are not limed to the nature of the litigation claim or assessment available information opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors and the experience gained from similar cases or situations we provide disclosures for material contingencies when management deems there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred we provide estimates of reasonably possible losses when such estimates may be reasonably determined either as a single amount or within a reasonable range 

actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of contingencies see note 15—commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2015 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in a 6 million decrease in our pretax earnings 

in july 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 100 million this agreement effectively converted the interest on 100 million of outstanding 6085 fixed rate debt maturing 2017 to a variable rate of sixmonth libor plus 3422 we entered into this interest rate swap to mitigate interest cost at the parent company relating to debt that was incurred by our prior owners and was not used in any manner to finance the cash needs of our subsidiaries the interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 2 million for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 as the swap interest rates are fixed through 

 

april 2016 a hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rates associated with the interest swap agreement would result in a 1 million decrease on our preta x earnings for the year ended december 31 2015 this calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates 

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the expected ability to recover price increases through rates nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated services provided by our regulated businesses and marketbased businesses our regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while our marketbased businesses engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates in addition pension and other benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields 

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of december 31 2015 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in rule 13a15f of the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and our directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 using the criteria described in internal control—integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

based on our evaluation under the framework in internal control—integrated framework 2013  our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2015 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report appearing in item 8—financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal control over financial reporting

there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

our company 

founded in 1886 american water works company inc the “company” “american water” or “aww” is a delaware holding company american water is the most geographically diversified as well as the largest publiclytraded united states water and wastewater utility company as measured by both operating revenues and population served as a holding company we conduct substantially all of our business operations through our subsidiaries our approximately 6400 employees provide an estimated 15 million people with drinking water wastewater andor other waterrelated services in 47 states and one canadian province

operating segments

we report our results of operations in two operating segments the regulated businesses and the marketbased operations additional information with respect to our operating segment results is included in the section entitled “item 7—management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” and note 18 of the consolidated financial statements 

regulated businesses 

our primary business involves the ownership of subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater utility services to residential commercial industrial and other customers including sale for resale and public authority customers we report the results of this business in our regulated businesses segment our subsidiaries that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state commissions or other entities engaged in economic regulation hereafter referred to as public utility commissions or “pucs” of the states in which we operate the federal and state governments also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our regulated businesses segment operating revenues were 26743 million for 2014 25399 for 2013 25644 million for 2012 accounting for 888 901 and 899 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

the following table sets forth our regulated businesses operating revenues number of customers and an estimate of population served as of december 31 2014   

 









overview of networks facilities and water supply 

our regulated businesses operate in approximately 1600 communities in 16 states in the united states our primary operating assets include 89 dams and 81 surface water treatment plants along with approximately 500 groundwater treatment plants 1000 groundwater wells 100 wastewater treatment facilities 1200 treated water storage facilities 1300 pumping stations and 48000 

 

miles of mains and collection pipes our regulated utilities own substantially all of the assets used by our regulated businesses we generally own the land and physical assets used to store extract and treat source water typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our regulated businesses we have ongoing infrastructure renewal programs in all states in which our regulated businesses operate these programs consist of both rehabilitation of existing mains and other equipment and replacement of mains and other equipment that are damaged or have reached or are near the end of their useful service lives 

as noted our regulated businesses are dependent upon a defined source of water supply and obtain their water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams in addition we also obtain water from ground water sources such as wells and purchase water from other water suppliers the following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our regulated businesses for 2014 by volume 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water we employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of the economic effect associated with weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service territory in any given summer some areas may have source issues and experience drier than average weather while other areas we serve may experience wetter than average weather 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we use planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development 

additionally in california as part of the urban water management plan of 1983 water suppliers serving greater than 3000 acre feet per year or 3000 connections are required to submit an urban water management plan to the department of water resources every five years these plans assess water supply reliability over a 20year planning period under normal dry and multiyear dry periods to ensure that water suppliers have adequate water supply for current and future demands in 2009 additional conservation elements were added to the plan that required utilities to show how they could meet a 20 demand reduction by 2020 

 

the percentage of finished water supply by source type for our top seven states by regulated businesses revenues for 2014 is as follows 

 



 





the level of treatment we apply to the water varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources such as rivers typically require significant treatment while some groundwater sources such as aquifers require chemical treatment only in addition a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water purveyors treated water is transported through our transmission and distribution network which includes underground pipes above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water to the customers’ premises 

we have installed production meters to measure the water that we deliver to our distribution network we also employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption ranging from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices touch read or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards the treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent and the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

economic regulation and rate making process 

the operations of our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective pucs the term “economic regulation” is intended to indicate that these state pucs regulate the economic aspects of service to the public but do not generally establish water quality standards which are typically set by the federal environmental protection agency “epa” andor state environmental authorities state pucs have broad authority to regulate many of the economic and service aspects of the utilities for example state pucs often issue certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations that may be required for a company to provide service in specific areas they also approve the rates and conditions under which service is provided and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs and cost of capital significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions and relationships between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions in many instances regulatory approvals are required to effect the transaction regulatory policies not only vary from state to state but can change over time as well these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the pucs in the states in which we operate and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate case delays or inadequate rate recovery 

economic regulation of utilities involves many competing and occasionally conflicting public interests and policy goals the primary responsibility of pucs is to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and utility investors although the specific approach to economic regulation varies certain general principles are consistent across the states in which our 

 

regulated subsidiaries operate based on certain legal and regulatory principles economic regulation is generally intended to provide a utility the right to serve specific geographic areas in return the utility undertakes the obligation to provide safe and adequate service to all customers within its service area and is authorized an annual revenue requirement intended to provide recovery of prudent operation and maintenance costs depreciation and taxes and an opportunity to earn a fair return on capital investment necessary to provide service to customers 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to a volumetric charge based on consumption and a base fee component set by a tariff approved by the puc the process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally occurs by way of a “rate case” filed by the utility with the puc on a periodic basis the timing of rate case filings may be determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs changes in operating revenues operating costs or other market conditions a puc may also initiate the filing of a rate case to conduct an investigation and may impose other conditions on the content and timing of filings under certain circumstances 

state pucs differ with regard to the types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their ratemaking processes and how they reach their final rate determinations however in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on a number of areas including the cost and prudence of investment in facilities operating and maintenance expenses and taxes the appropriate cost of capital and equity return revenues or consumption at current and expected levels allocation of the revenue requirements among customer classes service quality and issues raised by customers 

failure of the pucs to recognize reasonable and prudent operating and capital costs can result in the inability of the utility to meet its debt service provide adequate service to its customers and earn its authorized return which can impact the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete therefore there may be delays or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating cost increase and when those costs are reflected in rates for instance an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not begin to be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until the effective date of the subsequent rate case our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital recognition of declining consumption and appropriate recovery of utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the management team at each of our regulated businesses anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files rate cases with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective and a reasonable opportunity to earn the authorized return on invested capital or rate base 

our regulated subsidiaries work with legislatures and pucs to mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag through the adoption of positive regulatory policies these policies include for example infrastructure replacement surcharges that allow rates to change outside the context of a general rate proceeding to reflect on a more timely basis investments to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain high quality reliable service currently pennsylvania illinois missouri indiana new york new jersey and tennessee allow the use of infrastructure surcharges forwardlooking test year mechanisms allow us to earn on a more current basis our current or projected usage and costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital some states have permitted the use of a fully forecasted test year instead of historical data to set rates those states are illinois kentucky new york tennessee california pennsylvania indiana hawaii and virginia in all states in which we operate on a regulated basis pucs have allowed utilities to update historical data for certain “known and measurable” changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year this allows utilities to take into account more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process the extent to which historical data can be updated will generally vary from state to state

another mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag is the ability in certain circumstances to recover the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include pennsylvania kentucky virginia illinois and california in addition some states such as indiana allow the utility to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the puc assesses the prudency of such projects

surcharge mechanisms are also available in a number of states to reflect outside of a general rate proceeding changes in major operating expenses which may be beyond the utility’s control for example new jersey california virginia illinois and tennessee have allowed surcharges for purchased water costs california has allowed surcharges for power and certain other costs and new york has allowed annual reconciliations for expenses such as power fuel chemicals and property taxes tennessee has allowed surcharges for power chemical and tennessee river authority inspections fees

certain states have approved consolidated rates or singletariff pricing policies consolidated rates or singletariff pricing is the use of a unified rate structure for multiple water systems that are owned and operated by a single utility but may or may not be contiguous or physically interconnected the singletariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state based on costs that are determined on a statewide or intrastate regional basis thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while 

 

lowering administrative costs for our customers for states that do not employ singletariffs we may have multiple general rate cases filed at any given point in time examples of states that have adopted a full or partial singletariff pricing policy include pennsylvania new jersey missouri west virginia kentucky indiana illinois and iowa therefore of our seven largest states six have some form of singletariff pricing pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater rate structures which results in singletariff pricing among water and wastewater systems 

in some states the puc has implemented mechanisms to enhance utility revenue stability in light of conservation initiatives decreasing per capita consumption or other factors sometimes referred to as “decoupling” these mechanisms to some extent separate recoverable revenues from volumes of water sold for example the state of california has decoupled revenues from water sold to help achieve the state initiative to reduce water usage by 20 by 2020 this progressive regulation enables utilities to encourage water efficiency as revenues are not tied to sales similarly new york has implemented a surcharge or credit based on the difference between actual net revenues and the revenues allowed in the most recent rate order 

california also has a multiyear cost of capital proceeding outside of the general rate case process this proceeding authorizes the utility’s capital structure and authorized rates of return as well as provides an automatic adjustment mechanism that triggers an adjustment to the authorized cost of capital if the moody’s utility bond index changes beyond certain thresholds on an annual basis

we pursue positive regulatory policies as part of our rate and revenue management program to enhance our ability to provide high quality sustainable cost effective service to customers to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments and to ensure positive shortterm liquidity and longterm profitability for a financially stable company which benefits our customers employees and shareholders the ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept our proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these policies will reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes however the company strives to use these and other regulatory policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

customers 

we have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our regulated businesses an active customer is defined as a party with an active agreement to receive a specific service from a connection to our water or wastewater system as of the last business day of each monthly reporting period also as in the case of apartment complexes businesses and many homes multiple individuals may be served by a single contract 

residential customers make up the majority of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate in 2014 residential customers accounted for 910 of the customers 593 of the operating revenues and approximately 504 of the billed water sales of our regulated businesses we also serve commercial customers such as shops and businesses industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we also supply water to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities as well as providing bulk water supplies to other water utilities for distribution to their own customers

the vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption typically on a monthly basis our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption 

in fiscal year 2014 no single regulated businesses customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated annual operating revenues

the following table sets forth the number of water and wastewater customers by customer class for our regulated businesses as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 



 

 

changes in customer growth in our regulated businesses is driven by i organic population growth or contraction in our authorized service areas ii adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water andor wastewater utility systems and iii the sale of water to other community water systems generally we add customers through tuckins of small and medium water andor wastewater systems in close geographic proximity to areas where we operate our regulated businesses which we refer to as “tuckins” we will continue to acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuckins the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies historically pursuing tuckins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate certain markets in the united states where we do not operate our regulated businesses we will also selectively seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing and new markets before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for quality reliability and compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality standards 

seasonality

customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions particularly during the summer our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler andor wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues and operating income summer weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues and operating income however when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies thereby reducing customer usage and operating revenues these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands other factors affecting our customers’ usage of water include conservation initiatives such as the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers declining household sizes in the united states and changes in the economy and credit markets which could have significant impacts on our industrial and commercial customers’ operational and financial performance 

competition 

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct competition in providing services in our existing markets because i we operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a barrier to market entry our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors when pursuing acquisitions based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environnement american states water co and california water services group from time to time we also face competition from infrastructure funds multiutility companies and others such as algonquen power colix and others

supplies 

our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals energy and fuel as well as maintenance material and other critical inputs many of these inputs are subject to shortterm price volatility shortterm price volatility is partially mitigated through existing procurement contracts current supplier continuity plans the regulatory rate setting process and rate mechanisms 

because of our geographic diversity we maintain relationships with many chemical equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace and we do not rely on any single entity for a significant amount of our supplies we also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and longterm cost effectiveness as a result of this process and our strong relationships with suppliers we have historically been able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations 

we typically have a combination of standby power generation or dual electric service feeds at key facilities multiple water production facilities emergency interconnections with adjacent water systems and finished water storage that keep our operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies 

 

condemnation 

the potential exists that all or portions of our regulated subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods 







for example condemnation threats have been made over the last several years with respect to the following systems





the acquisition consideration related to such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter we believe our regulated businesses would be entitled to fair market value for any assets required to be sold and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets for additional information including with respect to ongoing condemnation efforts see “item 1a—risk factors—the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain”

we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses 

marketbased operations 

in addition to our regulated businesses we also provide services to military bases municipalities industrial commercial and residential customers that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs and do not require substantial infrastructure investment through our marketbased operations for 2014 operating revenues for our marketbased operations was 3547 million or 118 of total operating revenues in 2014 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our consolidated annual operating revenues

our marketbased operations include three lines of business 







in november 2014 we disposed of our class b biosolids line of business by selling our subsidiary terratec environmental ltd “terratec” which provided biosolids management transport and disposal services to municipal and industrial customers in ontario canada in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” the results of terratec are presented as discontinued operations and as such have been excluded from continuing operations and operating segment results for all periods presented unless otherwise noted all information in this form 10k is presented on the basis of continuing operations see note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our discontinued operations 

 

military services group

our military services group has eleven 50year contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems on certain military bases all of our contracts with the us government may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to the standard terms of the us government contract termination provisions we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs the contract price for nine of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions two contracts are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called “economic price adjustment” during the contract term we may make limited shortterm capital investments under our contracts with the united states military 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group through our service line protection program provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial establishments to protect against the cost of interior and external water and sewer line repairs and interior electric line repairs our linesaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipalities as of december 31 2014 our homeowner services group has approximately 14 million customer contracts in 43 states and the district of columbia 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including om design build and operate “dbo” and design build finance operate and maintain “dbfom” contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities the food and beverage industry and other customers we are party to approximately 70 contracts varying in size and scope across the united states and canada with contracts ranging in terms from one to 30 years historically we have made little longterm capital investment under these contracts with municipalities and other customers instead we perform our services for a fee occasionally we provide our customers with financing for capital projects as part of a longterm operations and maintenance partnership 

competition 

we face competition in our marketbased operations from a number of service providers including veolia environnement american states water omi and southwest water particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competitive as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as the municipal and industrial fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process 

our homeowner services group faces competition outside our existing footprint primarily from homeserve usa and utility service partners inc 

industry matters

overview 

the united states water and wastewater industry has two main sectors i utility ownership which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers and ii general services which involves providing water and wastewater related services to water and wastewater utilities and other customers on a contract basis 

the utility sector includes investorowned as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions the epa estimates that governmentowned systems account for approximately 84 of all united states community water systems and approximately 98 of all united states community wastewater systems investorowned water and wastewater systems including a small number of private companies and developers account for the remainder of the united states water and wastewater systems growth of service providers in the investorowned regulated utility sector is achieved through organic growth within a franchise area the provision of bulk water service to other community water systems andor acquisitions of entire systems including small and medium water and wastewater systems that are in close geographic proximity to already established regulated operations as well as acquisitions in new service areas 

 

according to the epa the utility segment of the united states water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented with approximately 52000 community water systems and approximately 15000 community wastewater facilities over half of the community water systems are very small serving a population of 500 or less 

this large number of relatively small fragmented water systems as well as fragmented wastewater facilities may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time 

the utility sector is characterized by high barriers to entry given the capital intensive nature of the industry the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in constant need of modernization and replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of water and wastewater residuals’ discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization in 2007 the epa estimated that approximately 390 billion of capital spending would be necessary over the then next 20 years to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states the epa estimated that the nation’s drinking water utilities need 384 billion in infrastructure investments for thousands of miles of pipe as well as thousands of treatment plants storage tanks and other key assets between 2011 and 2030 to ensure the public health security and economic wellbeing of our cities towns and communities additionally in 2013 the american society of civil engineers’ “asce” report card for america’s infrastructure gave the water and wastewater infrastructure a grade of “d” due to the fact that much of the infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life the report concluded that there will be an investment gap between now and 2020 of 84 billion for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure

the following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2011 through 2030 for united states water systems

for 2015 to 2019 we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will amount to approximately 60 billion of the 60 billion 52 billion is anticipated to be utilized to upgrade our infrastructure and systems in addition to these capital expenditures we are also estimating additional capital investment over the fiveyear period of approximately 08 billion for acquisitions and for strategic capital strategic investments could include opportunities in the unregulated shale arena or investments related to the waterenergy nexus andor concession agreements or acquisitions our total capital plan for 2015 is estimated to be approximately 12 billion with approximately 11 billion allocated to upgrading our infrastructure and systems including infrastructure renewal programs and construction of facilities to meet environmental requirements and new customer growth the remaining 01 billion is expected to be spent for acquisitions and strategic investment purposes the charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures over the period of 2015 to 2019 for upgrading our infrastructure and systems by asset type and purpose of investment respectively 

 

 

water and wastewater rates 

water and wastewater rates in the united states are among the lowest for developed countries and for most us consumers water and wastewater bills make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services the following chart sets forth the relative cost of water and other public services including trash and garbage collection and sewer maintenance in the united states as a percentage of total household utility expenditures

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations including the services provided under both our regulated businesses and marketbased operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater we 

 

are also subject to certain regulations regarding fire protection services in the areas we serve these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we also are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently the overall trend has been that they have become more stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could increase we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our regulated businesses are subject in the past we have generally been able to recover costs associated with compliance related to environmental health and safety standards but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery 

we maintain an appropriate environmental policy including responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural resources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples from across our water systems are analyzed on a regular basis for compliance with regulatory requirements across the company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2014 we achieved a score of greater than 99 for drinking water compliance and according to the epa statistics american water’s performance has been far better than the industry average over the last several years in fact in 2014 american water was 20 times better than the industry average for compliance with drinking water quality standards maximum contaminant levels and 150 times better for compliance with drinking water monitoring and reporting requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 68 of our 81 surface water plants receiving the program’s “director” award which recognizes utilities that have completed a comprehensive self assessment report created an action plan for continuous improvement and produces high quality drinking water we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 63 american water plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award while 59 have been awarded the “tenyear phase iii” award additionally three plants received the inaugural “fifteenyear phase iii” award which recognizes plants that have met the director award status for 15 years 

safe drinking water act 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns to date the epa has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water further certain of our water systems are in the process of monitoring for 28 additional contaminants that are not currently regulated to help the epa determine if any of them occur at high enough levels to warrant being regulated there are thousands of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources the epa also revised the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule in 2007 and congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act on january 4 2011 regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings or fixtures solder and flux in 2012 the epa finalized revisions to the total coliform rule that were part of the mandate of a federal advisory committee appointed to negotiate the changes most of the anticipated changes to the rule will not be effective until 2016 the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including strontium hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds but we do not anticipate that any of these regulations will require implementation in 2015 on july 1 2014 the state of california implemented a standard making the primary drinking water standard 10 ugl for hexavalent chromium we are in compliance with this new standard

 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act pursuant to the npdes program the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals which generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the united states occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see “business—research and development” 

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters these proceedings are described further in the section entitled “item 3—legal proceedings” 

research and development 

we established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our business our research and development personnel are located in new jersey in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports research through testing and analysis 

since the formation of the epa in 1970 we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa has helped us to achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

approximately onequarter of our research budget is funded by competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers in 2014 we spent 36 million including 08 million funded by research grants spending net of research grant funding amounted to 29 million and 28 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical for providing quality and reliable service at reasonable rates and maintaining our leadership position in the industry which provides us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

support services 

our american water works service company subsidiary provides shared services and corporate governance for our operating subsidiaries that gain economies of scale through central administration these services are provided predominantly to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services which are provided at cost may include accounting administration business development communications corporate administrative education and training engineering financial health and safety human resources information systems internal audit investor relations legal operations procurement rates support security risk management water quality and research and 

 

development these arrangements afford our operating companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis we also operate two national customer service centers which are located in alton illinois and pensacola florida that provide customer relations operations and field service support 

our security department provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing implementing monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required vulnerability assessments are conducted periodically to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs we are in contact with federal state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply 

employee matters 

approximately 50 of our workforce is represented by unions we have 75 collective bargaining agreements in place with 17 different unions representing our unionized employees we have two union contracts beyond expiration that affect approximately 50 employees all of which are actively working under the old agreements during 2015 24 of our local union contracts will expire 

on october 13 2014 we entered into a settlement agreement with the utility workers union of america “uwua” designed to resolve a dispute between our company and the labor unions representing employees in the regulated businesses “the unions” among other things the settlement agreement provides for a new 20142018 national benefits agreement that will be in effect generally until july 31 2018 in addition we agreed to make a 100 million lumpsum payment to be distributed in accordance with procedures set forth in the settlement agreement among eligible employees represented by the unions and affected by implementation of our last best and final offer the majority of the distributions are expected to be used to reimburse employees for medical claims which were incurred during the relevant period and will be funded by the group insurance plan for american water works company inc and its designated subsidiaries and affiliates – active employees veba the “veba trust” to which we previously have made contributions 

the unions approved the settlement agreement on october 30 2014 and the national labor relations board the “nlrb” approved the settlement agreement on october 31 2014 the nlrb uwua and the company filed a joint stipulation to dismiss the petition for review the seventh circuit voluntarily dismissed all the parties appeals on december 16 2014 the nlrb will dismiss the unfair labor practice charge pending on the national benefits dispute when we have complied with the settlement agreement

risk factors 

tableend

we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered 

 

in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation decisions by state pucs and other regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are economically regulated by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses including but not limited to operating and maintenance costs depreciation financing costs and taxes and provide us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly our rate increase requests may not be approved and any approval may not be given in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to cover our expenses including purchased water and costs of chemicals fuel and other commodities used in our operations enable us to recover our investment and provide us with an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if certain conditions exist including but not limited to if water usage is less than anticipated in establishing rates as billings to customers are to a considerable extent based on usage in addition to a base rate or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than was estimated in establishing rates

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations compliance with increasingly stringent laws and regulations could impact our operating costs and violations of such laws and regulations could subject us to substantial liabilities and costs

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include the clean water act of 1972 which we refer to as the clean water act and the safe drinking water act of 1974 which we refer to as the safe drinking water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations 

in addition state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could reduce requested rate increases or force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases that would enable us to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future

 

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 20 2009 cease and desist order of the california state water resources control board the “2009 order” that our subsidiary californiaamerican water company “cal am” significantly decrease its diversions from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule running through december 31 2016 the 2016 deadline we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act we cannot predict whether cal am will be able to secure alternative sources of water or if cal am will be exposed to liabilities if it is unable to meet the 2016 deadline under the 2009 order if cal am or any of our other subsidiaries are unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this report that includes additional information regarding the cal am matter

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters may disrupt our operations and economic conditions may reduce the demand for water services either of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas these include winter storms and freezing conditions high wind conditions hurricanes tornados earthquakes landslides coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains and severe electrical storms weather events such as these may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage in october 2012 our east coast subsidiaries were affected by hurricane sandy the most significant impact to our business was caused by the widespread power outages caused by the storm’s heavy winds rain and snow in addition adverse economic conditions can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas if a regional drought were to occur governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system for example as a result of the reduced rain fall and overall dry conditions throughout the state of california cal am has been closely monitoring its owned and purchased water supplies on january 17 2014 the governor of california issued a drought declaration asking californians to reduce their water use by 20 on april 25 2014 the governor issued an executive order addressing the drought and on july 15 2014 the state water resources control board approved mandatory statewide water restrictions the cpuc issued a resolution requiring cal am and all other regulated water providers to abide by the state water resources control board restrictions and requirements while expenses incurred in implementing water conservation and rationing plans in cal am’s districts are generally recoverable provided the cpuc determines they were reasonable cal am cannot assure that such expenses will in fact be fully recovered moreover reductions in water consumption including those resulting from installation of equipment or changed consumer behavior may persist even after drought restrictions are repealed and the drought has ended which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

some scientific experts are predicting a worsening of weather volatility in the future changing severe weather patterns could require additional expenditures to reduce the risk associated with any increasing storm flood and drought occurrences the issue of climate change is receiving increased attention worldwide many climate change predictions if true present several potential challenges to water and wastewater utilities such as increased frequency and duration of droughts increased precipitation and flooding potential degradation of water quality and changes in demand for services because of the uncertainty of weather volatility related to climate change we cannot predict its potential impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection treatment or disposal systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition moreover if we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow or disposal operations our losses might not be covered by insurance and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

the current regulatory rate setting structure may result in a significant delay or “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can address these events through the rate case application process our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business

there is typically a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience a regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

we endeavor to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing positive regulatory policies for example seven state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond our control such as purchased water costs or property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under the rate case application process while these programs have been a positive development and we continue to seek expansion of programs to mitigate regulatory lag some state pucs have not approved such programs the puc may not adopt any surcharge programs and existing programs may not continue in their current form or at all furthermore no state has adopted surcharge programs that include all elements of cost that may change between general rate proceedings although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2014 we invested 10 billion in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems could increase in the future we fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt and equity securities we may not be able to access the debt and equity capital markets when necessary or desirable to fund capital improvements on favorable terms or at all

in addition we could be limited in our ability to both pursue growth and pay dividends in accordance with our dividend policy in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we expect that we will need additional financing we expect cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital expenditures

the ability to obtain financing at reasonable rates is contingent upon our credit ratings and general market conditions if we do not obtain sufficient financing we could be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment fund our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and expand our rate base to enable us to earn satisfactory future returns on our investments even with adequate financial resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital projects on time as a result of construction delays permitting delays environmental restrictions or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

 

weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our water service and our revenues

demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to increased water usage for irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other applications throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months demand tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues

market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans the value of these assets is subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans additionally our pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase our funding requirements future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates in which case our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs

as of december 31 2014 our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 6 billion and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including















in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new debt securities moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2015 2016 and 2017 are 611 million 534 million and 5728 million respectively we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all moreover if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms

we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative regulatory and other factors largely beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be 

 

unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely

contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and exposure to substances not typically found in potable water supplies and subject our subsidiaries to reduction in usage governmental enforcement actions private litigation and responsive obligations

the water supplies that flow into our treatment plants and are then delivered into our distribution system are subject to contamination including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether and possible terrorist attacks if one of our water supplies is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to take responsive actions that could include 1 continuing limited use of the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that enables continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection or 2 interrupting the use of that water supply and locating an adequate supply of water from another water source including in some cases through the purchase of water from a thirdparty supplier if service is disrupted and we are unable to access a substitute water supply in a costeffective manner our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods we might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates or recovery of these costs may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be subject to claims for damages arising from government enforcement actions or toxic tort or other lawsuits arising out of interruption of service or human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 

in this regard on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances used for processing coal into the elk river near the wvawc treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia 

wvawc has and may continue to incur significant costs in responding to this incident and may not be able to recover such costs through rates or from insurers even if recovery is possible it may not occur in a timely manner government investigations relating to the freedom industries spill have been initiated state laws have been enacted state and federal legislatures are considering changes to existing laws or rules associated with new laws and 58 lawsuits have been filed to date against wvawc and in a few cases against us or another of our affiliates while the company and wvawc believe that wvawc has responded appropriately to and has no responsibility for the freedom industries spill and the company and wvawc believe they and other company affiliates have valid meritorious defenses to the lawsuits wvawc will incur defense costs that may not be recoverable moreover an adverse outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation wvawc and the company are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing government investigations or any legislative initiatives that might affect water utility operations see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” in this report for additional information regarding the wvawc matter

in addition we are a party to litigation in the normal course of business since we engage in providing drinking water to our customers failures can result in substantial injury or damage to our customers employees or others and we could be exposed to substantial claims and litigation such claims could relate to among other things personal injury loss of life business interruption property damage pollution and environmental damage and may be brought by our customers or third parties 

litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings can and do occur pending or future claims against us to the extent we are not insured against a loss or our insurer fails to provide coverage could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

we may sustain losses that exceed or are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured

we maintain insurance coverage as part of our overall legal and risk management strategy to minimize our potential liabilities our insurance programs have varying coverage limits exclusions and maximums and insurance companies may seek to deny claims we might make generally our insurance policies cover property damage worker’s compensation employer’s liability general liability and automobile liability each policy includes deductibles or selfinsured retentions and policy limits for covered claims as a result we may sustain losses that exceed or that are excluded from our insurance coverage or for which we are not insured

although in the past we have been generally able to cover our insurance needs there can be no assurances that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance in the future or that such insurance can be economically secured for example catastrophic events can result in decreased coverage limits more limited coverage increased premium costs or deductibles 

 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations

approximately 50 of our workforce is represented by unions we have 75 collective bargaining agreements in place with 17 different unions representing our unionized employees we might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are fair to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur a strike or work stoppage may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

we own 89 dams a failure of any of those dams could result in personal injury and downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs or upgrades can be and has been material the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams which also could entail material costs although in most cases the puc has permitted recovery of expenses and capital investment related to dam rehabilitation we might not be able to recover costs of repairs upgrades or dismantling through rates in the future the inability to recover these costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments

our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

in addition to cash from operations we rely on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external source of liquidity is our revolving credit facility we regularly use our commercial paper program as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we obtain in the commercial paper market however disruptions in the capital markets could limit our ability to access capital while our credit facility lending banks have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs particularly if borrowings through the commercial paper market are unavailable we maintain a 125 billion revolving credit facility under the terms of our revolving credit facility commitments of 70 million mature in october 2017 and 118 billion mature in october 2018 our inability to maintain renew or replace these commitments could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and 365 million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility as of february 19 2015 awcc had 5029 million of outstanding commercial paper as of february 19 2015 our lenders may not meet their existing commitments and we may not be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all

 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital and credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures

any impediments to our access to the capital markets or failure of our lenders to meet their commitments that result from financial market disruptions could expose us to increased interest expense require us to institute cash conservation measures or otherwise adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business and results of operations

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process could have the following consequences among others























any of the foregoing consequences could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems any further acquisitions we undertake may involve risks further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and strategic and financial buyers may hinder our ability to grow our business

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and strategic and financial buyers may hinder our ability to expand our business 

 

the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses with our existing operations could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in





















some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to finance our business pay dividends and to comply with regulatory requirements the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve anticipated sales and profitability and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to expand through acquisitions in addition our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities adjacent to or near our existing service areas thereby impairing our ability to geographically expand the affected service areas competing governmental entities utilities environmental or social activist groups and strategic and financial buyers have challenged and may in the future challenge our efforts to acquire new companies andor service areas our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new companies andor service areas with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations any of these risks may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations

our total assets include 12 billion of goodwill at december 31 2014 the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 and the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and other intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities market price performance of our common stock that composes unfavorably to our peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the results forecasted in our business plan due to events such as changes in rate case results capital investment budgets or our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our 

 

regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain should a municipality or other government subdivision or a citizen group seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain either directly or indirectly as a result of a citizen petition we may resist the acquisition for example condemnation threats have been made in the chicago illinois area where the municipalities of homer glen approximately 6000 customer connections and bolingbrook approximately 23000 customer connections have commissioned studies to determine the cost and feasibility of condemning illinoisamerican’s retail distribution systems serving those communities and have formally requested certain financial and other information from illinoisamerican in addition five municipalities approximately 29200 customer connections formed a water agency to pursue eminent domain with respect to our water pipeline that serves those five communities and made an offer of 376 million for the pipeline the water agency filed an eminent domain lawsuit in january 2013 that is still pending

contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain or responding to a citizen petition may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated businesses’ management from the operation of its business moreover our efforts to resist the condemnation may not be successful

if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges

for information regarding specific condemnation threats made against us that were recently concluded see item 1 “business—condemnation”

we rely on technology to facilitate the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business

our technology systems particularly our information technology “it” systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations for example we depend on our it systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections our it systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers while we recently completed the business transformation implementation for our enterprise resource planning “erp” enterprise asset management “eam” and customer information “cis” systems a number of our mission and business critical it systems are older such as our scada supervisory control and data acquisition system although we do not believe that our it systems are at a materially greater risk of cybersecurity incidents than other similar organizations our it systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from













these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and other adverse consequences in addition the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us

in addition we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of outdated existing technology to enable us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency

we may be subject to physical andor cyber attacks

as operators of critical infrastructure we may face a heightened risk of physical andor cyber attacks our water and wastewater systems may be vulnerable to disability or failures as a result of physical or cyber acts of war or terrorism vandalism or other causes our corporate and information technology systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access due to hacking viruses acts of war or terrorism and other causes 

 

if despite our security measures a significant physical attack or cyber breach occurred we could have our operations disrupted property damaged and customer information stolen experience substantial loss of revenues response costs and other financial loss and be subject to increased regulation litigation and damage to our reputation any of which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards

as of december 31 2014 we had us federal and state net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 10 billion and 542 million respectively our federal nol carryforwards begin to expire in 2028 and our state nol carryforwards will expire between 2015 and 2033 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income moreover because our previous owner’s divestiture of its stock was considered an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code the amount of nol carryforwards that may be utilized in any year is limited our management believes the federal nol carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and therefore currently require no valuation allowance at december 31 2014 631 million of the state nol carryforwards have been offset by a valuation allowance because we do not believe these nols will more likely than not be realized in the future and we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our nols the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover changes in income tax laws the economy and the general business environment could affect the future utilization of the nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected

we excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees with respect to certain obligations of our marketbased operations including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients which may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased operations do not satisfy these obligations

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased operations including financial guarantees or deposits in the event our marketbased operations fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected

at december 31 2014 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 8658 million and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased operations expand the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms

our marketbased operations’ longterm contracts with the department of defense may be terminated for the convenience of the us government and are subject to periodic contract price redetermination

all of our contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our results of operations

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to provide capital to properly maintain those systems which may negatively affect us as the operators of the systems

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner of the system to undertake capital improvements in some cases we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner 

 

our marketbased operations are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received

some of our marketbased operations enter into longterm contracts under which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes specified major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee our marketbased operations are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity

our inability to efficiently optimize and stabilize our recently implemented business transformation project could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability

over the past several years we have implemented a “business transformation” project which is intended to improve our business processes and upgrade our legacy core information technology systems this multiyear enterprisewide initiative supports our broader strategic initiatives the project is intended to optimize workflow throughout our field operations improve our backoffice operations and enhance our customer service capabilities the scale and costs associated with the business transformation project were significant any technical or other difficulties in optimizing and stabilizing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting in august 2012 our new business systems associated with phase i of our business transformation project became operational phase i consisted of the rollout of the erp which encompassed applications that handle human resources finance and supply chainprocurement management activities in the second quarter of 2013 we implemented phase ii of our business transformation project in a number of our regulated subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2013 phase ii of our business transformation project was implemented in our remaining regulated subsidiaries phase ii consisted of the rollout of a new enterprise asset management system which manages an asset’s lifecycle and a customer information system which contains all billing and collections data pertaining to american water’s customers for our regulated segment although efforts have been made to minimize any adverse impact on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated

as we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project

we operate numerous information technology systems that are in various stages of integration sometimes leading to inefficiencies therefore delays in stabilization and optimization of the business transformation project will also delay cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the project we may also experience difficulties consolidating our current systems moving to a common set of operational processes and implementing a successful change management process these difficulties may impact our ability to meet customer needs efficiently any such delays or difficulties may have a material and adverse impact on our business client relationships and financial results

our business has inherently dangerous workplaces if we fail to maintain safe work sites we can be exposed to financial losses as well as penalties and other liabilities

our safety record is critical to our reputation we maintain health and safety standards to protect our employees customers vendors and the public although we intend to adhere to such health and safety standards it is unlikely that we will be able to avoid accidents at all times 

our business sites including construction and maintenance sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with large pieces of equipment moving vehicles pressurized water chemicals and other regulated materials on many sites we are responsible for safety and accordingly must implement safety procedures if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective or are not followed by our employees or others our employees and others may be injured or die unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover and raise our operating costs any of the foregoing could result in financial losses which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

in addition our operations can involve the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals which if improperly handled stored or disposed of could subject us to penalties or other liabilities we are also subject to regulations dealing with occupational health and safety although we maintain functional employee groups whose primary purpose is to ensure we implement effective health safety and environmental work procedures throughout our organization including construction sites and maintenance sites the failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to liability

 

our continued success is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel

the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to hire retain and utilize qualified personnel including engineers craft personnel and corporate management professionals who have the required experience and expertise from time to time it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals with the expertise and in the timeframe demanded for our business needs in certain geographic areas for example we may not be able to satisfy the demand for our services because of our inability to successfully hire and retain qualified personnel

in addition as some of our key personnel approach retirement age we need to have appropriate succession plans in place and to successfully implement such plans if we cannot attract and retain qualified personnel or effectively implement appropriate succession plans it could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations

alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

in 1995 the california water resources control board the water resources control board issued an administrative order the “1995 order” to cal am requiring cal am to implement an alternative water supply in lieu of diversions from the carmel river in response to claims that cal am had not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by the 1995 order the water resources control board adopted the 2009 order finding that cal am has not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river as required by the 1995 order the 2009 order requires among other things that cal am significantly decrease its yearly diversions from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule running from the date the 2009 order was adopted until december 31 2016 at which point all unpermitted diversions must end failure to effect the decrease in diversions mandated by the 2009 order could result in substantial penalties we can provide no assurances that cal am will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to us as noted below cal am does not expect to have sufficient alternative sources of water available by the december 31 2016 deadline and is engaged in discussions with the water resources control board to extend the deadline

 

on december 2 2010 the california public utilities commission “cpuc” approved the regional desalination project the “rdp” involving the construction of a desalination facility in the city of marina north of monterey the rdp was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cal am the desalination facility was to be constructed and owned by mcwd and mcwra was to construct the wells that were to supply water to the desalination facility the rdp was intended among other things to fulfill cal am’s obligations under the 1995 order and the 2009 order in addition to other obligations 

the rdp was subject to delay due to among other things funding delays and investigations and inquiries initiated by public authorities relating to an alleged conflict of interest concerning a former member of the mcwra board of directors the “former director” on july 7 2011 mcwra advised mcwd and cal am that the agreements were void as a result of the conduct of the former director subsequently on august 12 2011 cal am advised mcwd and mcwra that they had defaulted in performance of certain financing obligations under the water purchase agreement by letter delivered to mcwd and mcwra on september 28 2011 cal am terminated the agreements as a result of mcwra’s anticipatory repudiation of the agreements by stating they were void on january 17 2012 following unsuccessful mediation efforts among the parties cal am publicly announced that it had withdrawn support of the rdp disputes among the parties with respect to the rdp continued thereafter on july 12 2012 the cpuc closed the proceedings relating to the rdp and stated that it would examine the recoverability of costs related to the rdp in other proceedings cal am plans to file a new application seeking recovery of legal costs relating to the rdp after any pending legal disputes are resolved 

in december 2012 cal am mcwra and the county of monterey entered into a settlement agreement under which cal am will forgive approximately 19 million previously loaned by cal am to mcwra in connection with the rdp and cal am will make additional payments of up to approximately 15 million to mcwra the settlement agreement the debt forgiveness and the additional payments are conditioned on cpuc approval including approval of cal am rate recovery of the debt forgiveness and the additional payments cal am and mcwd also entered into a tolling agreement which as extended by subsequent agreements toll applicable statutes of limitations and the deadline for commencement of litigation regarding cal am’s claims until june 30 2015 the mcwra settlement agreement and the tolling and standstill agreement do not affect litigation initiated by cal am seeking a determination regarding the validity of the agreements which is described below on may 24 2013 cal am filed an application with the cpuc for approval of the settlement agreement and rate recovery on cal am’s debt forgiveness and additional payments to mcwra under the settlement agreement the application is pending 

on october 4 2012 cal am filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the monterey county superior court subsequently transferred to the san francisco superior court against mcwra and mcwd seeking a determination by the court as to whether the agreements are void as a result of the former director’s alleged conflict of interest or remained valid a trial on the matter was held on december 25 2014 the court has established deadlines for posttrial closing and reply briefs but has not yet scheduled a date for oral argument following the february 10 2015 deadline for submission of reply briefs 

on april 23 2012 cal am filed an application with the cpuc for approval of the monterey peninsula water supply project the “water supply project” the water supply project involves construction of a desalination plant and related facilities all to be owned by cal am in addition the water supply project may encompass cal am’s purchase of water from the proposed monterey peninsula groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” a joint project between the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the monterey peninsula water management district “mpwmd” the water supply project also would involve aquifer storage and recovery through an already established aquifer storage and recovery program between cal am and the mpwmd 

on july 31 2013 cal am entered into a settlement agreement with 15 other parties that have intervened in the cpuc proceedings with respect to the water supply project including several monterey county government entities the office of ratepayer advocates of the cpuc and several interest groups the “wsp settlement” under the settlement agreement the parties have agreed on several matters relating to the water supply project in a separate settlement agreement among most of the same parties the participating parties agreed on sizing of the desalination plant at 96 million gallons per day if the gwr project does not supply water to cal am and if the gwr project supplies water to cal am either 64 million gallons per day or 69 million gallons per day depending on discrete capacities of gwr project water this settlement agreement is subject to the approval of the cpuc and will not take effect unless the cpuc determines that it is reasonable within the law and the public interest and until the cpuc certifies an environmental impact report for the proposed water supply project which currently is expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2016 

a preliminary step to building the desalination plant is the test slant well project involving the construction and operation of a test slant well as well as monitoring well clusters and other related infrastructure to confirm the suitability of the property on which permanent intake wells will be located to draw water from under monterey bay as proposed by cal am the site of the test slant well is on a property owned by one or more affiliates of cemex inc collectively cemex and in the wsp settlement the parties agreed that the preferred location to build a test slant well project is the cemex property cal am and cemex have entered into an agreement 

 

under which cal am acquired a temporary investigative easement to construct and operate the test slant well together with monitoring wells and other related infrastructure on cemex property and a four year option to purchase a permanent easement that will enable cal ams access to and operation of slant wells and related pipelines and utilities for the water supply project on portions of the cemex property to be determined if and when the final configuration of new water supply wells are approved by the california coastal commission “coastal commission” 

on november 12 2014 the coastal commission approved the coastal development permit for the test slant well on the cemex property in addition the coastal commission approved a second coastal development permit enabling cal am to construct the portion of the test slant well that will be under state lands beneath the ocean floor provided that cal am acquires a lease from the california state lands commission the “state lands commission” which owns the state lands the state lands commission executed the required lease on january 22 2015 and the coastal commission issued the second coastal development permit on january 28 2015 

on december 11 2014 mcwd filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the monterey county superior court against the coastal commission and cal am with the consent of all parties involved the matter was transferred to the san jose county superior court mcwd seeks among other things a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the coastal commission to vacate its decision to approve the coastal development permit relating to the cemex property and a permanent injunction restraining cal am and the coastal commission from taking any action to implement the test slant well project pending full compliance with the california environmental quality act “ceqa” and the california coastal act the “coastal act” 

on december 23 2014 ag land trust an agricultural land conservancy filed its first amended petition for writ of mandamus with the san jose county superior court against the coastal commission and cal am the ag land trust petition the ag land trust petition seeks writs of mandate ordering the coastal commission to set aside its approval of the test slant well project and follow california regulations and statutes in complying with ceqa and the coastal act and enjoining cal am from engaging in any activity pursuant to the test slant well project until the project and the coastal commission comply with california regulations and statutes 

on january 15 2015 mcwd filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief in the santa cruz county against the california state lands commission and cal am the january 2015 petition the january 2015 petition seeks injunctive relief restraining the state lands commission and cal am from taking any action to further implement the test slant well project pending full compliance with ceqa and other applicable laws a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the state lands commission to vacate and set aside the decision to approve the lease allowing cal am to construct and operate a test slant well and associated monitoring wells on sovereign lands and a peremptory writ of mandate directing the state lands commission and cal am to comply with the requirements of ceqa and other applicable laws

the coastal commission and the state lands commission have not yet responded to the action or actions in which they respectively are a respondent cal am has not yet responded to the actions although it intends to contest these actions vigorously 

in addition to the foregoing matters cal am’s ability to move forward on the water supply project is subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc review by other government agencies of necessary permit applications and intervention from other parties including some that are not participants in the settlement agreements relating to the water supply project in addition there have been delays in the initial timetable for preparation of the environmental impact report due to among other things uncertainties regarding timing of government approval of various required permits as a result cal am estimates that the earliest date by which the water supply project could be completed is early 2019 we cannot assure that cal am’s application for the water supply project will be approved or that the water supply project will be completed on a timely basis if ever 

because the projected completion date of the water supply project is beyond the december 31 2016 deadline for cal am to terminate unpermitted diversions from the carmel river cal am has commenced discussions with the water resources control board to extend the december 2016 deadline while cal am believes the discussions have been constructive we cannot assure that the deadline will be extended 

west virginia elk river freedom industries’ chemical spill 

on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances used for processing coal 4methylcyclohexane methanol or mchm and pphdipph a mix of polyglycol ethers into the elk river near the west virginiaamerican water company “wvawc” treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia after having been alerted to the leak of mchm by the west virginia department of environmental protection “dep” wvawc took immediate steps to gather more information about mchm augment its treatment process as a precaution and begin consultations with federal state and local public health officials as soon as possible after it was determined that the augmented treatment process would not fully remove the mchm a joint decision was reached in consultation with the west virginia bureau for public health to issue a “do not use” order for all of 

 

its approximately 93000 customer accounts in parts of nine west virginia counties served by the charleston treatment plant the order addressed the use of water for drinking cooking washing and bathing but did not affect continued use of water for sanitation and fire protection over the next several days wvawc and an interagency team of state and federal officials engaged in extensive sampling and testing to determine if levels of mchm were below one part per million 1 ppm a level that the us centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and epa indicated would be protective of public health beginning on january 13 2014 based on the results of the continued testing the do not use order was lifted in stages to help ensure the water system was not overwhelmed by excessive demand which could have caused additional water quality and service issues by january 18 2014 none of wvawc’s customers were subject to the do not use order although cdc guidance suggesting that pregnant women avoid consuming the water until the chemicals were at nondetectable levels remained in place in addition based on saved samples taken on or before january 18 2014 pphdipph was no longer detected in the water supply as of january 18 2014 on february 21 2014 wvawc announced that all points of testing throughout its water distribution system indicated that levels of mchm were below 10 parts per billion 10 ppb the interagency team established 10 ppb as the “nondetect” level of mchm in the water distribution system based on the measurement capabilities of the multiple laboratories used wvawc continued to work with laboratories to test down to below 2 ppb of mchm and announced on march 3 2014 that it had cleared the system to below this level

to date 58 lawsuits have been filed against wvawc with respect to this matter in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia or west virginia circuit courts in kanawha boone and putnam counties fiftytwo of the state court cases naming wvawc and one case naming both wvawc and american water works service company inc “awwsc” and together with wvawc and the company the “american water defendants” were removed to the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia but are subject to motions to remand the cases back to the state courts and have been consolidated for the sole purpose of resolving venue issues four of the cases pending before the federal district court were consolidated for purposes of discovery and an amended consolidated complaint for those cases was filed on december 9 2014 by several plaintiffs who allegedly suffered economic losses loss of use of property and tap water or other specified adverse consequences as a result of the freedom industries spill on behalf of a purported class of all persons and businesses supplied with using or exposed to water contaminated with crude mchm and provided by wvawc in logan clay lincoln roane jackson boone putnam and kanawha counties and the culloden area of cabell county west virginia as of january 9 2014 the consolidated complaint names several individuals and corporate entities as defendants including the american water defendants the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages for alleged business or economic losses unspecified damages or a mechanism for recovery to address a variety or alleged costs loss of use of property personal injury and other consequences allegedly suffered by purported class members punitive damages and certain additional relief including the establishment of a medical monitoring program to protect the purported class members from an alleged increased risk of contracting serious latent disease the american water defendants have each filed an answer to the consolidated complaint the company individually and awwsc and wvawc together filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint briefing on these motions was completed on january 28 2015 

additionally investigations with respect to the matter have been initiated by the chemical safety board the us attorney’s office for the southern district of west virginia the west virginia attorney general and the public service commission of west virginia the “psc” as a result of the us attorney’s office investigation on december 17 2014 four former freedom industries officers three of whom also were former owners of freedom industries were indicted for among other things negligent discharge of a pollutant in violation of the federal clean water act these executives are also facing additional federal charges resulting from a 13count superseding indictment issued by a grand jury on january 21 2015 in addition information charges were filed against freedom industries for among other things negligent discharge of a pollutant in violation of the clean water act and against the former plant manager of freedom industries elk river facility and one of the individuals responsible for environmental compliance at freedom industries for violating the clean water act 

on may 21 2014 the psc issued an order initiating a general investigation into certain matters relating to wvawcs response to the freedom industries spill three parties have intervened in the proceeding including the consumer advocate division of the psc and two attorneysponsored groups including one sponsored by some of the plaintiffs’ counsel involved in the civil litigation described above wvawc has filed testimony regarding its response to the spill and is subject to discovery from psc staff and the intervenors as part of the general investigation several disputes have arisen between the wvawc and the intervenors regarding among other things the scope of the discovery and the maintenance of confidentiality with regard to certain wvawc emergency planning documents in addition the intervenors and psc staff filed expert testimony in support of their assertions that wvawc did not act reasonably with respect to the freedom industries spill and wvawc has asserted that some of the testimony is outside the scope of the psc proceeding the psc has deferred setting a revised procedural schedule and has not set a final hearing date on the matter 

the company wvawc and the other companyaffiliated entities named in any of the lawsuits believe that wvawc has responded appropriately to and has no responsibility for the freedom industries spill and the company wvawc and other companyaffiliated entities named in any of the lawsuits have valid meritorious defenses to the lawsuits the company wvawc and the other company affiliated entities intend to vigorously contest the lawsuits nevertheless an adverse outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity 

 

and reputation moreover wvawc and the company are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing government investigations or any legislative initiatives that might affect water utility operations 

general

periodically the company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations however litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance it is possible that some litigation and other proceedings could be decided unfavorably to us and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

executive overview 

general 

american water works company inc herein referred to as “american water” or the “company” is the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company as measured both by operating revenues and population served our approximately 6400 employees provide drinking water wastewater and other water related services to an estimated 15 million people 

 

in 47 states and in one canadian province our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial and other customers our regulated businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by state regulatory agencies in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters our regulated businesses provide services in 16 states and serve approximately 32 million customers based on the number of active service connections to our water and wastewater networks we report the results of these businesses in our regulated businesses segment we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state regulatory agencies we report the results of these businesses in our marketbased operations segment 

in 2014 we continued the execution of our strategic goals our commitment to growth through investment in our regulated infrastructure and expansion of our regulated customer base and our marketbased operations combined with operational excellence led to continued improvement in regulated operating efficiency improved performance of our marketbased operations and enabled us to provide increased value to our customers and investors during the year we focused on growth addressed regulatory lag made more efficient use of capital and improved our regulated operation and maintenance “om” efficiency ratio 

2014 financial results 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we continued to increase net income while making significant capital investment in our infrastructure and implementing operational efficiency improvements to keep customer rates affordable highlights of our 2014 operating results compared to 2013 and 2012 include

 



continuing operations

income from continuing operations included 4 cents per diluted share of costs resulting from the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia in 2014 and included 14 cents per diluted share in 2013 related to a tender offer earnings from continuing operations adjusted for these two items increased 10 or 22 cents per share mainly due to favorable operating results from our regulated businesses segment due to higher revenues and lower operating expenses partially offset by higher depreciation expenses also contributing to the overall increase in income from continuing operations was lower interest expense in 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 

discontinued operations

in the fourth quarter of 2014 we sold our terratec line of business which was part of our marketbased operations segment the loss from discontinued operations net of tax reflected in the 2014 financial results includes the loss on the sale an income tax valuation allowance and the 2014 operating results of the entity prior to the sale 

also as part of our portfolio optimization initiative the sales of our regulated subsidiaries in arizona new mexico and ohio were completed during 2012 discontinued operations include the gainloss on sale as well as the operating results of these subsidiaries 

see “consolidated results of operations and variances” and “segment results” below for further detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations as well as our business segments all financial information in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “mda” reflects continuing operations unless otherwise noted see note 3 to consolidated financial statements for further details on our discontinued operations 

making efficient use of capital 

we invested approximately 1 billion and 950 million in companyfunded capital improvements in 2014 and 2013 respectively these capital investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations renew aging treatment and network assets provide capacity for new growth and ensure system reliability security and quality of service the need for continuous investment presents a challenge as we work to balance investment needs with customer affordability in addition the potential for regulatory lag or the delay in recovering operating expenses may impact the level of our capital investments 

 

expanding markets and developing new offerings 

during 2014 our regulated businesses completed the purchase of five regulated water systems five regulated wastewater systems and three regulated water and wastewater systems these acquisitions added approximately 2100 water customers and 2400 wastewater customers to our regulated operations during 2014 our military services group within our marketbased operations segment was awarded two us military contracts in january 2014 it was awarded a contract for operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at hill air force base in utah in august 2014 the military services group was awarded a contract for operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at picatinny arsenal in new jersey during 2014 our homeowners services group hos began offering its water and sewer line protection programs in eight new states additionally orlando utilities commission ouc awarded hos a contract to be oucs exclusive provider of service line protection programs this contract enables hos to market its water line sewer line inhome plumbing interior electric surge commercial water line and commercial sewer line protection programs to oucs 234000 customers in 2014 hos also launched its interior electric program and continued to develop new products and services to better meet customer needs

on november 4 2014 voters in haddonfield new jersey arnold missouri and russiaville indiana approved referendums for us to purchase their water andor wastewater assets following regulatory approval and financial close these three acquisitions will add approximately 19000 customers to the company’s regulated footprint additionally in february 2015 our illinois subsidiary entered into an agreement to purchase the city of mt vernon’s water and wastewater systems which serves about 6600 customer connections 

continuing improvement in om efficiency ratio for our regulated businesses 

we continued to improve on our om efficiency ratio during 2014 our om efficiency ratio was 367 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 385 and 407 for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the improvement in our 2014 om efficiency ratio in 2014 was principally attributable to the increase in our regulated businesses’ revenues as well as a decrease in adjusted om expenses compared to the same period in 2013

our om efficiency ratio a nongaap measure is defined as our regulated operation and maintenance expense divided by regulated operating revenues where both om expense and operating revenues are adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense we also excluded from operating revenues and om expenses the impact from weather and the west virginia freedom industries chemical spill additionally from the om expenses we exclude the allocable portion of nonom support services cost mainly depreciation and general taxes that are reflected in the regulated businesses segment as om costs but for consolidated financial reporting purposes are categorized within other lines in the statement of operations 

management believes that this calculation better reflects the regulated businesses segment’s om efficiency ratio we evaluate our operating performance using this measure as it is the primary measure of the efficiency of our regulated operations this information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance om efficiency ratio is not a measure defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report the following table provides a reconciliation between operation and maintenance expense and operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap and to those amounts utilized in the calculation of our om efficiency ratio for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012

comparison of consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

operating revenues consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 1324 million or 46 compared to the same period in 2013 this increase is the result of higher revenues in our regulated businesses of 804 million which was mainly attributable to rate increases incremental revenues from surcharges and balancing accounts and acquisitions partially offset by reduced consumption in 2014 also contributing to the higher revenue was a 521 million increase in our marketbased operations segment the primary drivers were incremental revenue from contract growth in hos and for our military contracts price redeterminations and increased construction project activity with the largest increase due to the fort polk wastewater treatment plant project awarded in late 2013 for further information see the respective “operating revenues” discussions within the “segment results” 

operation and maintenance  consolidated operation and maintenance expense for the year ended december 31 2014 increased 608 million or 47 compared to 2013 the increase is primarily due to an increase in our marketbased operations segment of 488 million principally as a result of incremental costs related to the increased activity under our military contracts corresponding with the increased revenue also our regulated businesses’ costs increased by 61 million principally due to increased production costs uncollectible expense maintenance expenses and costs associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia partially offset by lower employeerelated costs for further information see the respective “operation and maintenance” discussions within the “segment results” 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 174 million or 43 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of additional utility plant placed in service including our customer information and enterprise asset management systems that were placed into service during the second and fourth quarters of 2013 

other income expenses other expenses decreased by 476 million or 140 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year this decrease is principally attributable to the recognition of a pretax loss on debt extinguishment in 2013 of 406 million in connection with the cash tender offer for our 6085 senior notes due 2017 also contributing to the decrease was a reduction in interest expense resulting from interest savings as a result of our 2014 and 2013 refinancings offset by a reduction in allowance for funds used during construction “afudc” which is mainly attributable to our customer information and enterprise asset management systems being placed into service in the second and fourths quarters of 2013 

p rovision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 429 million or 181 to 2800 million for the year ended december 31 2014 the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 were 394 and 390 respectively the rate for the year ended december 31 2013 includes a 30 million tax benefit associated with a legal structure reorganization within our marketbased operations segment this strategic restructuring allowed us to utilize state net operating loss carryforwards which without the restructuring most likely would not have been utilized prior to their expiration 

loss from discontinued operations net of tax as previously noted the financial results of our terratec line of business within our marketbased operations segment was classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented the sale of terratec was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 the increase in the loss from discontinued operations net of tax is primarily related to the aftertax loss recorded on the sale of 23 million and lower operating results in 2014 compared to 2013 

comparison of consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

operating revenues consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 increased 250 million or 09 compared to the same period in 2012 this increase is the result of higher revenues in our regulated businesses of 295 million which was mainly attributable to rate increases partially offset by decreased consumption primarily related to weather for further information see the respective “operating revenues” discussions within the “segment results” 

operation and maintenance  consolidated operation and maintenance expense for the year ended december 31 2013 decreased 404 million or 30 compared to 2012 this change was mainly attributable to a 245 million decrease in our regulated businesses’ costs primarily related to a decrease in employeerelated costs primarily pension and group insurance expense as well as lower preventive maintenance expenses for further information see the respective “operation and maintenance” discussions within the “segment results” 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 263 million or 69 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of additional utility plant placed in service including our business transformation project which accounted for 108 million of the incremental expense in 2013 

 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by 134 million or 61 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 this increase was principally due to incremental taxes in the first half of 2013 associated with the properties acquired in our new york acquisition in the second quarter of 2012 also 2012 property taxes were lower due to the recognition of credit adjustments in indiana and missouri which reduced property tax expense in the third quarter of 2012 lastly gross receipts taxes were higher in our new jersey subsidiary by 35 million 

other income expenses other expenses increased 467 million or 159 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year this increase is principally attributable to the recognition of a pretax loss on debt extinguishment of 406 million in connection with the cash tender offer for our 6085 senior notes due 2017 the loss consisted of a repurchase premium of 394 million transaction fees of 07 million and a writeoff of 05 million for unamortized debt issuance costs also contributing to the increase was a reduction in allowance for funds used during construction “afudc” of 43 million resulting from decreased construction activities compared to the same period in 2012 including the winding down of our business transformation project

loss from discontinued operations net of tax as noted above the financial results of our regulated water and wastewater systems in arizona new mexico texas and ohio and our applied water management inc subsidiary within the marketbased operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented the loss in 2012 is primarily comprised of net losses recorded in connection with the disposition of our arizona new mexico and ohio subsidiaries 

segment results of operations 

we have two operating segments which are also our reportable segments the regulated businesses and the marketbased operations these segments are determined based on how we assess performance and allocate resources we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocated resources based on several factors with the primary measure being income from continuing operations before income taxes 

regulated businesses segment 

the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated businesses for the periods indicated 

 



 

operating revenues our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide services to residential commercial industrial and other customers this business is subject to state regulation and our results of operations can be impacted significantly by rates authorized by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate the table below details additional annualized revenues awarded including step increases and assuming a constant volume resulting from rate authorizations granted in 2014 2013 and 2012 

 



















the effective dates for the more significant increases granted in 2012 were january 1 2012 april 1 2012 may 1 2012 and october 1 2012 for our california missouri new jersey and illinois subsidiaries respectively 

 

as previously noted an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs such as mechanisms that permit a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure the following table details additional annualized revenues authorized through infrastructure surcharge mechanisms which were granted in 2014 2013 and 2012 as these surcharges are typically rolled into the new base rates and therefore are reset to zero when new base rates are effective certain of these charges may also be reflected in the total general rate case amounts awarded in the table above if the order date was following the infrastructure surcharge filing date 

 

















comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 

operating revenues increased by 804 million or 31 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 the increase in revenues is principally due to incremental revenues of approximately 800 million attributable to rate increases including infrastructure mechanisms obtained through rate authorizations for a number of our operating companies additionally revenues increased by 109 million due to an increase in surcharges and balancing accounts and by approximately 126 million attributable to acquisitions the most significant contributor to the increase in revenues from acquisitions was dale service corporation “dale” which was acquired by our virginia subsidiary in the fourth quarter of 2013 partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues of approximately 270 million as a result of lower demand 

 

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and billed water sales volume by customer class 

 



water services —consistent with the above discussion water service operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 totaled 25310 million a 660 million increase or 27 over the same period of 2013 as described above the increases are primarily due to rate increases infrastructure surcharges amortization of balancing accounts and recent acquisitions also it should be noted that the mix between billed revenues and unbilled revenues has changed this is principally the result of the implementation of our customer information system “cis” as part of phase ii of our business transformation project at december 31 2013 unbilled revenues were significantly higher than historical levels due to billing delays in certain accounts during the first quarter of 2014 we addressed a majority of these delayed billings therefore as a result the unbilled water revenues decreased by 556 million with corresponding increases in billed revenues 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 11 states revenues from these services increased 102 million or 124 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 the increase was primarily attributable to incremental revenues resulting from acquisitions most notably the dale acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2013 

other revenues —other revenues which includes such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees certain rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items increased 42 million or 91 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly due to 24 million in insurance proceeds for business interruption as a result of hurricane sandy in addition to an increase in late payment fees 

operation and maintenance expense operation and maintenance expense increased 61 million or 05 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 operation and maintenance expense for 2014 and 2013 by major expense category was as follows 

 



 

production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal costs increased by 180 million or 66 for 2014 compared to 2013 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 



 

overall production costs increased for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the prior year as a result of increases in purchased water fuel and power costs and waste disposal partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in chemicals due to a 18 million reversal of chemical expense resulting from a favorable litigation settlement the purchased water increases principally reflect increased prices in our california subsidiary and to a lesser extent price increases in our illinois subsidiary fuel and power costs increased due to higher supplier prices in several of our operating facilities as well as incremental costs as a result of the dale acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2013 the increase in waste disposal costs was principally due to an increase in the amount allowed by a cost recovery mechanism in one of our operating companies and the dale acquisition also contributing to the increase was incremental costs associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia

employeerelated costs including salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense decreased 258 million or 57 for 2014 compared to 2013 these employeerelated costs represented 387 and 412 of operation and maintenance expense for 2014 and 2013 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table 

 



 

the overall decrease in employeerelated costs for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily due to a reduction in pension costs and postretirement benefit costs which is included in group insurance expenses these decreases are principally due to the change in assumptions used for the discount rate which in turn resulted in decreased contributions the decrease in contributions occurred at those regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on our funding policy which is to fund at least the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in salaries and wages expense as a result of annual wage increases and increased overtime expense attributable to an increased number of main breaks as a result of the harsh winter weather conditions and increases in severance expense as a result of the restructuring of certain functions offset by a reduction in incentive compensation due to a lower than expected payout for the 2013 incentive period as well as higher capitalization rates as a result of increased capital projects

 

operating supplies and services include expenses for office operation legal and other professional services including transportation expenses information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges overall these costs remained relatively unchanged with an increase of 05 million or 02 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013

 



the increase in other operating supplies and services was primarily offset by a decrease in contracted services other operating supplies and services increased as a result of a 22 million increase in customer education and communication in california related to community relations and measure “0” and an 08 million increase in conservation expense as well as the inclusion in 2013 of 16 million of insurance proceeds for the recovery of expenses related to hurricanes irene and sandy and an increase in legal expenses the decrease in contracted services is primarily the result of the completion of our business transformation project consisting of the rollout of our enterprise asset management system and cis which required the use of additional contracted services in 2013 these decreases were partially offset by increases resulting from the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia 

maintenance materials and supplies which include preventive maintenance and emergency repair costs increased 22 million or 33 for 2014 compared to 2013

 



 

the increase for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 is primarily due to increases in paving backfilling and other repair costs most of which are from the higher than normal main breaks in the first quarter of 2014 due to the abnormally harsh winter weather conditions experienced throughout our operating areas 

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 88 million or 168 for 2014 compared to 2013

 



the increase for 2014 is primarily due to incremental uncollectible expense associated with an increase in customer accounts receivable attributable to the overall aging of receivables as well as rate increases we believe the change in our aging of receivables in 2014 is the result of temporary changes we made in our collection process in connection with the implementation of our new cis in 2013 including phase ii which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2013

 

other operation and maintenance expense includes casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 24 million or 55 for 2014 compared to 2013

 



 

the increase for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to an increase in our expected premiums principally due to incremental claims associated with the freedom industries chemical spill in west virginia net of favorable forecasted experience for existing claims these premiums are based upon current facts and circumstances with respect to outstanding claims and are subject to change as the claims mature the increase in insurance costs is partially offset by lower regulatory expenses in one of our operating subsidiaries compared to the same period in the prior year

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 is principally due to the higher operation and maintenance expenses explained above and higher depreciation and amortization expense of 182 million the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service including cis and our enterprise asset management system 

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

operating revenues increased by 295 million or 11 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 the increase in revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through rate authorizations for a number of our operating companies of which the impact was approximately 724 million additionally revenues increased by 164 million due to increased surcharge and amortization of balancing accounts lastly revenues were higher by 99 million as a result of acquisitions with the most significant being the result of our new york acquisition in the second quarter of 2012 additional four months of revenue in 2013 compared to 2012 and the acquisition of dale by our virginia subsidiary in the fourth quarter of 2013 these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of approximately 645 million as a result of lower demand principally driven by the hot and dry weather conditions in the central and northeast portions of the country in 2012 versus cooler and wetter weather conditions in 2013 

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and billed water sales volume by customer class 

 



water services —consistent with the above discussion water service operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 totaled 24650 million a 213 million increase or 09 over the same period of 2012 however the mix between billed revenuesbilled volumes to unbilled revenuesunbilled volumes changed significantly principally as a result of our cis 

 

implementation unbilled revenue increased 257 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly as a result of delayed invoicing to customers with the implementation we made a decision to increase the level of scrutiny and verification around bills being generated by the new system in particular larger andor more complex bills as such bills that exceed certain tolerance levels are being held until verification can be performed as such the timing of issuance of bills has caused a decrease in billed volumes in 2013 when compared to 2012 with a corresponding increase in unbilled usage for our residential and commercial customers we believe that the majority of the decline in billed volumes was attributable to the weather abnormalities between 2012 and 2013 as well as the implementation of our new cis system by our regulated subsidiaries for the remaining customer classes we believe the decline in billed volumes was mainly due to the delay in invoicing the customer as a result of our cis implementation 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in ten states revenues from these services increased by 47 million or 60 to 828 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from the same period of 2012 the increase was primarily attributable to rate increases in our pennsylvania subsidiary as well as the dale acquisition in november 2013 

other revenues —other revenues which includes such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees certain rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items increased 35 million or 82 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly due to the additional surcharge revenues offset by decreases in revenues related to billings for others reconnection and late fees 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense decreased 245 million or 22 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 operation and maintenance expense for 2013 and 2012 by major expense category was as follows   

 



 

production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal costs decreased by 36 million or 13 for 2013 compared to 2012 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 



overall production costs decreased for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year as a result of reductions in chemical and fuel and power costs resulting from decreased usage mainly attributable to lower consumption in most of our states 

 

employeerelated costs including salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense decreased 164 million or 35 for 2013 compared to 2012 these employeerelated costs represented 412 and 418 of operation and maintenance expense for 2013 and 2012 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table

 



the overall decrease in employeerelated costs was primarily attributable to decreased salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense the decrease in salaries and wages was mainly the result of lower employee incentive and stock compensation expense of approximately 59 million in addition to higher capitalization rates due to increased capital investment and a reduction in headcount partially offset by increased overtime and annual wage increases the decrease in pension expense was primarily due to decreased contributions in certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on our funding policy which is to fund at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 or the normal cost the reduction in group insurance expense is mainly attributable to higher capitalization rates and reduced headcount 

operating supplies and services include expenses for office operation legal and other professional services including transportation expenses information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges overall these costs increased 48 million or 23 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 

 



the overall increase in operating supplies and services was primarily due to increased contracted services and higher other operating supplies and services these increases were mainly due to incremental costs attributable to the continued maturity of our enterprise resource planning system in conjunction with the implementation of phase i and phase ii of our business transformation project additionally contracted services increased due to the use of contractors for other specific projects other increases in the other operating supplies and services costs are related to a 13 million increase in condemnation costs and a 12 million increase in conservation expense as well as the inclusion in 2012 of a 10 million reduction in anticipated insurance recovery of expenses incurred as a result of hurricane sandy and a 21 million credit adjustment resulting from the finalization of rate decisions in california and are offset by 16 million of insurance proceeds related to recovery of expenses related to hurricanes irene and sandy received in 2013 the decrease in office supplies and services is due to cost containment efforts primarily related to employee travel transportation costs decreased due to the reduction of leased vehicles 

maintenance materials and services which includes emergency repair as well as costs for preventive maintenance decreased 152 million or 188 for 2013 compared to 2012 

 



 

the decrease of 152 million in 2013 is mainly attributable to 2012 including increased preventive maintenance expenses throughout our regulated subsidiaries including hydrant and tank painting meter testing pump tank and well maintenance and paving costs 

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 34 million or 68 for 2013 compared to 2012 

 



the increase in the uncollectible accounts expense was primarily due to an increase in our regulated businesses’ customer accounts receivable attributable to rate increases and an increase in the overall aging of receivables due to our cis implementation 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 25 million or 60 for 2013 compared to 2012 

 



insurance costs in 2013 were higher compared to 2012 primarily due to higher casualty insurance costs as a result of historical claims experience and retroactive adjustments 

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to the higher om expenses as explained above as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense of 263 million and higher general tax expense of 124 million the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service including 108 million of incremental expense resulting from the assets placed in service for our business transformation project the increase in general tax expense is primarily due to higher property taxes in our new york subsidiary due to a full year of expense in 2013 on properties acquired in the second quarter of 2012 of 52 million the inclusion of property tax adjustments that reduced expense for our indiana and missouri subsidiaries by 40 million in 2012 and higher 2013 gross receipts taxes in our new jersey subsidiary of 35 million 

marketbased operations segment 

the following table provides certain financial information for our marketbased operations segment for the periods indicated 

 



comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013

operating revenues the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 is primarily attributable to incremental military service group revenues of 394 million mainly from an increase in construction project activities for our military contracts and an increase in our homeowners services group “hos” revenues of approximately 162 

 

million principally the result of contract growth mainly though our new york city contracts as well as expansion into other geographic areas and price increases for certain existing customers partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of our contract operations group conop revenues attributable to the termination of certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts additionally included in the 2013 military service group revenues was 54 million in retroactive price redeterminations for several of our military contracts 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 488 million or 203 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the year ended december 31 2013 

the following table provides information regarding categories of operation and maintenance expense for the periods indicated

 



as noted in the table above the primary factor contributing to the overall increase was an increase in operating supplies and services this increase is mainly attributable to the increase in construction project activities under our military contracts and corresponds with the incremental revenues another factor contributing to this increase was the inclusion in 2013 of the release of 38 million in loss contract reserves due to the resolution of certain outstanding issues and uncertainties maintenance materials and supplies increased primarily due to higher hos repair costs which is attributable to the increase in the number of contracts 

operating expense the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 is primarily driven by the increase in operation and maintenance expense explained above 

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012

operating revenues revenues decreased 48 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to lower revenues of 144 million resulting from the termination of certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts most of which occurred in 2012 additionally revenues from construction project activities associated with military construction contracts decreased 84 million due to lower levels of work as compared to the prior year these decreases were offset by a net increase of 40 million from price redeterminations for several of our military contracts as well as an increase of 166 million in our hos revenues associated with contract growth most notably in new york city 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense decreased 157 million or 61 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 

the following table provides information regarding categories of operation and maintenance expense for the periods indicated 

 



as noted in the table above decreases in operating supplies and services production costs and employeerelated costs were partially offset by an increase in maintenance materials and supplies the decrease in production costs and employeerelated costs is mostly due to the termination of certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts the decrease in operating 

 

supplies and services is attributable to the release of 38 million in loss contract reserves due to the resolution of certain outstanding issues and uncertainties additionally 2013 was impacted by decreased construction project activity for our military contracts and is partially offset by increased hos contracted services expense as well as higher printing and postage costs associated with expanding into new markets including new york city the increase in maintenance materials and supplies is primarily due to higher hos repair costs which is attributable to new contracts an increase in the number of claims as well as the average cost per claim and is partially offset by the terminated municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts the decrease in the other category is mainly due to decreases in uncollectible accounts expense of 35 million which is due to 2012 including incremental amounts related to terminated contracts in addition to improved collection experience in 2013 for certain other municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts 

operating expense the decrease in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily driven by the decrease in operation and maintenance expense which is explained above 

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures our business is very capital intensive and requires significant capital resources a majority of these capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations when necessary we obtain additional funds from external sources in the debt and equity capital markets and through bank borrowings our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets if these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms we have access to an unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of 125 billion we rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to support our commercial paper program disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets see “—credit facility and shortterm debt” in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we through awcc our financing subsidiary issue commercial paper which is supported by the revolving credit facility awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 380 million of outstanding letters of credit under its credit facility as of december 31 2014 as of december 31 2014 awcc had 125 billion available under the credit facility that we could use to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and support our 4500 million outstanding commercial paper we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated operating companies receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines 

we use our capital resources including cash to i fund operating and capital requirements including construction expenditures ii pay off maturing debt iii pay dividends iv fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and v invest in new and existing ventures we spend a significant amount of cash on construction projects that we expect to have a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag see “business—regulation—economic regulation” we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since we continue to make investments equal to or greater than our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

we believe that our ability to access the capital markets our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our shortterm requirements we fund liquidity needs for capital investment working capital and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations public and private debt offerings commercial paper markets and to the extent necessary our revolving credit facility we believe we have sufficient liquidity and ability to manage our expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets 

in addition the company can delay major capital investments or other funding requirements or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by among other things economic utility regulation infrastructure investment inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining per customer usage of water weather and seasonality and overall economic conditions 

cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditure requirements we will seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed there can be no assurance that we will be able to access such markets successfully on favorable terms or at all operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated 

 



 





our working capital needs are primarily limited to funding the increase in our customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues which is mainly associated with the revenue increase as a result of rate increases in our regulated businesses we address the timing issue through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms 

the increase in cash flows from operations for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 is principally due to the improvement in the cash collections of our regulated businesses’ accounts receivable some of which were unbilled at december 31 2013 cash collections in 2013 for our regulated businesses’ accounts receivable were slower than historical payment patterns mainly due to the implementation of our cis system in may 2013 we believe the slowdown in collections is the result of the system implementation and therefore is temporary in nature we implemented the cis system in our remaining regulated businesses in october 2013 and we have experienced a similar slowdown in cash collections for these operating companies in 2014 

the decrease in cash flows from operations for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 is principally due to changes in working capital which is related to the aforementioned delays in billing and slower collections in our accounts receivable in our regulated businesses and the change in payables in 2013 as we were delayed in 2012 in executing payables at normal volumes due to the implementation of phase i of our business transformation project partially offsetting these working capital decreases was a reduction in the pension and postretirement healthcare contributions in 2013 

the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 545 million in 2015 of which 61 million was already made in 2015 in addition we estimate that contributions will amount to 556 million in 2016 527 million in 2017 567 million in 2018 and 663 million in 2019 actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows for the periods indicated 

 



 



cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2014 principally as a result of incremental spending associated with the replacement of our transmission and distribution infrastructure 

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

while capital expenditures were 9561 million total capital investment amounted to 10 billion the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures related to upgrading our infrastructure and systems 

 



capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2014 decreased by 241 million or 25 compared to 2013 principally due to the completion of phase i and phase ii of our business transformation project 

capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2013 increased by 517 million or 56 compared to 2012 principally due to our continued replacement of transmission and distribution infrastructure rehabilitation to storage facilities and dam rehabilitation and increased expenditures related to information systems and vehicles partially offsetting this increase was reduction in treatment and pumping expenditures due to the completion of certain water treatment plant projects in 2012 as well as a reduction in our business transformation expenses also due to completion of phase i of the project in 2012 and the implementation of a portion of phase ii in may 2013 

one avenue to seek growth is through tuckins by helping commissions with troubled water systems as well as other acquisitions that are complementary to our existing business and support the continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt or equity offerings 

 

the following provides a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities in the years indicated 

2014 

we paid approximately 89 million for 13 water and wastewater systems 

we received approximately 19 million for the sale of assets and securities 

2013 

we paid approximately 237 million for ten water and five wastewater system these acquisitions added approximately 30000 customers to our existing regulated footprint the largest of these acquisitions was the acquisition of the stock of a wastewater system in virginia with approximately 20000 customers in november 2013 for a purchase price of 51 million net of cash acquired of 69 million plus assumed liabilities 

we received approximately 09 million for the sale of assets and securities 

2012 

we paid approximately 446 million for numerous regulated water and wastewater systems in new york pennsylvania indiana missouri and west virginia with the largest associated with the acquisition of seven regulated water systems in new york in may 2012 for a purchase price of 367 million plus assumed liabilities 

we received approximately 5617 million from the sale of our assets and securities including 4589 million associated with the sale of our arizona new mexico and ohio regulated subsidiaries 

as previously noted in 2015 we estimate that our total capital plan is 12 billion with approximately 11 billion allocated to upgrading our infrastructure and systems including infrastructure renewal programs and construction of facilities to meet environmental requirements and new customer growth and 01 billion for acquisitions and strategic investment purposes for years in the foreseeable future beyond 2015 we estimate such investment will be between 11 and 12 billion per year 

we intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base while working with regulators in the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment 

our investing activities could require considerable capital resources which we have generated through operations and attained through financing activities we can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc we intend to access capital markets on a regular basis subject to market conditions in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds this amounted to 263 million 193 million and 319 million for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as previously noted awcc is a whollyowned finance subsidiary of the company based on the needs of our regulated subsidiaries and the company awcc borrows in the capital markets and then through intercompany loans provides those borrowings to the regulated subsidiaries and the company the regulated subsidiaries and the company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations because the company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated subsidiaries the company is not able to recover the interest charges on the company’s debt through regulated water and wastewater rates as of december 31 2014 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to our regulated businesses amounting to 30 billion and 3192 million respectively additionally as of december 31 2014 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the company totaling 9799 million and 1308 million to the company respectively

from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements via tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

in february 2015 our board of directors authorized a common stock repurchase program for the specific purpose of providing a vehicle to minimize share dilution that occurs through its dividend reinvestment employee stock purchase and executive compensation programs this program will allow the company to purchase up to 10 million shares of its outstanding common stock over an unrestricted period of time to manage dilution under the program the company may repurchase its common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions the program will be conducted in accordance with rule 10b18 of the exchange act as amended and to facilitate the purchases the company has also entered into with a broker a rule 10b51 share repurchase plan by having the program administered through a rule 10b51 plan the company will be able to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of selfimposed trading blackout periods subject to applicable regulations the company may elect to amend or cancel the program or the rule 10b51 parameters at its discretion 

credit facility and shortterm debt 

the shortterm debt balance consisting of commercial paper net of discount amounted to 4500 million and 6303 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

awcc has entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility with 125 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of 14 banks with 700 million maturing on october 2017 and the remainder 118 billion maturing on october 2018 interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the eurodollar rate or base rate with the credit spread of 100 through june 2012 and then based on the higher of awcc’s moody’s investors service which we refer to as moody’s or standard  poor’s ratings services ratings which we refer to as sp credit rating at current ratings that spread would be 100 the facility will be principally used to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 1500 million in letters of credit 

we closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with this credit facility in accordance with the credit agreement no financial institution can have more than 2500 million of the aggregate commitment through the facility expiration date if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances the company may request the other lenders to assume the defaulting lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment however the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender’s commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to replace a defaulting lender

the weightedaverage interest rate on shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 was approximately 031 and 043 respectively 

capital structure 

the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

 



the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to changes in outstanding commercial paper balances 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue new debt or access our revolving credit facility for two of our smaller operating companies we have informed our counterparties that we will provide only unaudited financial information at the subsidiary level which resulted in technical noncompliance with certain of their reporting requirements we do not believe this change will materially impact us our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facility could accelerate repayment obligations our longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things limit the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions 

certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization as defined in the relevant documents of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2014 our ratio was 055 to 100 and therefore we were in compliance with the covenant 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets is directly affected by securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets we primarily access the capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we also issue debt at our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities or borrowings under state revolving funds to lower our overall cost of debt 

on june 2 2014 standard  poor’s rating service revised its rating outlook to positive from stable and affirmed its corporate credit rating of a on awcc and american water and of a2 on awcc’s short term rating on may 29 2013 moody’s upgraded its rating outlook for both american water and awcc from baa2 to baa1 and revised its rating outlook to stable 

 

the following table shows the company’s securities ratings as of december 31 2014 

 



a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that we provide collateral to secure our obligations we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend practice to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends rather than retaining that cash for other purposes we expect that dividends will be paid quarterly to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock will not be cumulative only declared dividends will be paid 

during 2014 2013 and 2012 we paid 2164 million 1495 million and 2135 million in dividends respectively for 2014 we paid a dividend of 028 per share on march 3 and 031 per share on june 2 september 2 and december 1 in 2013 we paid a dividend of 028 per share on december 2 september 3 and june 3

for 2012 we paid a dividend of 025 per share on december 28 december 3 and september 3 and 023 per share on june 1 and march 1 the december 28 2012 cash dividend payment of 025 per share would have historically been paid in march 2013 however the board approved accelerating the payment date to 2012 to take advantage of the existing 2012 tax rates 

on december 12 2014 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 031 per share payable on march 2 2015 to shareholders of record as of february 9 2015 

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt or equity securities at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims additionally annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going forward basis we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into obligations with t hird parties in the ordinary course of business these financial obligations as of december 31 2014 are set forth in the table below 

 



 

note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our marketbased operations are not included in the above amounts 





















publicprivate partnerships 

west virginiaamerican water company which we refer to as wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

wvawc leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities which is presented within utility plant was approximately 1568 million at december 31 2014 

 

performance obligations 

we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2064 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenues of 25 billion at december 31 2014 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2015 and 2048 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 8658 million at december 31 2014 some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

our financial condition results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we account for these regulated operations in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements use of the authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria 1 thirdparty regulation of rates 2 costbased rates and 3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates as of december 31 2014 we concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow for recovery through rates charged to customers regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred as of december 31 2014 we have recorded 12 billion of net regulatory assets and 3918 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our statement of operations and financial position could be materially affected 

goodwill 

the company has recorded 12 billion of goodwill at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company’s annual impairment test is performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

the company performs a twostep impairment test to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit if qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the reporting units’ fair values are less than their carrying values the 

 

step one calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the estimated fair value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values including goodwill on the measurement date if the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step two is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step two calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

after assessing various events and circumstances in 2014 2013 and 2012 the company determined that no qualitative factors were present that would indicate the estimated fair values of its reporting units were less than the respective carrying values as such the company determined that the twostep goodwill impairment test was not necessary at november 30 2014 2013 and 2012 

there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge 

no impairment charge was recorded for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer invoice to the end of the accounting period unbilled utility revenues as of december 31 2014 and 2013 were 2205 million and 2157 million respectively increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and 

 

rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue however since the majority of our customers are generally billed on a monthly basis total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged 

revenue from marketbased operations is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the costs incurred to date during the period compared to the total estimated costs over the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

accounting for income taxes 

significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities valuation allowances and the utilization of nol carryforwards 

in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance we account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a twostep approach including a morelikelythannot recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement if it is not morelikelythannot that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical merits no benefit is recorded uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 

we evaluate the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and our intent and ability to implement tax planning strategies if necessary to realize deferred tax assets we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when we conclude it is morelikelythannot such benefit will not be realized in future periods 

actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws our forecasted financial condition and results of operations failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2014 and 2013 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance the ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation the pension plans have been closed for all employees the pension plans were closed for most employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2006 are provided with a 525 of base pay defined contribution plan we also maintain other postretirement benefit plans which provide varying levels of medical and life insurance for eligible retirees these retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 the company also has several unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees the company does not participate in a multiemployer plan see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience 

 

over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 











the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices we use an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds the yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 424 512 and 417 at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 424 510 and 416 at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 691 for 2014 749 for 2013 and 775 for 2012 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 587 for 2014 699 for 2013 and 741 for 2012 

the asset allocations for the company’s us pension plan at december 31 2014 and 2013 by asset category are as follows 

 



the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocations for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2014 and 2013 by asset category are as follows 

 



the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 484 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 516 of the assets are valued using other inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 312 for 2014 315 for 2013 and 319 for 2012 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 700 in 2014 gradually declining to 500 in 2019 and thereafter 

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 



we will use a discount rate and eroa of 424 and 691 respectively for estimating our 2015 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and eroa of 424 and 587 respectively for estimating our 2015 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2014 and 2013 pension and postretirement costs including such expenses charged to our discontinued operations were 241 million and 781 million respectively the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 545 million 556 million 527 million 567 million and 663 million in 2015 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

new accounting standards 

the following recently issued accounting standards have been adopted by the company and have been included in the consolidated results of operations financial position or footnotes of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance for the recognition measurement and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date examples of obligations within the scope of the updated guidance include debt arrangements other contractual 

 

obligations and settled litigation and judicial rulings the update requires an entity to measure obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation is fixed at the reporting date as the sum of the following a the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its coobligors and b any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its coobligors the updated guidance also includes additional disclosures regarding the nature and amount of the obligation as well as other information about those obligations the update was effective on a retrospective basis for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 which for the company was january 1 2014 the adoption of this updated guidance did not have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows

foreign currency matters 

in june 2013 the fasb issued guidance for a parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity the amendments resolve differing views in practice and apply to the release of the cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a parent either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or a business within a foreign entity the update was effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 which for the company was january 1 2014 the adoption of this updated guidance did not have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows

the following recently issued accounting standards are not yet required to be adopted by the company

service concession arrangements 

in january 2014 the fasb issued guidance for an operating entity that enters into a service concession arrangement with a public sector grantor who controls or has the ability to modify or approve the services that the operating entity must provide with the infrastructure to whom it must provide the services and at what price the grantor also controls through ownership or otherwise any residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement the guidance specifies that an operating entity should not account for the service concession arrangement as a lease the operating entity should refer instead to other accounting guidance to account for the various aspects of the arrangement the guidance also specifies that the infrastructure used in the arrangement should not be recognized as property plant and equipment of the operating entity this update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to service concession arrangements that exist at the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year of adoption this requires the cumulative effect of applying the update to be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance for the annual period of adoption the update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2014 which for the company is january 1 2015 the adoption of this updated guidance resulted in a decrease to nonutility property and opening retained earnings of approximately 12 million on january 1 2015

reporting discontinued operations

in april 2014 the fasb issued guidance that changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements under the updated guidance a discontinued operation is defined as a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results a strategic shift could include a disposal of a major geographical area of operations a major line of business a major equity method investment or other major part of the entity a component comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity including a reportable segment an operating segment a reporting unit a subsidiary or an asset group the update no longer precludes presentation as a discontinued operation if there are operations and cash flows of the component that have not been eliminated from the reporting entity’s ongoing operations or if there is significant continuing involvement with a component after its disposal the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for interim and annual periods on or after december 15 2014 which for the company is january 1 2015 in general this guidance is likely to result in fewer disposals of assets qualifying as discontinued operations but will ultimately be based on the company’s future disposal activity

revenue from contracts with customers 

in may 2014 the fasb issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industryspecific guidance the core principle of the new guidance is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning december 15 2016 which for the company is january 1 2017 early adoption is not permitted the new guidance allows for either full retrospective adoption meaning the guidance is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements the company is evaluating the 

 

new guidance the best transition method and the impact the new standard will have on its results of operations financial position or cash flows

accounting for stockbased compensation with performance targets

in june 2014 the fasb issued guidance for the accounting for stockbased compensation tied to performance targets the amendments clarify that a performance target that affects vesting of a sharebased payment and that could be achieved after the requisite service period is a performance condition as a result the target is not reflected in the estimation of the award’s grant date fair value and compensation cost would be recognized over the required service period if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved the updated guidance may be applied either a prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or b retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter the updated guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 which for the company is january 1 2016 early adoption is permitted the company is evaluating the impact the updated guidance will have on its results of operations financial position or cash flows

disclosures of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern

in august 2014 the fasb issued guidance that explicitly requires an entity’s management to assess the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern the new guidance requires an entity to evaluate at each interim and annual period whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued and to provide related disclosures if applicable the new guidance is effective for annual periods ending after december 15 2016 and for interim and annual periods thereafter which for the company is january 1 2017 early adoption is permitted the adoption of this updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on results of operations financial position or cash flows

hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share

in november 2014 the fasb updated the derivatives and hedging guidance requiring issuers of or investors in hybrid financial instruments to determine whether the nature of the host contract is more akin to a debt instrument or an equity instrument by considering the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument including the embedded derivative feature that is being evaluated for separate accounting from the host contract this update should be applied on a modified retrospective basis to hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share that exist at the beginning of an entity’s fiscal year of adoption the updated guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 which for the company is january 1 2016 early adoption is permitted the company is evaluating the impact the updated guidance will have on its results of operations financial position or cash flows

extraordinary and unusual items

in january 2015 the fasb issued guidance that eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item as a result an entity will no longer segregate an extraordinary item and present it separately from the results of ordinary operations or separately disclose income taxes or earnings per share information applicable to an extraordinary item the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently has been retained and expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring the updated guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2015 which for the company is january 1 2016 early adoption is permitted the updated guidance may be applied prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements the adoption of this updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on results of operations financial position or cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2014 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in a 45 million decrease in our pretax earnings 

 

in july 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 1000 million this agreement effectively converted the interest on 1000 million of outstanding 6085 fixed rate debt maturing 2017 to a variable rate of sixmonth libor plus 3422 we entered into this interest rate swap to mitigate interest cost at the parent company relating to debt that was incurred by our prior owners and was not used in any manner to finance the cash needs of our subsidiaries for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 the interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 23 million and 20 million respectively as the swap interest rates are fixed through april 2015 a hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rates associated with the interest swap agreement would result in a 07 million decrease on our pretax earnings for the year ended december 31 2014 this calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates 

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the ability to recover price increases through rates nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations many of which are unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated activities for both our regulated businesses and marketbased operations our regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while our marketbased operations engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates in addition pension and other benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields 

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

our industry 

overview 

the united states water and wastewater industry has two main sectors i utility ownership which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers and ii general services which involves providing water and wastewater related services to water and wastewater utilities and other customers on a contract basis 

the utility sector includes investorowned as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions the environmental protection agency “epa” estimates that governmentowned systems account for approximately 84 of all united states community water systems and approximately 98 o f all united states community wastewater systems investorowned water and wastewater systems including a small number of private companies and developers account for the remainder of the united states water and wastewater community water systems growth of service providers in the investorowned regulated utility sector is achieved through organic growth within a franchise area the provision of bulk water service to other community water systems andor acquisitions including small water and wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers that are in close geographic proximity to already established regulated operations which we herein refer to as “tuckins” 

the utility sector is characterized by high barriers to entry given the capital intensive nature of the industry the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in constant need of modernization and replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of water and wastewater residu als’ discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization the epa estimated that the nation’s drinking water utilities need 3842 billion in infrastructure investments for thousands of miles of pipe as well as thousands of treatment plants storage tanks and other key assets between 2011 and 2030 to ensure the public health security and economic wellbeing of our cities towns and communities also in 2007 the epa estimated that approximately 390 billion of capital spending would be necessary over the next 20 years to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states in addition the 2011 american society of civil engineers’ “asce” report failure to act the economic impact of current investment trends in water and wastewater treatment infrastructure estimated that as investment needs continue to escalate and current funding trends continue to fall short of the needs it will likely result in unreliable water service and wastewater treatment according to the report this can result in water disruptions impediments to emergency response and damage to other types of infrastructure such as roads and bridges as well as water shortages from failing infrastructure and drought that may result in unsanitary conditions and increase the likelihood of public health issues in its most recent 2013 asce report card for america’s infrastructure it gave the water and wastewater infrastructure a grade of “d” due to the fact that much of the infrastructure is nearing the end of its useful life the report concluded that there will be an investment gap between now and 2020 of 84 billion for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure 

note numbers may not total due to roundingsource us environmental protection agencys 2011 drinking water infrastructure needs survey and assessment note numbers may not total due to roundingsource us environmental protection agencys 2011 drinking water infrastructure needs survey and assessment the following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2011 through 2030 for united states water systems 

for 2014 to 2018 we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will amount to approximately 58 billion of the 58 billion 51 billion is anticipated to be utilized to upgrade our infrastructure and systems in addition to these capital expenditures we are also estimating additional capital investment over the fiveyear period for acquisitions and f or strategic capital of approximately 400 million and 300 million respectively strategic investments could include opportunities in the unregulated shale arena or a major concession our total capital plan for 2014 is estimated to be 11 billion with approximately 900 million allocated to upgrading our infrastructure and systems including infrastructure renewal programs and construction of facilities to meet environmental requirements and new customer growth in addition to the 900 million in infrastructure upgrades the capital investment plan for 2014 also includes 100 million for acquisitions and 100 million for strategic investment purposes the charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures over the period of 2014 to 2018 for upgrading our infrastructure and systems by asset type and purpose of investment respectively 

 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generally require regulatory approval processes in order to do business which may involve obtaining relevant operating approvals including certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations from state pucs investorowned water and wastewater systems are generally subject to economic regulation by the state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety an d water quality matters for both investorowned and governmentowned water and wastewater utilities 

the general services sector includes engineering and consulting companies and numerous other feeforservice businesses these include building and operating water and wastewater utility systems system repair services lab services sale of water infrastructure and distribution products such as pipes and other specialized services the general services segment is characterized by aggressive competition a nd marketdriven growth and profit margins 

according to the epa the utility segment of the united states water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented with approximately 54000 community water systems and approximately 15000 community wastewater facilities over half of the community water systems are very small serving a population of 500 or less 

this large number of relatively small fragmented water systems as well as fragmented wastewater facilities may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities larger utilities that have greater access to capital ar e generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time 

water and wastewater rates 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generate operating revenue from customers based on rates that are generally established by state pucs through a ratesetting process that may include public hearings evidentiary hearings and the submission by the utility of evidence and testimony in support of the requested level of rates in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on six areas i the amount and pru dence of investment in facilities considered “used and useful” in providing public service ii the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service typically by making reference to a representative 12month period of time known as a test year iii the appropriate rate of return iv revenue produced by existing rates v the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements across the customer base and vi the quality of service the utility provides including issues raised by customers 

water and wastewater rates in the united states are among the lowest for developed countries and for most us consumers water and wastewater bills make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services the following chart sets forth the relative cost of water and other public services including trash and garbage collection and sewer maintenance in the united states as a percentage of total household utility expenditu res

our regulated businesses 

our regulated businesses consist of locally managed utility subsidiaries that generally are subject to economic regulation by the states in which they operate our regulated businesses provide a high degree of financial stability because i high barriers to entry provide certain protections from competitive pressures ii economic regulation promotes predictability in financial planning and longterm performance through the ratesetting process and iii our large customer base 

during 2012 we continued to execute our plan for optimizing our regulated businesses’ portfolio in january 2012 we completed the sale of all of our stock in our water and wastewater operating companies located in arizona and new mexico on may 1 2012 we completed the sale of our eight regulated water systems and one wastewater system in ohio ohio american water served approximately 5800 0 customers also on may 1 2012 we completed the purchase of seven regulated water systems in new york this acquisition added approximately 50000 customers to our new york regulated operations 

in may 2011 we completed the acquisition of 11 regulated water systems and 48 wastewater systems in missouri and in june 2011 we completed the sale of the assets of our texas regulated subsidiary the missouri acquisition added approximately 1700 water customers and nearly 2000 wastewater customers the tex as assets served approximately 4200 water and 1100 wastewater customers in the greater houston metropolitan area 

as noted above as a result of these sales these regulated subsidiaries are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented therefore the amounts statistics and tables presented in this section refer only to ongoing operations unless otherwise noted 

the following table sets forth our regulated businesses operating revenue for 2013 and number of customers from continuing operations as well as an estimate of population served as of december 31 2013 

  



 







approximately 875  of operating revenue from our regulated businesses in 2013 was generated from approximately 27 million customers in our seven largest states as measured by operating revenues in fiscal year 2013 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our annual operating revenue 

overview of networks facilities and water supply 

our regulated businesses operate in approximately 1500 communities in 16 states in the united states our primary operating assets include 87 dams al ong with approximately 80 surface water treatment plants 500 groundwater treatment plants 1000 groundwater wells 100 wastewater treatment facilities 1200 treated water storage facilities 1300 pumping stations and 47000 miles of mains and collection pipes our regulated utilities own substantially all of the assets used by our regulated businesses we generally own the land and physical assets used to store extract and treat source water typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our regulated businesses we have ongoing infrastructure renewal programs in all states in which our regulated businesses operate these programs consist of both rehabilitation of existing mains and replacement of mains that have reached the end of their useful service lives 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water we employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of th e economic effect of weather extremes we might encounter in any particular service territory in any given summer some areas are likely to experience drier than average weather while other areas we serve will experience wetter than average weather 

as noted our regulated businesses are dependent upon a defined source of water supply and obtain their water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams in addition we also obtain water from ground water sources such as w ells and purchase water from other water suppliers the following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our regulated businesses for 2013 by volume 

 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we use planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions 

surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development 

the percentage of finished water supply by source type for our top seven states by regulated businesses revenues for 2013 is as follows 

 



 





the level of treatment we apply to the water varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources such as rivers typically require significant treatment while some groundwater sources such as aquifers require chemical treatment only in addition a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water purveyors treated water is transported through our transmission and distribution network which includes underground pipes above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water to the customers’ premises 

we also have installed production meters to measure the water that we deliver to our distribution network we employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption ranging from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices touch read or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the maj ority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards the treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent and the solid waste by product of the treatment process is disposed of in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

customers 

we have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our regulated businesses an active customer is defined as a party with an active agreement to receive a specific service from a connection to our water or wastewater system as of the last business day of each monthly reporting period also as in the case of apartment complexes businesses and many homes multiple individuals may be served by a single contract 

residential customers make up the majority of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate in 2013 residential customers accounted for 91 0 of the customers and 593 of the operating revenue of our regulated businesses we also serve commercial customers such as shops and businesses industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we also supply water to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities as well as providing bulk water supplies to other water utilities for distribution to their own customers 

the following table sets forth the number of water and wastewater customers by customer class for our regulated businesses as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 



the following table sets forth water services operating revenues by customer class and wastewater services operating revenues excluding other revenues for our regulated businesses for 2013 2012 and 2011 

 



 

the following table sets forth billed sales volumes by customer class for our regulated businesses for 2013 2012 and 2011 

 



 

the vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption typically on a monthly basis our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption 

customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions particularly during the summer our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenue s and operating income summer weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues and operating income however when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies thereby reducing customer usage and operating revenues these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands other factors affecting our customers’ usage of water include conservation initiatives such as the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers declining household sizes in the united states and changes in the economy and credit markets which could have significant impacts on our industrial and commercial customers’ operational and financial performance 

customer growth in our regulated businesses is driven by i organic population growth in our authorized service areas ii adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water andor wastewater utility systems and iii the sale of water to other community water systems generally we add customers through tuckins of small water andor wast ewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers in close geographic proximity to areas where we operate our regulated businesses we will continue to acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuckins the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies historically pursuing tuckins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate certain markets in the united states where we do not operate our regulated businesses we will also selectively seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing and new markets before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for quality reliability and compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality standards 

supplies 

our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals energy and fuel as well as maintenance material and other critical inputs many of these inputs are subject to shortterm price volatility shortterm price volatility is partially mitigated through existing proc urement contracts current supplier continuity plans the regulatory rate setting process and rate mechanisms 

because of our geographic diversity we maintain relationships with many chemical equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace and we do not rely on any single entity for a significant amount of our supplies we also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and longterm cost effectiveness as a result of this process and our strong relationships with suppliers we are able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations 

we typically have a combination of standby power generation or dual electric service feeds at key facilities multiple water production facilities emergency interconnections with adjacent water systems and finished water storage that keep our operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies 

regulation 

economic regulation 

our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective pucs the term “economic regulation” is intended to indicate that these state pucs regulate the economic aspects of service to the public but do not generally establish water q uality standards which are typically set by the epa andor state environmental authorities state pucs have broad authority to regulate many of the economic and service aspects of the utilities for example state pucs often issue certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations that may be required for a company to provide service in specific areas they also approve the rates and conditions under which service is provided and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions and relationships between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations mergers and acquisitions in many instances approvals are required prior to the transaction regulatory policies not only vary from state to state but can change over time as well these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the pucs in the states in which we operate and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate case delays or inadequate rate recovery 

economic regulation of utilities involves many competing and occasionally conflicting public interests and policy goals the primary responsibility of pucs is to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and the utility although the specific approach to economic regulation varies certain general principles are consistent across the states in which ou r regulated subsidiaries operate for example based on certain legal and regulatory principles utilities are entitled to recover through rates charged to customers prudent and reasonable operating costs as well as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on and recovery of prudent used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers pucs will also generally accord a utility the right to serve specific areas and will also provide investorowned utilities with limited protection from competition because the requirement of an investorowned utility to operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations typically prevents other investorowned utilities from competing with it in the authorized area in return the utility undertakes the obligation to provide reliable service without unreasonable discrimination to all customers within the authorized area 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to a volumetric charge based on consumption and a base fee component set by a tariff approved by the puc the process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally involves filing a petition or “rate case” by the utility with the puc on a periodic basis as determined by th e need to recover capital expenditures a reduction in operating revenues due to reduced consumption increased operating costs or the utility determines that its current authorized return is not sufficient given current market conditions to provide a reasonable return on investment a puc may also initiate a rate proceeding or investigation if it believes a utility may be earning in excess of its authorized rate of return or other issues exist which justify a review pucs may also impose other conditions on the content and timing of filings designed to affect rates rate cases often involve a lengthy administrative process that can be costly the utility the state puc staff consumer advocates and other customers and interveners who may participate in the process generally submit testimony and supporting financial data from a twelve month period of time known as the “test year” state statutes and puc rules and precedent usually determine whether the test year should be based on a historical period a historical period adjusted for certain “known and measurable” changes or forecasted data the majority of our states use a forecasted test year the evidence is presented in public hearings held in connection with the rate case which are economic and service quality factfinding in nature and are typically conducted in a triallike setting before the puc or an administrative law judge during the process the utility is required to provide puc staff and interveners with all relevant information they may request concerning the utility’s operations costs and investments the decision of the puc should be based on the evidence presented at the hearing 

state pucs differ with regard to the types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their ratemaking processes and how they reach their final rate determinations however in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on a number of areas including the amount and prudence of investmen t in facilities operating and maintenance expenses and taxes the appropriate cost of capital and equity return revenues or consumption at current and expected levels allocation of the revenue requirements among customer classes service quality and issues raised by customers 

failure of the pucs to recognize reasonable and prudent operating and capital costs can result in the inability of the utility to earn the allowed return and can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete therefore there is frequently a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating cost increase and when those costs are reflected in rates for instance an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not begin to be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until the effective date of the subsequent rate case our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital recognition of declining consumption and appropriate recovery of utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files rate cases with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on and of invested capital that are permitted by the puc 

our regulated subsidiaries work with legislatures and pucs to mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag through the adoption of positive regulatory policies these policies include for example infrastructure replacement surcharges that allow rates to change outside the context of a general rate proceeding to reflect on a more timely basis investments to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain high quality reliable service currently pennsylvania illinois mi ssouri indiana new york new jersey and tennessee allow the use of infrastructure surcharges 

forwardlooking test year mechanisms allow us to earn on a more current basis our current or projected usage and costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital some states have permitted use of a fully forecasted test year instead of historical data to set rates examples of these states include illinois kentucky new york tennessee california  pennsylvania and indiana in all states in which we operate on a regulated basis pucs have allowed utilities to update historical data for certain “known and measurable” changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year this allows utilities to take into account more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process the extent to which historical data can be updated will generally vary from state to state 

surcharge mechanisms are also available in a number of states to reflect outside of a general rate proceeding changes in major operating expenses which may be beyond the utility’s control for example new jersey california virginia and illinois have allowed surcharges for purchased water costs california has allowed surcharges for power and certain other costs and new york has allowed annual reconciliations for revenues and expenses such as power fuel chemicals and property taxes 

certain states have approved consolidated rates or singletariff pricing policies consolidated rates or singletariff pricing is the use of a unified rate structure for multiple water systems that are owned and operated by a single utility but may or may not be contigu ous or physically interconnected the singletariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state based on costs that are determined on a statewide or intrastate regional basis thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for us and our customers for states that do not employ singletariffs we may have multiple general rate cases filed at any given point in time examples of states that have adopted a full or partial singletariff pricing policy include 

pennsylvania new jersey missouri west virginia kentucky indiana illinois and iowa therefore of our seven largest states six have some form of singletariff pricing pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater rate structures which results in single tariff pricing among water and wastewater systems 

another mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag is the potential ability in certain circumstances to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is in service instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include pennsylvania kentucky virginia illinois and california in addition some states such as indiana al low the utility to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the puc assesses the prudency of such projects 

in some states the puc has implemented mechanisms to enhance utility revenue stability in light of conservation initiatives decreasing per capita consumption or other factors sometimes referred to as “decoupling” these mechanisms to some extent separate recoverable revenues from volumes of water sold for example the state of california has decoupled revenues from water sold to help achieve the state initiative to reduce water usage by 20 by 2020 this progressive regulation enables utilities to encourage water efficiency as revenues are not tied to sales similarly new york has implemented a surcharge or credit based on the difference between actual net revenues and the revenues allowed in the most recent rate order 

the company pursues these positive regulatory policies as part of our rate and revenue management program to enhance our ability to provide high quality sustainable cost effective service to customers to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments and to ensure positive shortterm liquidity and longterm profitability the ability of the company to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these policies will reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes however the company strives to use these and other regulatory policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater we are also subject to certain regulations regardi ng fire protection services in the areas we serve these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we also are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently the overall trend has been that they have become more stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could i ncrease we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our regulated businesses are subject in the past we have generally been able to recover costs associated with compliance related to environmental health and safety standards but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery 

we maintain an appropriate environmental policy including responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural resources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples from across our water systems are analyzed on a regular basis for material compliance with regulatory requirements across the company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2013 we achieved a score of greater than 99 for drinking water compliance and according to the epa statistics american water’s performance has been far better than the industry average over the last several years in fact in 2013 american water was 20 times better than the industry average for compliance with drinking water quality standards maximum contaminant levels and 150 times better for compliance with drinking water monitoring and reporting requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water the united states epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 6 8 of our 82 surface water plants receiving the program’s “director” award we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 63 american water plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award while 60 have been awarded the “tenyear phase iii” award additionally three plants received the inaugural “fifteenyear phase iii” award in 2013 

safe drinking water act 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing those contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns to date the epa has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water further certain of our water systems are in the process of monitoring for 28 additional contaminants that are not currently regulated to help the epa determine if any of them occur at high enough levels to warrant being regulated there are thousands of other chemical compounds that are not regulated many of which are lacking a testing methodology occurrence data health effects information andor treatment technology 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources the epa also revised the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule in 2007 and congress enacted the reduction of lead in drinking water act on january 4 2011 regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes plumbing fittings or fixtures solder and flux in 2012 the epa finalized revisions to the total coliform rule that were part of the mandate of a federal advisory committee appointed to negotiate the changes most of the anticipated changes to the rule will not be effective until 2016 the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds but we do not anticipate that any of these regulations will require implementation in 2014 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean wat er act pursuant to the npdes program the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems we believe that we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals which generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite dis posal of wastes although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the united states occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see “business—research and development” 

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters these proceedings are described further in the section entitled “item 3—legal proceedings” 

competition 

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct competition in providing services in our existing markets because i we operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an exist ing market creates a barrier to market 

entry our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors when pursuing acquisitions based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environnement american states water co and california water services group 

condemnation 

the potential exists that all or portions of our subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods 







the acquisition consideration related to such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter we believe our operating subsidiaries would be entitled to fair market value for any assets required to be sold and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for suc h assets 

we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business for example condemnation threats have been made over the last several years with respect to the following systems 



 



 



we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses 

our marketbased operations 

in addition to our regulated businesses we operate the following lines of business in our marketbased operations of the lines of business outlined below no single group within our marketbased operations generates in excess of 10 of our aggregate consolidated revenue 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including om and design build and operate “dbo” contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities the food and beverage industry and other customers we typically mak e no longterm capital investment under these contracts with municipalities and other customers instead we perform our services for a fee during the contract term we may make limited short term capital investments under our contracts with the united states military and certain industrial customers our contract operations group generated revenue of 2126 million in 2013 representing 653 of revenue for our marketbased operations 

we are party to more than 70 contracts varying in size and scope across the united states and canada with contracts ranging in terms from one to 50 years included in these contracts are ten 50year contracts including the hill air force base contract that was awarded to us in january 2014 with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems on certain military bases all of our contracts with the us government may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to the standard terms of the us government contract termination provisions we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions 

on december 31 2011 we completed the sale of our applied water management inc group “awm” as noted above this subsidiary is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented therefore all amounts and statistics disclosed for the contract operations group refer only to ongoing operations of the contract operations group 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group through our service line protection program provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial establishments to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking water pipes and clogged or blocked sewer pipes inside and outside their accommodations these repairs are not typically covered by homeowners’ insurance or by their water or sewer service provider 

our linesaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipalities during 2012 we entered into a contract with the new york city water board the “board” a corporate municipal instrumentality of the state of new york to offer our linesaver™ program t o the board’s approximately 650000 homeowners throughout the city’s five boroughs as of december 31 2013 our homeowner services group has approximately 13 million customer contracts in 37 states including the new york city customer contracts 

terratec environmental ltd 

our marketbased operations also includes our biosolids management group terratec which is located in canada and provides environmentally sustainable management and disposal of biosolids and wastewater byproducts 

competition 

we face competition in our marketbased operations from a number of service providers including veolia environnement american states water omi and southwest water particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competiti ve as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as the municipal and industrial fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process 

our homeowner services group faces competition outside our existing footprint primarily from homeserve usa and utility service partners inc 

research and development 

we established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our business our research and development personnel are located in new jersey in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports research through sophisticated testing and analysis since its inception our research and development program has evolved to become a leading waterrelated research program achieving advanc ements in the science of drinking water including sophisticated water testing procedures and desalination technologies 

since the formation of the epa in 1970 we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa has helped us t o achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

in 2013 we spent 29 million on research and development compared to 28 million and 26 million spent in 2012 and 2011 respectively approximately onequarter of our research budget is comprised of competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers 

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical in providing quality and reliable service at reasonable rates in maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

support services 

our american water works service company subsidiary provides shared services and corporate governance that achieve economies of scale through central administration these services are provided predominantly to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services which are provided at cost may include accounting administration business development communications corporate secretarial education and training engineering financial health and safety human resources information systems internal audit legal operations procurement rates security risk management water quality and research and development these arrangements afford our operating companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis we also operate two national customer service centers which are located in alton illinois and pensacola florida 

our security department provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing implementing monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basi s for further capital investment in security for the facility information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs we are in contact with federal state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply 

employee matters 

approximately 50 of our workforce is represented by unions we have 76 collective bargaining agreements in place with 18 different unions representing our unionized employees we have three union contracts beyond expiration that affect approximately 200 employees all of which are actively working under the old agreements during 2014 22 of our local union contracts will expire 

september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement  we implemented our last best and final offer on january 1 2011 in order to provide health care coverage for our employees in accordance with terms of the offer the unions have challenged our right to implement our last best and final offer in this regard following the filing by the utility workers union of america of an unfair labor practice charge the national labor relations board “nlrb” issued a complaint against us in january 2012 claiming that we implemented the last best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the federal mediation and conciliation service a state mediation agency and several state departments of labor we asserted that we did in fact provide sufficient notice 

on october 16 2012 the nlrb administrative law judge hearing the matter ruled that although we did provide sufficient notification to the federal mediation and conciliation service we did not provide notice to state agencies in violation of the national labor relations act the administrative law judge ordered among other things that we cease and desist from implementing the terms of our last best and final offer and make whole all affected employees for losses suffered as a result of our implementation of our last best and final offer the “make whole” order if upheld on appeal would require us to provide backpay plus interest from january 1 2011 through the date of the final determination based on current estimates and assumptions we estimate the cash impact could be in the range of 30 to 35 million per year with the total impact dependent on the length of time the issue remains unresolved in november 2012 we filed an exception to the decision of the administrative law judge in order to obtain a review by the full nrlb we expect to hear from the nrlb in 2014

risk factors 

tableend

we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business 

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation decisions by state pucs and other regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are economically regulated by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses to enable us to finance the addition of new or the replacement of existing water and wastewater infrastructure and to provide us the opportunity to earn what they determine to be an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends upon the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be approved or that any a pproval will be given in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to cover our expenses including purchased water and costs of chemicals fuel and other commodities used in our operations enable us to recover our investment and provide us an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if water usage is less than anticipated in establishing rates as billings to customers are to a considerable extent based on usage in addition to a base rate or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than was estimated in establishing rates 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations compliance with increasingly stringent laws and regulations could impact our operating costs and violations of such laws and regulations could subject the company to substantial liabilities and costs 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include the united states clean water act of 1972 which we refer to as the clean water act and the united states safe drinking water act of 1974 which we refer to as the safe drinking water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations for example recently the monterey county health department environmental health bureau “mchd” notified our subsidiary california american water “cawc” that the mchd had received a complaint filed with the department of toxic substance control regarding arsenic levels and disposal locations of sludge generated from the company’s ambler park and toro water treatment plants prior to may 2013 mchd requested that cawc provide mchd with sludge disposal records analytical results and supporting documentation related to this matter through two separate letters cawc submitted the requested documentation and information to mchd and advised mchd that based on the analysis performed it appears that some of the residual wastes from the two plants as well as cawc’s ryan ranch water treatment plant may have exceeded california hazardous waste soluble threshold limit concentration requirements and therefore should not have not been disposed of at the nonhazardous disposal facilities to which they were transported cawc further advised mchd that in light of the findings cawc modified its 

procedures to insure that wastes sent for disposal are properly characterized and managed cawc similarly reported to the sacramento county department of environmental management that it may have improperly disposed of arsenic residuals from its isleton treatment plant before july 2013 by letter dated november 6 2013 the monterey county district attorney advised cawc that it had received a report from the mchd that cawc had transported and disposed such hazardous wastes in violation of applicable provisions of the california health and safety code and the california business and professions code which subject violators to civil penalties of up to 25000 per violation and up to2500 per violation respectively the district attorney invited cawc to arrange a meeting to discuss the matter prior to taking any enforcement action and a meeting was held on november 20 2013 the district attorney has not indicated whether enforcement action will be taken similarly cawc continues to discuss the matter relating to the isleton treatment plant with the sacramento county department of environmental management which has not indicated whether enforcement action will be taken the company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter 

in addition state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctio ns or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations  these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

limitations on availability of water supplies or restrictions on our use of water supplies as a result of government regulation or action may adversely affect our access to sources of water our ability to supply water to customers or the demand for our water services 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private inter ests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time may adversely impact our water supply supply issues such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 20 2009 order of the california state water resources control board the “2009 order” that our subsidiary cawc significantly decrease its diversion from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule running through december 31 2016 the 2016 deadline we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act we have implemented conservation rates and other programs to address demand and are utilizing aquifer storage and recovery facilities to store winter water for summer use we were hopeful that we could address the water supply issues in a meaningful way through a regional desalination project the “project” that was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cawc however the project was subject to considerable delay and disputes among the parties on july 7 2011 mcwra advised mcwd and cawc that the agreements were void and on january 17 2012 cawc publicly announced that it had withdrawn support of the project finally on july 12 2012 the california public utility commission “cpuc” closed the proceedings relating to the project nevertheless disputes among the parties with respect to the project continued thereafter and while cawc and mcwra have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve their disputes the terms of 

the settlement agreement are largely contingent on approval by the cpuc of the settlement agreement as well as cawcs recovery through rates of its provision to mcwra of 19 million in loan forgiveness and up to approximately 15 million in additional payments moreover cawc’s disputes with mcwd remain unresolved and subject to ongoing litigation although cawc and mcwd currently are subject to an agreement with respect to certain claims by cawc against mcwd that tolls the applicable statute of limitations and a deadline for commencement by cawc of litigation relating to certain of its claims against mcwd following its withdrawal of support for the project cawc filed an application with the cpuc on april 23 2012 for approval of the monterey peninsula water supply project the “new project” the new project involves construction of a desalination plant and related facilities all to be owned by cawc in addition the new project may encompass cawc’s purchase of water from the proposed monterey peninsula groundwater replenishment project a joint project between the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the monterey peninsula water management district “mpwmd” the application also seeks cpuc approval of ratemaking mechanisms designed to enable cawc to recover its costs related to construction and operation of the new project including funding for principal and interest on a state revolving fund loan that cawc believes it is eligible to receive under a july 2012 settlement agreement among cawc and 15 other parties that have intervened in the cpuc proceedings with respect to the new project including several monterey county government entities the parties have agreed to among other things cost caps for the desalination plant and certain pipeline facilities to be constructed by cawc aggregating 2957 million to 3384 million depending on the size of the desalination plant ultimately approved by the cpuc in a separate settlement agreement among most of the same parties the participating parties agreed on sizing of the desalination plant at 96 million gallons per day if the gwr project does not supply water to cawc and if the gwr project supplies water to cawc either 64 million gallons per day or 69 million gallons per day depending on discrete capacities of gwr project water the settlement agreements are subject to the approval of the cpuc and will not take effect unless the cpuc determines they are reasonable within the law and the public interest and until the cpuc certifies an environmental impact report for the proposed new project currently scheduled for the first quarter of 2015 cawc’s ability to move forward on the new project will be subject to extensive administrative review including public hearings before the cpuc and testimony from intervening parties in addition a large number of federal state and local approvals must also be obtained moreover due to delays related to among other things determination of the need for government approval to proceed with certain testing required to enable the preparation of the environmental impact report cawc currently estimates that the earliest date by which the new project could be completed is mid to late 2018 because the projected completion date is beyond the 2016 deadline cawc has commenced discussions with the state water resources control board and other government representatives to extend the 2016 deadline while cawc believes the discussions have been constructive we cannot assure that that the 2016 deadline will be extended we cannot predict the ultimate effect of the events described above on cawc’s efforts to secure alternative sources of water or on cawc’s exposure to liabilities as a result of its ongoing disputes relating to the project or its inability to meet the 2016 deadline under the 2006 order if cawc is unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas if a regional drought were to occur governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system for example as a result of the reduced rain fall and overall dry conditions throughout the state of california cawc has been closely monitoring its owned and purchased water supplies on january 17 2014 the california governor issued a drought declaration asking californians to reduce their water use by 20 at this time cawc is awaiting determination by cpuc staff on an advice letter cawc submitted that would clarify the water conservation and rationing plan for certain districts in cawcs tariffs including a conservation and rationing mechanism for the sacramento district the cpuc suspended the effective date of the advice letter until after cawc holds a public meeting for the sacramento district during a february 2014 meeting between the cpuc staff and representatives from several water utilities including cawc participants noted that the drought may result in utilities opening the catastrophic event memorandum accounts in all districts which affords the opportunity to seek recovery of extraordinary expenditures related to the drought following drought conditions water demand may not return to predrought levels even after restrictions are lifted decreased use of water services resulting from any of these events may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

 

service disruptions caused by severe weather conditions may disrupt our operations and economic conditions may reduce the demand for water services either of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas these include winter storms and freezing conditions high wind conditions tornados earthquakes coastal and intercoastal floods or high water conditions including those in or near designated flood plains hurricanes and severe electrical storms these weather events may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage in the third quarter of 2011 our new jersey and pennsylvania subsidiaries experienced service interruptions in certain of our operating areas and in some cases a loss in customers as a result of the extreme weather including hurricane irene and other severe storms in the northeast in october 2012 our east coast subsidiaries were affected by hurricane sandy the most significant impact to our business was caused by the widespread power outages caused by the storm’s heavy winds rain and snow 

in addition adverse economic conditions can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage in more severe circumstances the decline i n usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection or treatment systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages which may not be recove rable in rates this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition moreover if we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow our losses might not be covered by insurance and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

the current regulatory rate setting structure may result in a significant delay or “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can address these events through the rate case application process our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business 

there is typically a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a mini mum base rate thus we may experience a regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

the company endeavors to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing positive regulatory policies for example seven state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expe nditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond the utility’s control such as purchased water costs or property or other taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates closer to the time costs have been incurred than would be the case under the rate case application process while these programs have been a positive development and we continue to work for expansion of programs to mitigate regulatory lag some state pucs have not approved such programs and there is no assurance that any puc will adopt any of them in the future or that existing programs will continue in their current form or at all in the future furthermore no state has adopted surcharge programs that include all elements of cost that may change between general rate proceedings although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is very capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2013 we invested 9 50 million in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems could increase in the future we fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt and equity securities we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all 

in addition we could be limited in our ability to both pursue growth and pay dividends in line with our dividend policy in particular the use of cash to pay dividends could affect our ability to make large acquisitions or pursue other growth opportunities that require cash investments in amounts greater than our available cash and external financing resources in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions including tuckin acquisitions principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we expect that we will need additional financing however we intend to retain sufficient cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 

if we do not obtain sufficient capital we may be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment realize our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and successfully expand the rate base upon which we are able to earn future returns on our investment and a return of our invest ment even if we have adequate resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital expenditures on time as a result of construction delays or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our water service and our revenues 

demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other outside water use throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months demand tends to vary with temperature  rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans these assets are subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rat es a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets can increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if future returns on these assets are insufficient to offset the decline in value additionally the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates if interest rates decrease our liabilities would increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics such as increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of our obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates and our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2013 our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 58745 million and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 















in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new debt securities in the capital markets moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities a nd sinking fund payments in 2014 and 2015 are 142 million and 607 million respectively we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control if we do not have su fficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 

contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries to civil or criminal enforcement actions private litigation and cleanup obligations 

our water supplies into our treatment plants or the supplies then delivered into our distribution system are subject to contamination including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether and possible terrorist attacks if one of our water supplies is contaminated depending on the nature of the contamination we may have to either 1  interrupt the use of that water supply and locate an adequate supply of water from another water source including in some cases through the purchase of water from a thirdparty supplier or 2 continue the water supply under a “do not use” protective order that allows for continuation of basic sanitation and essential fire protection if service is disrupted and we are unable to access a substitute water supply in a costeffective manner our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods we might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates or recovery of these costs may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort or other lawsuits criminal enforcement actions contractual obligations or other consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 

 

in this regard on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances used for processing coal 4methylcyclohexane methanol or mchm and pph a mix of polyglocol ethers into the elk river near the west virginiaamerican water company “wvawc” treatment plant intake in charleston wes t virginia after having been alerted to the leak of mchm by the west virginia department of environmental protection “dep” freedom industries first notified dep on january 21 2014 that pph was also leaked wvawc took immediate steps to gather more information about mchm augment its treatment process as a precaution and begin consultations with federal state and local public health officials as soon as possible after it was determined that the augmented treatment process would not fully remove the mchm a joint decision was reached in consultation with the west virginia bureau for public health to issue a “do not use” order to approximately 300000 people in parts of nine west virginia counties the order addressed the use of water for drinking cooking washing and bathing but did not affect continued use of water for sanitation and fire protection over the next several days wvawc and an interagency team of state and federal officials engaged in extensive sampling and testing to determine if levels of mchm were below one part per million 1 ppm a level that the us centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and us environmental protection agency indicated would be protective of public health beginning on january 13 2014 based on the results of the continued testing the do not use order was lifted in stages to help ensure the water system was not overwhelmed by excessive demand which could have caused additional water quality and service issues by january 18 2014 none of wvawc’s customers were subject to the do not use order although cdc guidance suggesting that pregnant women avoid consuming the water until the chemicals are at a nondetectable level remained in place in addition based on reanalysis of previously saved samples pph was no longer detected at any sampling locations as of january 18 2014 on february 21 2014 wvawc announced that all points of testing throughout its water distribution system indicated that levels of mchm are below 10 parts per billion 10 ppb the interagency team established 10 ppb as the “nondetect” level of mchm in the water distribution system based on the measurement capabilities of the multiple laboratories used wvawc is continuing sampling and testing in an effort to pinpoint its flushing activities and address odor issues 

wvawc has and may continue to incur significant costs in responding to this incident and may not be able to recover such costs through rates or from insurers even if recovery is possible it may not occur in a timely manner moreover government investigations relating to the freedom industries spill have been initiated state and federal legislatures have begun considering changes to existing laws and more than 50 lawsuits have been filed to date against wv awc and in a few cases the company or other company affiliates freedom industries which is now in bankruptcy is also named in many of the complaints in addition a purported stockholder has made a demand that the companys board of directors take action to remedy alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by all of the members of the board and another company officer in connection with this matter which is being referred to the board of directors for its consideration while the company and wvawc believe that wvawc has responded appropriately to and 

has no responsibility for the freedom industries spill and the company and wvawc believe they and other company affiliates have valid meritorius defenses to the lawsuits wvawc will incur substantial defense costs moreover an adverse outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation wvawc and the company are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing government investigations or any legislative initiatives that might impact water utility operations 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

approximately 50 of our workforce is represented by unions we have 76 collective bargaining agreements in place with 18 different unions representing our unionized employees we might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are fair to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity in september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement we implemented our “last best and final” offer on january 1 2011 in order to provide health care coverage for our employees in accordance with the terms of the offer the unions have challenged our right to implement our last best and final offer in this regard following the filing by the utility workers union of america of an unfair labor practice charge the national labor relations board “nlrb” issued a complaint against us in january 2012 claiming that we implemented the last best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the federal mediation and conciliation service a state mediation agency and several state departments of labor we have asserted that we did in fact provide sufficient notice on october 16 2012 the nlrb administrative law judge hearing the matter ruled that although we did provide sufficient notification to the federal mediation and conciliation service we did not provide notice to state agencies in violation of the national labor relations act the administrative law judge ordered among other things that we cease and desist from implementing the terms of our last best and final offer and make whole all affected employees for losses suffered as a result of our implementation of our last best and final offer the “make whole” order if upheld on appeal would require us to provide backpay plus interest from january 1 2011 through the date of the final determination by the nlrb based on current estimates and assumptions we estimate the cash impact could be in the range of 35 to 45 million per year with the total impact dependent on the length of time the issue remains unresolved in november 2012 we filed an exception to the decision of the administrative law judge in order to obtain a review by the full nlrb although no work stoppages have occurred with respect to the expired contracts described above we cannot provide assurance that a work stoppage or strike will not occur while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur we cannot assure that a strike or work stoppage would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we own 87 dams a failure of any of those dams could result in personal injury and downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs can be and has been material we might not be able to recover such costs through rates the inability to recover these higher costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity the federal and state agencies tha t regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and storage systems located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments 

our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations we rely on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external source of liquidity is our revolving credit facility we regularly use our commercial paper program as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we obtain in the commercial paper market however disruptions in the ca pital markets could limit our ability to access capital while our credit facility lending banks have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs particularly if borrowings through the commercial paper market are unavailable we maintain a 125 billion revolving credit facility under the terms of our revolving credit facility commitments which total 118 billion mature in october 2018 our inability to maintain renew or replace these commitments could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and  416 million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility as of february 21 2014 awcc had 6299 million of outstanding commercial paper as of february 21 2014 we cannot assure that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital and credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures 

any impediments to our access to the capital markets failure of our lenders to meet their commitments increased interest expense or cash conservation measures resulting from financial market disruptions or otherwise could adversely affect our business financial con dition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also r esult in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity including the following 

























 

an important part of our growth strategy is the acquisition of water and wastewater systems any future acquisitions we undertake may involve risks further competition for acquisition opportunities from other regulated utilities governmental entities and strategic and financial buyers may hinder our ability to grow our business 

 

an important element of our growth strategy is the acquisition and integration of water and wastewater systems in order to broaden our current and move into new service areas we will not be able to acquire other businesses if we cannot identify suitable acquisition opportunities or reach mutually agreeable terms with acquisition candidates it is our int ent when practical to integrate any businesses we acquire with our existing operations the negotiation of potential acquisitions as well as the integration of acquired businesses could require us to incur significant costs and cause diversion of our management’s time and resources future acquisitions by us could result in 

  



  



  



  



  



  



  



  



some or all of these items could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to finance our business pay dividends and to comply with regulatory requirements the businesses we acquire in the future may not achieve sales and profitability that would justify our investment and any difficulties we encounter in the integration process including in the integration of processes necessary for internal control and financial reporting could interfere with our operations reduce our operating margins and adversely affect our internal controls we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities and strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities if consolidation becomes more prevalent in the water and wastewater industries and competition for acquisitions increases the prices for suitable acquisition candidates may increase to unacceptable levels and limit our ability to grow through acquisitions in addition our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities near our existing operations thereby preventing us from acquiring them competing governmental entities utilities environmental or social activist groups and strategic and financial buyers have challenged and may in the future challenge our efforts to acquire new companies andor service territories our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new companies andor service territories with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations any of these risks may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include substantial goodwill at december 31 2013 our goodwill totaled 12078 million the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 and the acquisition of e’tow n corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past in the aggregate goodwill impairment charges including those recognized in our discontinued operations taken in each year from 2006 through 2009 totaled approximately 193 billion and reduced net income by approximately 191 billion 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in 

valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in our market price consistent with our peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain should a municipality or oth er government subdivision seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain we may resist the acquisition for example condemnation threats have been made over the last several years with respect to the following systems 



 





contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated business’s management from the operation of its business moreover our efforts to resist the acquisition may not be successful 

if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges 

we rely on our information technology “it” systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

 

our it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of opera tions we depend on our it systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections our it systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers while we recently completed the business transformation implementation for our erp eam and cis systems a number of our mission and business critical it systems are older such as our scada supervisory control and data acquisition system although we do not believe that our it systems are at a materially greater risk of cyber security incidents than other similar organizations our it systems remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from 













these events may result in physical andor electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and other adverse consequences in addition the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us 

in addition we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate a t our current level of efficiency 

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2013 we had us federal and state net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 11821 million and 6280 million respectively our federal nol carryforwards begin to expire in 2028 and our state nol carryforwards will expire between 2014 and 2033 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate suf ficient taxable income moreover because our previous owner’s divestiture of its stock was considered an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code the amount of nol carryforwards that may be utilized in any year is limited our management believes the federal nol carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and therefore currently require no valuation allowance at december 31 2013 1306 million of the state nol carryforwards have been offset by a valuation allowance because the company does not believe these nols will more likely than not be realized in the future and we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our nols the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income 

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover changes in income tax laws the economy and general business environment could affect the future utilization of the nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be mater ially adversely affected 

our marketbased operations through american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients who may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased operations do not satisfy certain obligations 

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased operations including financial guarantees or deposits in the event our marketbased operations fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

at december 31 2013 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 29160 million and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased operations grow the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 

our marketbased operations’ longterm contracts with the department of defense may be terminated for the convenience of the us government and are subject to periodic contract price redetermination 

all of our contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to maintain those systems which may negatively affect us as the operators of the systems 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner to undertake capital improvements in some cases we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violati ons and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner 

our marketbased operations are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received 

some of our marketbased operations enter into longterm contracts pursuant to which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee our marketbased operations are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party in addition directly or through our marketbased subsidiaries we often guarantee our marketbased operations’ obligations under those contracts losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

our inability to efficiently optimize and stabilize our recently implemented business transformation project could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

over the past several years we have implemented a “business transformation” project which is intended to improve our business processes and upgrade our legacy core information technology systems this multiyear enterprisewide initiative supports our broader strategic initiatives the project is intended to optimize workflow thro ughout our field operations improve our backoffice operations and enhance our customer service capabilities the scale and costs associated with the business transformation project were significant any technical or other difficulties in optimizing and stabilizing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting in august 2012 our new business systems associated with phase i of our business transformation project became operational phase i consisted of the rollout of the enterprise resource planning systems “erp” which encompass applications that handle human resources finance and supply chainprocurement management activities in the second quarter of 2013 we implemented phase ii of our business transformation project in a number of our regulated subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2013 phase ii of our business transformation project was implemented in our remaining regulated subsidiaries phase ii consisted of the rollout of a new enterprise asset management system which manages an asset’s lifecycle and a customer information system which contains all billing and collections data pertaining to american water’s customers for our regulated segment although efforts have been made to minimize any adverse impact on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated 

as we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project 

we operate numerous information technology systems that have varying degrees of integration sometimes leading to inefficiencies therefore delays in stabilization and optimization of the business transformation project will also delay cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the project we may also exp erience difficulties consolidating our current systems moving to a common set of operational processes and implementing a successful change management process these difficulties may impact our ability to meet customer needs efficiently any such delays or difficulties may have a material and adverse impact on our business client relationships and financial results

alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

 

in 1995 the california water resources control board the water resources control board issued an administrative order the “1995 order” to californiaamerican water company “cawc” requiring cawc to implement an alternative water supply in lieu of diversions from the carmel river the water resources control board held administrative hearings in the summer of 2008 to address claims that cawc has exceeded its water diversion rights in the carmel river and has not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by the 1995 order the water resources control board adopted a cease and desist order applicable to cawc on october 20 2009 the “2009 order” the 2009 order finds that cawc has not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river as required by the 1995 order the 2009 order requires among other things that cawc significantly decrease its yearly diversions from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule running from the date the 2009 order was adopted until december 31 2016 at which point all unpermitted diversions must end failure to effect the decrease in diversions mandated by the 2009 order could result in substantial penalties we can provide no assurances that cawc will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to us as noted below cawc does not expect to have sufficient alternative sources of water available by the december 31 2016 deadline and has begun discussions with the water resources control board to extend the deadline 

on december 2 2010 the california public utilities commission “cpuc” approved the regional desalination project the “project” involving the construction of a desalination facility on the california central coast north of monterey the project was to be implemented thr ough a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cawc the desalination facility was to be constructed and owned by mcwd and mcwra was to construct the wells that were to supply water to the desalination facility the project was intended among other things to fulfill cawc’s obligations under the 1995 order in addition to other obligations 

the project was subject to delay due to among other things funding delays and investigations and inquiries initiated by public authorities relating to an alleged conflict of interest concerning a former member of the mcwra board of directors the “former director” the f ormer director was paid for consulting work by a contractor to mcwd while serving on the mcwra board of directors the contractor subsequently was retained as project manager for the project on november 15 2011 the monterey county district attorney charged the former director with two felony counts of conflict of interest relating to the project as well as additional felony and misdemeanor counts for other activities 

on july 7 2011 mcwra advised mcwd and cawc that the agreements were void as a result of the conduct of the former director subsequently on august 12 2011 cawc advised mcwd and mcwra that they have defaulted in performance of certain financing obligations under the water purchase agreement by letter delivered to mcwd and mcwra on s eptember 28 2011 cawc terminated the agreements based on mcwra’s repudiation of the agreements in other communications among the parties each of mcwd and mcwra have stated that it complied with the financing obligations and mcwd further responded that among other things cawc did not comply on a timely basis with an obligation under the water purchase agreement that cawc provide a letter of credit mcwd also asserted that the agreements remain in effect on january 17 2012 following unsuccessful mediation efforts among the parties cawc publicly announced that it had withdrawn support of the project 

disputes among the parties with respect to the project continued thereafter in public filings before the cpuc mcwd asserted among other things that the cpuc should require cawc to reimburse mcwd for all costs expended by mcwd in connection with the project mcwra asserted that it was entitled to reimbursement of all costs or expenses relating to the project including enumerated expenses under the w pa each of mcwd and mcwra also claimed entitlement to forgiveness of the indebtedness to cawc that it incurred in connection with the project in response cawc challenged mcwd’s claim that it is entitled to reimbursement for certain purported litigation expenses and has stated generally that in light of the failure of mcwd and mcwra to fulfill their contractual obligations under the water purchase agreement their entitlement to reimbursement is unclear on july 12 2012 the cpuc closed the proceedings relating to the project and stated that it would examine the recoverability of costs related to the project in other proceedings cawc plans to file a new application seeking recovery of legal costs relating to the project after any pending legal disputes are resolved 

on september 17 2012 cawc and mcwra entered into a tolling and standstill agreement whereby each party agreed to toll the statute of limitations on any claims either party may have against the other with respect to the project and agreed not to commence litigation against the other while the agreement is in effect in december 2012 cawc mcwra and the county of monterey entered into a settlement agreement under which cawc will forgive approximately 19 million previously loaned by cawc to mcwra in connection with the project and cawc will make additional payments of up to approximately 15 million to mcwra approximately half of which will be paid directly to mcwra the remaining amount will be placed in an escrow account to pay claims of consultants and contractors against mcwra relating to the project the settlement agreement the debt forgiveness and the additional payments are conditioned on cpuc approval including approval of cawc rate recovery of the debt forgiveness and the additional payments the settlement agreement does not affect a civil proceeding filed by cawc for declaratory relief relating to the validity of the agreements which is described below on may 24 2013 cawc filed an application with the cpuc for approval of the settlement agreement and rate recovery on cawc’s debt forgiveness and additional payments to mcwra under the settlement agreement the application is pending 

cawc sought to enter into an agreement with mcwd whereby each party would agree to toll the statute of limitations on any claims either party may have against the other with respect to the project and agree not to commence litigation against the other but mcwd initially refused to do so therefore on september 18 2012 cawc filed a formal c laim with the mcwd board seeking monetary damages against mcwd in its claim cawc alleges that the project was terminated due to among other things mcwd’s breach of one of the agreements by failing to use its best efforts to obtain project financing that mcwd has failed to repay approximately 6 million loaned by cawc to mcwd in connection with the project and that cawc made substantial expenditures in connection with the project which it is entitled to recover from mcwd cawc has claimed damages potentially in excess of 20 million on november 2 2012 mcwd provided notice that the board of mcwd rejected cawc’s claims for damages cawc had six months from such date to file a court action on this claim but prior to the expiration of the six month period cawc and mcwd entered into a tolling agreement which as extended by subsequent agreement toll applicable statutes of limitations and the deadline for commencement of litigation regarding cawc’s claims until march 1 2014 

on october 4 2012 cawc filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the monterey county superior court against mcwra and mcwd seeking a determination by the court as to whether the agreements are void as a result of the former director’s alleged conflict of interest or remaine d valid on november 21 2012 mcwd filed an answer to cawc’s complaint a motion to change venue and a crosscomplaint for declaratory relief mcwd’s crosscomplaint seeks a judicial declaration that any challenge to the validity of the agreements are timebarred or barred by the california public utilities code mcwra filed its answer to cawc’s crosscomplaint on december 7 2012 alleging among other things that this action must be stayed pending conclusion of the criminal proceeding relating to the alleged conflict of interest by the former director after cawc indicated that it did not object to a change of venue the monterey county superior court approved mcwd’s motion to transfer the case to san francisco county superior court and the transfer was accepted by the san francisco county superior court on january 30 2013 on october 9 2013 mcwd filed a motion for summary judgment and summary adjudication seeking a determination that the agreements are valid in its motion mcwd asserts that the court does not have jurisdiction to determine the validity of the agreements on the basis that the agreements were approved by final decisions of the cpuc and under the california public utilities code superior courts are prohibited from exercising jurisdiction to decide matters that would interfere with the cpuc’s policies or performance of its duties mcwd also argued that the action was barred by 60day statutes of limitations applicable to certain contracts entered into by the mcwd and to certain contracts entered into by the mcwra cawc filed responsive pleadings challenging the motion on 

february 212014 the court conducted a hearing on the motion and ordered the parties to submit additional briefs by february 21 2014 subject to the courts decision on the motion a trial has been scheduled to commence on march 24 2014 

on april 23 2012 cawc filed an application with the cpuc for approval of the monterey peninsula water supply project the “new project” the new project involves construction of a desalination plant and related facilities all to be owned by cawc in addition the new project may encompass cawc’s purchase of water from the proposed monterey peninsula groundwater replenishment project the “gwr project” a joint project betwee n the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the monterey peninsula water management district “mpwmd” the new project also would involve aquifer storage and recovery through an already established aquifer storage and recovery program between cawc and the mpwmd cawc stated in the application that it anticipates based on discussions with the water resources control board that it is eligible for a state revolving fund loan for the new project the application also seeks cpuc approval of ratemaking mechanisms designed to enable cawc to recover its costs related to construction and operation of the new project including funding for principal and interest on the state revolving fund loan 

on july 31 2013 cawc entered into a settlement agreement with 15 other parties that have intervened in the cpuc proceedings with respect to the new project including several monterey county government entities the division of ratepayer advocates of the cpuc and several interest groups under the settleme nt agreement the parties have agreed on several matters relating to the new project including among other things the following cost caps for the desalination plant and certain pipeline facilities to be constructed by cawc aggregating 2957 million to 3384 million depending on the size of the desalination plant ultimately approved by the cpuc the process for recovery of project costs including cost recovery for capital cawc agreed to maintain a fixed equity investment in the new project equal to approximately 27 of total costs related to the desalination plant and certain other facilities to be constructed by cawc and operation and maintenance costs procedures by which cawc may seek recovery for reasonable and prudent costs above the caps recommended criteria the cpuc should use to determine whether cawc should build a smaller desalination plant to accommodate cawc’s purchase of water from the gwr project the development of a hydrogeologic study work plan to determine the extent if any to which the proposed new project may adversely affect the salinas river groundwater basin and the water supply contingency measures if the initially proposed intake wells brine discharge mechanisms and plant location are infeasible and financing mechanisms for the new project in a separate settlement agreement among most of the same parties the participating parties agreed on sizing of the desalination plant at 96 million gallons per day if the gwr project does not supply water to cawc and if the gwr project supplies water to cawc either 64 million gallons per day or 69 million gallons per day depending on discrete capacities of gwr project water 

the settlement agreements are subject to the approval of the cpuc and will not take effect unless the cpuc determines they are reasonable within the law and the public interest and until the cpuc certifies an environmental impact report for the proposed new project which currently is expected to be issued in the first quarter of 2015 

moreover cawc’s ability to move forward on the new project is subject to extensive administrative review by the cpuc review by other government agencies of necessary permit applications and intervention from other parties including some that are not participants in the settlement agreements in addition there have been delays in the initial timetable for preparation of the environmental impact report due to among other things uncertainties regarding timing of government approval of various required permits as a result cawc estimates that the earliest date by which the new project could be completed is mid to late 2018 we cannot assure that cawc’s application for the new project will be approved or that the new project will be completed on a timely basis if ever 

because the projected completion date of the new project is beyond the december 31 2016 deadline for cawc to terminate unpermitted diversions from the carmel river cawc has commenced discussions with the water resources control board and other government representatives to extend the december 2016 deadline while cawc believes the discussions have been constructive we cannot assume that the deadline will be extended 

water treatment residuals disposal matters 

cawc operates six water treatment plants in california that remove excess arsenic from raw water in order to achieve compliance with applicable drinking water standards the water treatment plants are located in monterey ambler ryan ranch toro sacramento isleton walnut grove and sonoma lar kfield counties the removal process generates a waste stream “residuals” that contains among other things low levels of the arsenic removed from the raw water if arsenic levels in solid waste exceed certain specified concentrations the waste should be characterized as “hazardous” under the california hazardous waste control act “hwca” hazardous waste is subject to different transportation and disposal requirements than nonhazardous waste for purposes of classifying a waste as hazardous california uses a threshold for arsenic that is significantly lower than the threshold specified by the united states environmental protection agency in april 2013 the monterey county health department environmental health department “mchd” notified cawc that the mchd received a complaint filed with the california department of toxic substance control regarding arsenic levels and disposal locations of sludge generated from cawc’s ambler park and toro water treatment plants prior to may 2013 mchd requested that cawc provide mchd with sludge disposal records analytical results and supporting documentation related to this matter cawc submitted the requested information to mchd and advised mchd that based on the analysis performed it appears that some of the residual wastes from the ambler park and toro plants as well as a third plant ryan ranch may have exceeded california hazardous waste soluble threshold limit concentration requirements and should 

therefore have not been disposed of at the nonhazardous waste disposal facilities to which they were transported cawc further advised mchd that in light of the findings cawc modified its procedures to insure that wastes transported for disposal are properly characterized and managed cawc similarly determined and selfreported to the sacramento county environmental management department “scemd” that it may have improperly disposed of arsenic residuals from its isleton treatment plant before july 2013 

 

by letter dated november 6 2013 the monterey county district attorney advised cawc that it had received a report from the mchd that cawc had transported and disposed such hazardous wastes in violation of applicable provisions of the california health and safety code and the california business and profess ions code violators of the health and safety code and the business and professions code are subject to liabilities of 25000 per violation and 2500 per violation respectively on november 20 2013 cawc met with the district attorney to discuss the matter the district attorney has not indicated whether enforcement action will be taken similarly cawc continues to discuss the matter related to the isleton treatment palnt with the scemd which also has not indicated whether enforcement action will be taken the company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter 

west virginia elk river chemical spill 

 

on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances used for processing coal 4methylcyclohexane methanol or mchm and pph a mix of polyglocol ethers into the elk river near the west virginiaamerican water company wvawc treatment plant intake in charleston west virginia after having been alerted to the leak of mchm by the west virginia departme nt of environmental protection “dep” freedom industries first notified dep on january 21 2014 that pph was also leaked wvawc took immediate steps to gather more information about mchm augment its treatment process as a precaution and begin consultations with federal state and local public health officials as soon as possible after it was determined that the augmented treatment process would not fully remove the mchm a joint decision was reached in consultation with the west virginia bureau for public health to issue a “do not use” order to approximately 300000 people in parts of nine west virginia counties the order addressed the use of water for drinking cooking washing and bathing but did not affect continued use of water for sanitation and fire protection over the next several days wvawc and an interagency team of state and federal officials engaged in extensive sampling and testing to determine if levels of mchm were below one part per million 1 ppm a level that the us centers for disease control and prevention “cdc” and us environmental protection agency indicated would be protective of public health beginning on january 13 2014 based on the results of the continued testing the do not use order was lifted in stages to help ensure the water system was not overwhelmed by excessive demand which could have caused additional water quality and service issues by january 18 2014 none of wvawc’s customers were subject to the do not use order although cdc guidance suggesting that pregnant women avoid consuming the water until the chemicals are at nondetectable levels remained in place in addition based on reanalysis of previously saved samples pph was no longer detected at any sampling locations as of january 18 2014 on february 21 2014 wvawc announced that all points of testing throughout its water distribution system indicated that levels of mchm are below 10 parts per billion 10 ppb the interagency team established 10 ppb as the “nondetect” level of mchm in the water distribution system based on the measurement capabilities of the multiple laboratories used wvawc is continuing sampling and testing in an effort to pinpoint its flushing activities and address odor issues 

to date an aggregate of 50 lawsuits have been filed against wvawc with respect to this matter in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia and west virginia circuit courts in kanawha boone and putman counties many of these lawsuits also name freedom industries  which is now in bankruptcy and a few also name the company or other company affiliates the plaintiffs include local businesses individuals and a putnam county municipality the complaints generally seek class action status raise claims based on a variety of tort statutory and contract theories and seek a combination of compensatory damages punitive damages medical monitoring and other equitable relief frequently cited causes of action include negligence nuisance trespass strict liability and violation of the west virginia consumer credit and protection act additionally investigations with respect to the matter have been initiated by the chemical safety board the us attorney’s office for the southern district of west virginia the west virginia attorney general and other governmental entities 

the company and wvawc believe that wvawc has responded appropriately to and has no responsibility for the freedom industries spill and the company wvawc and other companyaffiliated entities named in any of the lawsuits have valid meritorious defenses to the lawsuits the company wvawc and the other company affiliates intend to vigorously contest the lawsuits nevertheless an adverse outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation moreover wvawc and the company are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing government investigations or any legislative initiatives that might affect water utility operations 

periodically the company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations however litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance it is possible that some litigation and other proce edings could be decided unfavorably to us and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

in 2013 we continued the execution of our strategic goals our commitment to operational excellence led to continued improvement in our regulated operating efficiency improved performance of our marketbased operations and enabled us to provide increased value to our customers and investors during the year we focused on addressing regulatory lag made more efficient use of capital and improved our regulated operation and maintenance “om” efficiency ratio also in 2013 we expanded both our regulated businesses and marketbased operations 

2013 financial results 

for the year ended december 31 2013 we continued to increase our net income while continuing to make significant capital investment in our infrastructure and implementing operational efficiency improvements necessary to offset increases in depreciation and general taxes aided by rate increases lower om and despite the unfavorable weather conditions in the second and third quarters of 2013 we generated 29019 million in total operating revenue and 3693 million in net income or diluted earnings per share “eps” of 206 compared to total operating revenue of 28769 million and 3581 million in net income in 2012 or diluted eps of 201 net income from continuing operations was 3693 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to net income from continuing operations of 3743 million for the year ended december 31 2012 net income and net income from continuing operations for 2013 included an aftertax charge of 248 million or diluted eps of 014 that was recorded in the fourth quarter to effect a tender offer that we announced in september of 2013 diluted earnings from continuing operations per average common share was 206 for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 211 for year ended december 31 2012

addressing regulatory lag 

in 2013 we received authorizations for additional annualized revenues from general rate cases totaling  414 million during 2013 rate cases were approved for our kentucky west virginia and pennsylvania subsidiaries also in 2013 we were granted 361 million in additional annualized revenues assuming constant sales volume from infrastructure charges in several of our states 

on april 30 2013 we filed a general rate case in our iowa subsidiary requesting additional annualized revenues of 64 million on may 10 2013 interim rates of 27 million in annualized revenues were approved and put into effect as interim rates under bond and subject to refund on february 4 2014 the iowa utilities board iub held a verbal decision meeting that would allow our iowa subsidiary a permanent annual base ra te increase of 39 million the rate change would not become the final and binding decision of the iub until its written decision is issued on or before february 28 2014 the iub does have the discretion to alter or reverse its position on the verbal decision in the final written order thus the permanent annual base rate increase of 39 million may be adjusted if the verbal iub decision is confirmed by final written order after taking into account the interim increase of 27 million such an award would result in an additional 12 million over revenue generated by interim rates 

on january 24 2014 we filed a general rate case in indiana requesting additional annualized revenues of 196 million the rate case filing is using a fully forecasted test year for the first time 

on january 1 2014 additional annualized revenues of 09 million 101 million and 21 million resulting from infrastructure charges in our new york new jersey and illinois subsidiaries became effective on january 17 2014 and january 31 2013 we filed for additional annualized revenue of 07 million and 02 million respectively from infrastructure charges in our new york subsidiary on february 25 2014 our missouri subsidiary filed for additional revenues from infrastructure charges in the amount of 31 million 

other regulatory activities occurring in 2013 that allow us to address regulatory lag include our tennessee subsidiary which on october 4 2013 filed for approval of a qualified infrastructure investment program rider an economic development investment rider and a safety and environmental compliance rider totaling 05 million our tennessee subsidiary is also filing for approval of a production costs and other passthroughs mechanism which cover over or under collection of authorized expenses for purchased power chemicals waste disposal purchased water including wheeling charges and the tennessee regulatory authority inspection fee this petition is pending regulatory approval our missouri subsidiary proposed a rule addressing an environmental cost adjustment mechanism to pass through expenses and capital costs of mandated environmental compliance measures by a utility the rulemaking was unanimously approved by the public service commission on april 4 2013 it was adopted on january 3 2014 and will become effective 30 days after publication in the code of state regulations 

as of february 25  2014 we are awaiting final orders in three states requesting additional annualized revenue of approximately 584 million 

continuing improvement in om efficiency ratio for our regulated businesses 

we continued to improve on our om e fficiency ratio during 2013 our om efficiency ratio was 387 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to 401 and 424 for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively our om efficiency ratio a nongaap measure is defined as our regulated operation and maintenance expense divided by regulated operating revenues where both om expense and operating revenues are adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense we also exclude from the om expense the allocable portion of nonom support services cost mainly depreciation and general taxes that are reflected in the regulated businesses segment as om costs but for consolidated financial reporting purposes are categorized within other lines in the statement of operations management believes that this calculation better reflects the regulated businesses segment’s om efficiency ratio we evaluate our operating performance using this measure as it is the primary measure of the efficiency of our regulated operations this information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance om efficiency ratio is not a measure defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating 

measures or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report the following table provides a reconciliation between operation and maintenance expense and operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap and to those amounts utilized in the calculation of our om efficiency ratio for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011

making efficient use of capital 

we invested approximately 950 million and 983 million in companyfunded capital improvements in 2013 and 2012 respectively these capital investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations renew aging treatment and network assets provide capacity for new growth and ensure system reliability security and quality of service the need for continuous investment presents a challenge due to the potential for regulatory lag or the delay in recovering our operating expenses and earning an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and obtaining a return of our invested capital in conjunction with our capital investment program management continued its focus on reducing regulatory lag during 2013 

in may 2013 we implemented the first wave of phase ii of our business transformation project in certain of our regulated subsidiaries in october 2013 we implemented phase ii in our remaining regulated subsidiaries phase ii consisted of the rollout of a new enterprise asset management system which will manage an asset’s lifecycle and a customer information system which will contain all billing and data pertaining to american water’s customers for our regulated segment with the final implementation of phase ii in october 2013 our business transformation project was substantially complete at december 31 2013 through december 31 2013 we have spent 3228 million including afudc on this business transformation project with 658 million of that amount spent in 2013 

expanding markets and developing new offerings 

during 2013 our regulated business completed the purchase of ten water systems and five wastewater systems these acquisitions added approximately 300 00 customers to our regulated operations the largest of these acquisitions was the acquisition of dale service corporation “dale” by our virginia subsidiary on november 14 2013 the service area of dale overlapped with virginia american water’s existing water service in prince william county with the dale acquisition we added approximately 20100 wastewater customers to our existing customer base also during 2013 our marketbased operations through our homeowner services group “hos” expanded its water and sewer line protection programs into 10 additional states and washington dc 

in january 2014 our military services group part of our contract operations group within the marketbased operations was awarded a contract for ownership operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at hill ai r force base in utah according to the agreement the award is estimated at approximately 288 million over a 50year period we have begun the transition of the facility which will be fully transitioned to us by september 1 2014 when we will commence our operations of the facility under the contract also in january 2014 hos announced that it has expanded its water line and sewer line protection programs into three additional states maine minnesota and oklahoma 

 

other matters 

west virginia event 

on january 9 2014 a chemical storage tank owned by freedom industries inc leaked two substances used for processing coal 4methylcyclohexane methanol or mchm and pph a mix of polyglycol ethers into the elk river near the west virginiaamerican water company wvawc treatment plant in charleston west virginia after having been alerted to the leak by the dep w vawc took immediate steps to gather more information about the chemical augment its treatment as a precaution and begin consultations with federal state and local public health officials as soon as possible after it was determined that the augmented treatment process would not fully remove the chemical a joint decision was reached in consultation with the west virginia bureau for public health to issue a “do not use” order to approximately 300000 people in parts of nine west virginia counties the order addressed the use of water for drinking cooking washing and bathing but did not affect continued use of water for sanitation and fire protection over the next several days wvawc and an interagency team of state and federal officials engaged in extensive testing to determine if levels of mchm were below one part per million 1 ppm a level that the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and us environmental protection agency indicated would be protective of public health based on the results of continued testing the do not use order was lifted in stages beginning on january 13 2014 by january 18th none of wvawc’s customers were subject to the do not use order although cdc guidance suggesting that pregnant women avoid consuming the water until the chemicals are at nondetectable levels remained in place in addition based on reanalysis of previously saved samples pph was no longer detected at any sampling locations as of january 18 2014 on february 21 2014 wvawc announced that all points of testing throughout its water distribution system indicated that levels of mchm are below 10 parts per billion 10 ppb the interagency team established 10 ppb as the “nondetect” level of mchm in the water distribution system based on the measurement capabilities of the multiple laboratories used wvawc is continuing sampling and testing in an effort to pinpoint its flushing activities and address odor issues 

to date an aggregate of 50 lawsuits have been filed against wvawc with respect to this matter in the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia and west virginia circuit courts in kanawha boone and putman counties many of which also name freedom industries which is now in bankruptcy and a few also name the company or other company affiliates the complaints generally seek class action status raise claims based on a variety of tort statutory and contract theories and seek a combination of compensatory damages punitive damages medical monitoring and other equitable relief additionally investigations with respect to the matter have been initiated by the chemical safety board the us attorney’s office for the southern district of west virginia the west virginia attorney general and other governmental entities 

the company and wvawc believe that wvawc has responded appropriately to and has no responsibility for the freedom industries spill and the company wvawc and other companyaffiliated entities named in any of the lawsuits have valid meritorious defenses to the lawsuits the company wvawc and the other company affiliates inten d to vigorously contest the lawsuits nevertheless an adverse outcome in one or more of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation moreover the wvawc and the company are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing government investigations or any legislative initiatives that might affect water utility operations 

national benefits agreement 

in september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement we implemented our “last best and final” offer on january 1 2011 in order to provide health care coverage for our employees in accordance with the terms of the offer the unions have challenged our right to implement our last best and final offer in this regard following the filing by the utility workers union of america of an unfair labor practice charge the nlrb issued a complaint against us in january 2012 claiming that we implemented the last best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the federal mediation and conciliation service a state mediation agency and several state departments of labor we have asserted that we did in fact provide sufficient notice 

on october 16 2012 the nlrb administrative law judge hearing the matter ruled that although we did provide sufficient notification to the federal mediation and conciliation service we did not provide notice to state agencies in violation of the national labor relations act the administrative law judge ordered among other things that we cease and desist from implementing the terms of our last best and final offer and make whole all affected employees for losses suffered as a result of our implementa tion of 

our last best and final offer the “make whole” order if upheld on appeal would require us to provide backpay plus interest from january 1 2011 through the date of the final determination by the nlrb based on current estimates and assumptions we estimate the cash impact could be in the range of 35 to 45 million per year with the total impact dependent on the length of time the issue remains unresolved on november 2012 we filed an exception to the decision of the administrative law judge in order to obtain a review by the full nlrb we expect to hear from the nlrb during 2014 

2014 and beyond 

our strategy for the future will continue to focus on customer satisfaction and service  expansion through targeted growth environmental sustainability and constructive regulatory and public policy we will also continue to modernize our infrastructure and to focus on operational efficiencies while bolstering a culture of continuous improvement 

for 2014 and beyond we expect our earnings growth drivers to be 1 our regulated business investment 2 growth from acquisitions 3 growth in marketbased businesses and lastly 4 potential growth opportunities in serving the shale industry also in 2014 we anticipate savings from corporate expense reductions attributable to lower saprelated implementation costs lower pension costs further reduced headcount and lower interest expense resulting from our 2013 debt refinancings 

in 2014 we will continue to concentrate on our customers by achieving established customer satisfaction and service quality targets in regards to environmental sustainability we are committed to maximizing our protection of the environment reducing our carbon and waste footprints and water lost through leakage specific goals established for 2014 are to 

 











we will optimize our capital spend by not only focusing on how much we spend but the efficiency with which we spend it we estimate our capital expenditure plan for 2014 through 2018 will be approximately 58 billion of the 58 billion 51 million is expected to be utilized to upgrade our infrastructure and systems in addition to these capital expenditures we are also estimating additional capital investment over the fiveyear period for acquisitions and strategic capital of approximately 400 million and 300 million respectively strategic investments could include opportunities in the unregulated shale arena or a major concession our total capital plan for 2014 is estimated to be approximately 11 billion with approximately 900 million allocated to upgrading our infrastructure and systems 100 million for acquisitions and 100 million for strategic investment purposes 

we will engage in appropriate legislative and regulatory policy changes by actively addressing regulatory lag that impacts return on our investments and promoting constructive regulatory frameworks we expect to resolve three rate proceedings during 2014 and plan to file up to five general rate cases including one which was already filed in january 2014 additionally we will file for infrastructure surcharges and continue to pursue other mechanisms either as part of our general rate case filings or in separate filings which will provide opportunities to expedite the return of capital outside of the general rate case and continue to close the gap between our allowed and our earned regulated return 

we also expect to continue to improve our regulated om efficiency ratio we expect to achieve an om efficiency ratio equal to or below 35 by 2018 a significant component in both the optimization of capital spend and om efficiency objectives is to optimize our supply chain process to provide more value for each dollar of capital and om spent 

lastly we will look to execute our regulated acquisition strategy and continue to grow our marketbased operations in particular hos and our military services contracts while evaluating potential opportunities to assist the shale industry in the delivery of water to assist with their processes we will expand our regulated business segment through focused acquisitions andor organic growth while expanding in our marketbased segment from new core growth expanded markets and new offerings in regards to our marketbased operations as noted above in early january 2014 we added the hill air force base to our military contracts and have expanded our hos service line protection programs into three additional states we are committed to operating our business responsibly and managing our operating and capital costs in a manner that serves our customers and produces value for our shareholders we are committed to an ongoing strategy that leverages processes and technology innovation to make ourselves more effective and efficient

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by  134 million or 61 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 this increase was principally due to incremental taxes in the first half of 2013 associated with the properties acquired in our new york acquisition in the second quarter of 2012 also 2012 property taxes were lower due to the recognition of credit adjustments in indiana and missouri which reduced property tax expense in the third quarter of 2012 lastly gross receipts taxes were higher in our new jersey subsidiary by 35 million 

other income expenses other expenses increased 467 million or 159 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year this increase is principally attributable to the recognition of a pretax loss on debt extinguishment of 406 million in connection with the cash tender offer for our 6085 senior notes due 2017 the loss consisted of a repurchase premium of 394 million transaction fees of 07 million and a writeoff of 05 million for unamortized debt issuance costs also contributing to the increase was a reduction in allowance for funds used during construction “afudc” of 43 million resulting from decreased construction activities compared to the same period in 2012 including the winding down of our business transformation project

segment results of operations 

we have two operating segments which are also our reportable segments the regulated businesses and the marketbased operations these segments are determined based on how we assess performance and allocate resources we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocated resources based on several factors with the primary measure being income from continuing operations before income taxes 

regulated businesses segment 

the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated businesses for the periods indicated 

 



 

operating revenues our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide services to residential commercial industrial and other customers this business is subject to state regulation and our results of operations can be impacted sign ificantly by rates authorized by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate the table below details additional annualized revenues awarded including step increases and assuming a constant volume resulting from rate authorizations granted in 2013 2012 and 2011 

 



 













the effective dates for the more significant increases granted in 2012 were january 1 2012 april 1 2012 may 1 2012 and october 1 2012 for our california missouri new jersey and illinois subsidiaries respectively the effective date for the 2011 pennsylvania rate increase was november 11 2011 the 2011 increase in virginia was effective in march 2011 while the tennessee and west virginia increases were effect ive in april 2011 

as previously noted an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs such as mechanisms that permit a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure the following table details additional annualized revenue authorized through infrastructure surcharge mechanisms which were granted in 2013 2012 and 2011 as these surcharges are typically rolled into the new base rates and therefore are reset to zero when new base rates are effective certain of these charges may also be reflected in the total general rate case amounts awarded in the table above if the order date was following the infrastructure surcharge filing date 



 











comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

operating revenues increased by 29 5 million or 11 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 the increase in revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through rate authorizations for a number of our operating companies of which the impact was approximately 724 million additionally revenues increased by 164 million due to increased surcharge and amortization of balancing accounts lastly revenues were higher by 99 million as a result of acquisitions with the most significant being the result of our new york acquisition in the second quarter of 2012 additional four months of revenue in 2013 compared to 2012 and the acquisition of dale by our virginia subsidiary in the fourth quarter of 2013 these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues of approximately 645 million as a result of lower demand principally driven by the hot and dry weather conditions in the central and northeast portions of the country in 2012 versus cooler and wetter weather conditions in 2013 

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and billed water sales volume by customer class 



water services — consistent with the above discussion water service operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 totaled 24650 million a 213 million increase or 09 over the same period of 2012 however the mix between billed 

revenuesbilled volumes to unbilled revenuesunbilled volumes have changed significantly principally as a result of our cis implementation unbilled revenue has increased 257 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly as a result of delayed invoicing to customers with the implementation we made a decision to increase the level of scrutiny and verification around bills being generated by the new system in particular larger andor more complex bills as such bills that exceed certain tolerance levels are being held until verification can be performed as such the timing of issuance of bills has caused a decrease in billed volumes in 2013 when compared to 2012 with a corresponding increase in unbilled usage for our residential and commercial customers we believe that the majority of the decline in billed volumes is attributable to the weather abnormalities between 2012 and 2013 as well as the implementation of our new cis system by our regulated subsidiaries for the remaining customer classes we believe the decline in billed volumes is mainly due to the delay in invoicing the customer as a result of our cis implementation 

wastewater services — our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 10 states revenues from these services increased by 47 million or 60 to 828 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from the same period of 2012 the increase was primarily attributable to rate increases in our pennsylvania subsidiary as well as the dale acquisition in november 2013 

other revenues —other revenues  which includes such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees certain rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items increased 35 million or 82 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly due to the additional surcharge revenues offset by decreases in revenues related to billings for others reconnection and late fees 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense decreased 245 million or 22 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 operation and maintenance expense for 2013 and 2012 by major expense category were as follows 



 

production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal costs decreased by 36 million or 13 for 2013 compared to 2012 production costs by major expense type were as follows 



 

overall production costs de creased for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the prior year as a result of reduction in chemical and fuel and power costs resulting from decreased usage mainly attributable to lower consumption in most of our states 

 

employeerelated costs including salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense decreased 164 million or 35 for 2013 compared to 2012 these employeerelated costs represented 412 and 418 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2013 and 2012 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table 





 

the overall decrease in employeerelated costs was primarily attributable to decreased salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense the decrease in salaries and wages was mainly the result of lower employee incentive and stock compensation expense of approximately 59 million in addition to higher capitalization rates due to increased capital investment and a reduction in headcount partially offset by increased overtime and annual wage increases the decrease in pension expense was primarily due to decreased contributions in certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on our funding policy which is to fund at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 or the normal cost the reduction in group insurance expense is mainly attributable to higher capitalization rates and reduced headcount 

operating supplies and services include expenses for office operation legal and other professional services including transportation expenses information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges overall these costs increased  48 million or 23 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 



the overall increase in operating supplies and services was primarily due to increased contracted services and higher other operating supplies and services these increases were mainly due to incremental costs attributable to the continued maturity of our enterprise resource planning system in conjunction with the implementation of phase i and phase ii of our business transformation project additionally contracted services increased due to the use of contractors for other specific projects other increases in the other operating supplies and services costs are related to a 13 million increase in condemnation costs and a 12 million increase in conservation expense as well as the inclusion in 2012 of a 10 million reduction in anticipated insurance recovery of expenses incurred as a result of hurricane sandy and a 21 million credit adjustment resulting from the finalization of rate decisions in california and are offset by 16 million of insurance proceeds related to recovery of expenses related to hurricanes irene and sandy received in 2013 the decrease in office supplies and services due to cost containment efforts primarily related to employee travel transportation costs decreased due to the reduction of leased vehicles 

maintenance materials and services which includes emergency repair as well as costs for preventive maintenance de creased 152 million or 188 for 2013 compared to 2012 



 

the de crease of 152 million in 2013 is mainly attributable to 2012 including increased preventive maintenance expenses throughout our regulated subsidiaries including hydrant and tank painting meter testing pump tank and well maintenance and paving costs 

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 34 million or 68 for 2013 compared to 2012 



 

the increase in the uncollectible accounts expense was primarily due to an increase in our regulated businesses’ customer accounts receivable attributable to rate increases and an increase in the overall aging of receivables due to our cis implementation 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 25 million or 60 for 2013 compared to 2012   



 

insurance costs in 2013 were higher compared to 2012 primarily due to higher casualty insurance costs as a result of historical claims experience and retroactive adjustments 

operating expenses th e increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to the higher om expenses as explained above as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense of 263 million and higher general tax expense of 124 million the increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily due to additional utility plant placed in service including 108 million of incremental expense resulting from the assets placed in service for our business transformation project the increase in general tax expense is primarily due to higher property taxes in our new york subsidiary due to a full year of expense in 2013 on properties acquired in the second quarter of 2012 of 52 million the inclusion of property tax adjustments that reduced expense for our indiana and missouri subsidiaries by 40 million in 2012 and higher 2013 gross receipts taxes in our new jersey subsidiary of 35 million 

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

operating revenues increased by 1955 million or 83 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 the increase in revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through rate authorizations for a number of our operating compani es of which the impact was approximately 1287 million and higher consumption in our midwest and certain northeastern states in 2012 compared to 2011 which amounted to an increase of approximately 391 million the increased consumption is primarily attributable to the warmerdrier weather in our midwestern and certain of our northeastern states in the second and third quarters of 2012 lastly revenues were higher by 267 million as a result of revenues from newly acquired systems with the most significant being our new york acquisition in the second quarter of 2012 

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and billed water sales volume by customer class 

 





 

the following discussion related to water services indicates the increase or decrease in the regulated businesses’ revenues and associated billed water sales volumes in gallons by customer class 

water services —water service operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 totaled  24437 million a 1911 million increase or 85 over the same period of 2011 overall the water services revenue increase is related to increases in all customer classes and is mainly due to rate increases as well as increased sales volume the volume of water sold increased by 37 for the year ended december 31 2012 to 3668 billion gallons from 3537 billion gallons for the same period in 2011 we believe this higher consumption is attributable to the warmerdrier weather in our northeastern and midwestern operating states as compared to the prior year also contributing to the increased sales volume was the additional consumption resulting from our new york acquisition 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in nine states revenues from these services increased by 19 million or 24 to 782 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from the same period of 2011 the increase was primarily attributable to rate increases in a number of our operating companies 

other revenues —other revenues include such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees certain rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 a s compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly due to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to business interruption for our joplin missouri service area which was affected by tornados in 2011 

operation and maintenance operation and mai ntenance expense increased 374 million or 34 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 operation and maintenance expense for 2012 and 2011 by major expense category were as follows 



 

production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal costs increased by 122 million or 47 for 2012 compared to 2011 production costs by major expense type were as follows 



 

overall production costs increased for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the prior year mainly as a result of increased purchased water costs attributable to increased production resulting from higher consumption in most of our subsidiaries with more significant increases occurring in our california and illinois subsidiaries for 2011 our california subsidiary’s customer needs were met without the need for purchased water 

employeerelated costs including salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense decreased 178 million or 36 for 2012 compared to 2011 these employeerelated costs represented 418 and 448 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2012 and 2011 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table 



 

the overall decrease in employeerelated costs was primarily attributable to decreased salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense the decrease in salaries and wages was primarily due to higher capitalization rates due to increased capital investment and a reduction in headcount as a result of organizational streamlining and vacancies some of which have been backfilled with temporary labor and therefore included within contracted services in the operating supplies and services category below partially offsetting the decrease was higher costs resulting from wage increases higher stockbased compensation expense as well as increased costs due to the addition of employees from our new york acquisition the reduction in group insurance expense is mainly attributable to lower headcount as a result of vacancies a decrease in the overall cost per person as well as higher capitalization rates the decrease in pension expense was primarily due to decreased contributions in certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on our funding policy which is to fund at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 or the normal cost 

operating supplies and services include expenses for office operation legal and other professional services including transportation expenses information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges overall these costs increased 237 million or 127 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 



 

the overall increase in operating supplies and services was primarily due to increased contracted services and higher other operating supplies and services the contracted services increase was mainly due to incremental costs associated with the backfilling of positions including those vacated by employees who are assigned to our business transformation project the use of contractors for other specific projects the intent of which is to improve processes and operating efficiency and effectiveness over th e longterm and lastly additional costs resulting from the rollout and stabilization of our erp in the third quarter of 2012 the increase in the other operating supplies and services costs is primarily related to the rollout and stabilization of the erp in addition to incremental expenses associated with our new york acquisition of 11 million and an increase of 15 million for community relations and customer education in order to communicate the importance of water conservation additionally 2011 included a reduction of 22 million for an anticipated insurance recovery of expenses incurred as a result of severe weather storms in particular hurricane irene which is partially offset by a reduction recorded in 2012 of 10 million in anticipated insurance recovery of expenses incurred as a result of hurricane sandy partially offsetting the increase in other operating supplies and services was a 21 million credit adjustment recorded in 2012 resulting from the finalization of rate decisions in california 

maintenance materials and services which includes emergency repair as well as costs for preventive maintenance increased 80 million or 109 for 2012 compared to 2011 



 

the increase of 80 million in 2012 is mainly attributable to increased preventive maintenance expenses throughout our regulated subsidiaries including hydrant and tank painting meter testing pump tank and well maintenance and paving costs 

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 65 million or 153 for 2012 compared to 2011 



 

the increase in the uncollectible accounts expense was mainly the result of a refinement to our allowance for uncollectible calculation based on more detailed data trends which were derived in conjunction with the development of our new customer information system 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 47 million or 127 for 2012 compared to 2011 



 

insurance costs were higher compared to 2011 as 2012 insurance reflected incremental expense resulting from the resolution of prior years’ claims regulatory expenses increased in 2012 as a result of the inclusion in 2011 of a deferral of previously expensed costs in one of our subsidiaries 

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 is primarily due to the higher om expenses as explained above  as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense of 281 million resulting from additional utility plant placed in service and increased general taxes of 100 million principally attributable to higher property taxes relating to our new york acquisition 

marketbased operations segment

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 

operating revenues revenues decreased 49 million for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 primarily due to the lower revenues of 173 million resulting from termination of certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts most of which occurred in 2012 additionally revenues from capital project activities associated with military construction decreased 84 million due to lower levels of work as compared to the prior year these decreases were offset by a net increase of 40 million from price redeterminations for several of our military contracts as well as an increase of 166 million in our hos revenues associated with contract growth most notably in new york city 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense decreased  126 million or 45 for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012 

the following table provides information regarding operation and maintenance expense for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 by major expense category 

 



as noted in the table above decreases in operating supplies and services production costs and employeerelated costs were partially offset by an increase in maintenance materials and supplies the decrease in production costs and employeerelated costs is mostly due to the termination of certain municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts the decrease in operating supplies and services is attributable to the release of 38 million in loss contract reserves due to the resolution of certain outstanding issues and uncertainties additionally 2013 was impacted by decreased construction activity for our military contracts and is partially offset by increased hos contracted services expense as well as higher printing and postage costs associated with expanding into new markets including new york city the increase in maintenance materials and supplies is primarily due to higher hos repair costs which is attributable to new contracts an increase in the number of claims as well as the average cost per claim and is partially offset by the terminated municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts the decrease in the other category is mainly due to decreases in uncollectible accounts expense of 35 million which is due to 2012 including incremental amounts related to terminated contracts in addition to improved collection experience in 2013 for certain other municipal and industrial operations and maintenance contracts 

operating expense the decrease in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily driven by the decrease in operation and maintenance expense which is explained above

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

operating revenues the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 is primarily attributable to an 80 million increase in our hos revenues associated with conti nued contract growth and a price increase also contributing to the higher revenues was a 22 million increase in our contract operations group revenues which is mainly due to incremental revenues associated with military construction and operation and maintenance projects these increases were offset by decreases in our carbon services group revenues of 60 million as we are no longer providing these services to the regulated businesses and a decrease in revenues in our terratec business of 18 million 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense decreased 16 million or 06 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures our business is very capital intensive and requires significant capital resources a majority of these capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations when necessary we obtain additional funds from external sources in the debt and equity capital markets and through bank borrowings our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets if these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms we have access to an unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of 125 billion we rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to support our commercial paper program disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets see “—credit facility and shortterm debt” in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we through american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary issue commercial paper which is supported by the revolving credit facility awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 418 million of outstanding letters of credit under its credit facility as of december 31 2013 as of december 31 2013 awcc had 125 billion available under our credit facility that we could use to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and support our 6303 million outstanding commercial paper we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated operating companies receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or ot her contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines 

we use our capital resources including cash to i fund operating and capital requirements including construction expenditures ii pay off maturing debt iii pay dividends iv fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and v invest in new and existing ventures we spend a significant amount of cash on construction projects that we expect to have a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag see “business—regulation—economic regulation” we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since we continue to make investments equal to or greater than our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

we believe that our ability to access the capital markets our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our shortterm requirements we fund liquidity needs for capital investment working capital and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations public and private d ebt offerings commercial paper markets and to the extent necessary our revolving credit facility we believe we have sufficient liquidity and ability to manage our expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets 

in addition the company can delay major capital investments or other funding requirement s or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by among other things economic utility regulation infrastructure investment inflation compliance with environmental health a nd safety standards production costs customer growth declining per customer usage of water weather and seasonality and overall economic conditions 

cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditure requirements we will seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed there can be no a ssurance that we will be able to access such markets successfully on favorable terms or at all operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated 

 



  





our working capital needs are primarily limited to funding the increase in our customer accounts receivable and unbilled revenues which is mainly associated with the revenue increase as a result of rate increases in our regulated businesses we address the timing issue through the aforementioned liquidity funding mechanisms our cash collections for our regulated businesses’ accounts receivable has been slower than historical payment patterns in particular for those operating companies in which we implemented the new cis system in may 2013 we believe the slowdown in collections is the result of the system implementation and therefore is only temporary in nature we implemented the cis system in our remaining regulated businesses in october 2013 and we would expect to experience a similar slowdown in cash collections for these operating companies in the first half of 2014 

the decrease in cash flows from operations for the year ended december 31 2013 compared to the same period in 2012 is principally due to changes in working capital which is related to the aforementioned delays in billing and slower collections in our accounts receivable and the change in payables in 2013 as we were delayed in 2012 in executing payable at normal volumes due to the implementation of phase i of our business transformation project partially offsetting these working capital decreases was a reduction in the pension and postretirement healthcare contributions in 2013 

the increase in cash flows from operations for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 is primarily attributa ble to additional revenues in 2012 and lower pension and postretirement healthcare contributions 

the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 493 million in 2014 of which 107 million was already made in 2014 in addition we estimate that contributions will amount to 640 million in 2015 688 million in 2016 675 million in 2017 and 623 million in 2018 actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows for the periods indicated 

 



  



cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2013 principally as a result of incremental spending associated with the replacement of our transmission and distribution infrastructure 

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures related to upgrading our infrastructure and systems  

 



 

capital expenditure s for the year ended december 31 2013 increased by 517 million or 56 compared to 2012 principally due to our continued replacement of transmission and distribution infrastructure rehabilitation to storage facilities and dam rehabilitation and increased expenditures related to information systems and vehicles partially offsetting this increase was reduction in treatment and pumping expenditures due to the completion of certain water treatment plant projects in 2012 as well as a reduction in our business transformation expenses also due to completion of phase i of the project in 2012 and the implementation of a portion of phase ii in may 2013 

capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2012 increased by 37 million or 04 compared to 2011 mainly as a result of an increase in the replacement of transmissiondistribution infrastructure and higher business transformation project expenditures partially offset by a reduction in treatment and pumping expenditures due to the completion of ce rtain water treatment plant projects for which major expenditures occurred in 2011 

in 2013 we implemented phase ii the final phase of our business transformation project through december 31 2013 including afudc capital expenditures amounted to 3228 million on the project with 658 million spent in 2013 as we make adjustments to our operations as a result of this project we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure wh ile we believe such expenditures to realize the efficiencies can be recovered through regulated rates we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely rate recovery of these increased costs associated with this transformation project any such delays or difficulties encountered with such recovery may have a material and adverse impact on our business customer relationships and financial results 

the change in proceeds from sale of assets and securities from 2013 to 2012 and 2012 to 2011 reflects the fact that 2012 included cash proceeds of  5617 million received from the sale of our arizona new mexico and ohio subsidiaries in 2012 partially 

offset by cash proceeds used for acquisition purposes with the largest being the acquisition of additional regulated water operations in new york 

one avenue to seek growth is through tuckins by helping commissions with troubled water systems as well as other acquisitions that are complementary to our existing business and support the continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt or equity offerings 

the following provides a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities in the years indicated 

2013 





2012 





2011 





as previously noted in 2014 we estimate that our total capital plan is 11 billion with approximately 900 million allocated to upgrading our infrastructure and systems 100 million for acquisitions and 100 million for strategic investment purposes for years in the foreseeable future beyond 2014 we estimate such investment will be between 11 and 12 billion per year 

we intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base while working with regulators in the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment 

our investing activities could require considerable capital resources which we have generated through operations and attained through financing activities we can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc we intend to access capital markets on a regular basis subject to market conditions in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds this amounted to 193 million 319 million and 223 million for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as previously noted awcc is a whollyowned finance subsidiary of the company based on the needs of our regulated subsidiaries and the company awcc borrows in the capital markets and then through intercompany loans provides those borrowings to the regulated subsidiaries and the company the regulated subsidiaries and the company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to awcc in the amount necessary to enable awcc to meet its debt service obligations because the company’s borrowings are not a source of capital for the regulated subsidiaries the company is not able to recover the interest charges on the company’s 

debt through regulated water and wastewater rates as of december 31 2013 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to our regulated businesses amounting to 29 billion and 3909 million respectively additionally as of december 31 2013 awcc has made longterm fixed rate loans and commercial paper loans to the company totaling 7783 million and 2394 million to the company respectively 

on may 4 2012 we and awcc filed a universal shelf registration statement that enabled us to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities including common stock preferred stock and debt securities all subject to market demand and ratings status during 2013 and 2012 400 million and 300 million respectively of debt securities were issued pursuant to this filing 

as previously noted on october 8 2013 we announced the purchase and retirement through a tender offer of 2258 million in aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 608 senior notes due 2017 on october 8 2013 we paid 2718 million to effect the tender which in addition to the principal include d a repurchase premium of 394 million and accrued interest of 66 million also in october 2013 and related to the tender we recorded transaction fees of 07 million and a writeoff of 05 million for unamortized debt issuance costs the redemption was originally financed through commercial paper borrowing if we continue to finance this debt through commercial paper borrowings and with the assumption that current shortterm rates remain the same we would expect to have pretax interest expense savings of approximately 131 million in 2014 

on november 1 2013 we issued notices of redemption for 748 million and 750 million of outstanding senior notes with an original maturity date of 2038 and interest rates of 825 and 100 respectively these notes were retired on december 1 2013 

on november 20 2013 awcc issued 400 million of 3850 senior notes due 2024 

also on december 21 2013 an additional 1010 million with interest rate of 539 in senior notes matured

the following longterm debt was issued in 2012 

  



 







also in the second quarter of 2012 and in connection with the acquisition of our additional subsidiaries in new york we assumed debt of 252 million with coupon rates of 500 to 600 and maturity dates ranging from 2015 to 2035 in september 2012 we redeemed 109 million of these outstanding bonds with original maturity dates of 2031 to 2035 and interest rates ranging from 500 to 600 

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2012

the following longterm debt was issued in 2011 

 



 

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2011 

 



 

from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements via tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

credit facility and shortterm debt 

the shortterm debt balance consisting of commercial paper net of discount amounted to 6303 million and 2700 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

on october 29 2012 we terminated a previously maintained senior unsecured credit facility for 840 million and entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with 1 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of 14 banks and which was to have matured on october 29 2017 subject to up to two 1year extensions at our request on september 9 2013 the company announced that awcc and its lender had agreed to increase lending commitments under awcc’s revolving credit facility from 1 billion to 125 billion in addition 118 billion of the credit facility has been extended from its original termination date of october 2017 to october 2018 interest rates on advances under the facility are based on a credit spread to the eurodollar rate or base rate with the credit spread of 100 through june 2012 and then based on the higher of awcc’s moody’s investors service which we refer to as moody’s or standard  poor’s ratings services ratings which we refer to as sp credit rating at current ratings that spread would be 100 this facility requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 the facility will be principally used to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 1500 million in letters of credit 

we closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with this credit facility in accordance with the credit agreement no financial institution can have more than 2500 million of the aggregate commitment through the facility expiration date  if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances the company may request the other lenders to assume the defaulting lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment however the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender’s commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to replace a defaulting lender 

the following table provides information as of december 31 2013 and 2012 regarding the respective credit facility in effect at the time letters of credit sublimits and available funds under those revolving credit facilities as well as outstanding amounts of commercial paper and outstanding borrowings under the respective facilities 

  



awcc had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and 416 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 21 2014 also as of february 21 2014 awcc had 6299 million of commercial paper outstanding 

the weightedaverage interest rate on shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 was approximately 037  and 049 respectively 

capital structure 

the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

 



 

the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to changes in outstanding commercial paper balances the increase in 2011 was the result of funding the majority of 2011 cash requirements with commercial paper as a result of anticipating the proceeds from the divestiture of our arizona and new mexico regulated businesses in 2012 we used the net proceeds from the sale to pay down commercial paper in 2012 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue debt or access our revolving credit lines we were in compliance with our covenants as of december 31 2013 longterm de bt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things limit the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions 

certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2013 our ratio was 0 55 to 100 and therefore we were in compliance with the ratio 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets is directly affected by securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets we primarily access the capital markets 

including the commercial paper market through awcc however we also issue debt at our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities to lower our overall cost of debt 

on may 24 2013 standard  poor’s rating service “sp” upgraded its corporate credit rating to a on awcc and american water and awcc’s “a2” short term rating on that date they also confirmed its stable rating outlook for american water and awcc on may 29 2013 moody’s upgraded its rating outlook for both american water and awcc from baa2 to baa1 and revised its rating outlook to stable 

the following table shows the company’s securities ratings as of december 31 2013 

  



 

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flow is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of o ur borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when ther e are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that we provide collateral to secure our obligations we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend practice to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends rather than retaining that cash for other purposes we expect that dividends will be paid quarterly to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock will not be cumulative only declared dividends will be paid 

during 2013 2012 and 2011 we paid 1495 million 2135 million and 1579 million in dividends respectively for 2013 we paid a dividend of 028 per share on december 2 september 3 and june 3 to all shareholders of record as of november 15 2013 august 19 2013 and may 24 2013 respectively 

for 2012 we paid a dividend of 025 per share on december 28 december 3 and september 3 and 023 per share on june 1 and march 1 the december 28 2012 cash dividend payment of 025 per share would have historically been paid in march 2013 however the board approved accelerating the payment date to 2012 to take a dvantage of the existing 2012 tax rates for 2011 we paid a dividend of 023 per share on december 1 and september 1 and 022 per share on june 1 and march 1 

on december 13 2013 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 0 28 per share payable on march 3 2014 to all shareholders of record as of february 3 2014 

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt or equity securities at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a p eriodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims additionally annual policy renewals can be impacted by claims experience which in turn can impact coverage terms and conditions on a going forward basis we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business these financial obligations as of december 31 2013 are set forth in the table below 

  







publicprivate partnerships 

west virginiaamerican water company which we refer to as wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds 

commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

wvawc leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities which is presented within utility plant was approximately 158 1 million at december 31 2013 

performance obligations 

we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2060 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estim ated remaining contract revenues of 20 billion at december 31 2013 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2014 and 2048 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 9280 million at december 31 2013 some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are i nherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

our financial condition results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we account for these regulated operations in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to reflect the effe cts of rate regulation in our financial statements use of the authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria 1 thirdparty regulation of rates 2 costbased rates and 3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates as of december 31 2013 we had concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as a onetime extraordinary item and continued impacts on our operating activities 

regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow for recovery through rates charged to customers regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been i ncurred as of december 31 2013 we have recorded 8585 million of net regulatory assets including 2429 million of income taxes that are recoverable through rates within our consolidated financial statements also at december 31 2013 we had recorded 3733 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in appl icable regulatory environments recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our statement of operations and financial position could be materially affected 

goodwill 

the company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan at december 31 2013 the company’s goodwill was  12078 million the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

in september 2011 the fasb issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment the amendments allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a report ing unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount the amendments were effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 and early adoption was permitted 

the company decided to adopt this new guidance in 2012 and for its 2013 and 2012 annual tests applied the qualitative test “step 0” or “step 0 test” to its reporting units for the annual impairment test performed as of november 30 2013 and 2012 

the company completed a quantitative fair value measurement of its reporting units when performing its goodwill impairment analysis on november 30 2011 as of the 2011 testing date a quantitative assessment was made and implied that the fair value of its reporting units was well in excess of their carrying amount and no impairment was required 

in the 2013 and 2012 qualitative step 0 test at november 30 2013 and 2012 after assessing various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its base line november 30 2011 test the company determined that it was not required to calculate the fair value of its reporting units at november 30 2013 and 2012 the company determined that it was more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are greater than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairment is necessary 

on a periodic basis or in the case of a triggering event the company will use the twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fa ir value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values including goodwill on the measurement date if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporti ng unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a de cline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge 

for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 no impairment charge was recorded for the year ended december 31 2011 no impairment charge was recorded for our continuing operations in 2011 we recorded a pretax charge to goodwill of 255 million relating to parent company goodwill associated with businesses classified as discontinued operations 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the 

expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer invoice to the end of the accounting period unbilled utility revenues as of december 31 2013 and 2012 were 2171 million and 1806 million respectively increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue however since the majority of our customers are generally billed on a monthly basis total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged during 2013 and in connection with our cis implementation there are instances where billings to customers have been delayed including a conscious decision to delay billings in order to increase the level of scrutiny and verification around bills being generated by the new system in particular larger andor more complex bills as a result of these delays in billings unbilled revenues at december 31 2013 has increased significantly however total operating revenues would be materially unchanged due to a corresponding decrease in billed revenue 

revenue from marketbased operations is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided ove r the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

accounting for income taxes 

the parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for united states tax purposes members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns 

certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes the company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements these deferred income taxes are based on the ena cted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse in addition the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences previously flowed through to customers reverse 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation the pension plans have been closed for most employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2006 will be provided with a 525 of base pay 

defined contribution plan we also maintain other postretirement benefit plans which provide varying levels of medical and life insurance for eligible retirees these retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 the company also has several unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees the company does not participate in a multiemployer plan see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 









the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices at year end 2011 we began using an approach that ap proximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds the yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 512 417 and 502 at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 510 416 and 505 at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 749 for 2013 775 for 2012 and 790 for 2011 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 699 for 2013 741 for 2012 and 760 for 2011 

the asset allocations for the company’s us pension plan at december 31 2013 and 2012 by asset category are as follows 

 



 

the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocations for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2013 and 2012 by asset category are as follows 

 



 

the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and post retirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies t he assets values approximately 561 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 439 of the assets are valued using other inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 315  for 2013 319 for 2012 and 325 for 2011 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 725  in 2013 gradually declining to 500 in 2019 and thereafter 

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 



 

we will use a discount rate and eroa of 512  and749 respectively for estimating our 2014 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and eroa of 510 and 699 respectively for estimating our 2014 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2012 and 2011 pension and postretirement costs including such expenses charged to our discontinued operations were 722 million and 873 million respectively the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 493 million 640 million 688 million 675 and 623 million in 2014 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to e nter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps forward starting swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2013 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in a 63 million decrease in our pretax earnings 

in july 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 1000 million this agreement effectively converted the interest on 1000 million of outstanding 6085 fixed rate debt maturing 2017 to a variable rate of sixmonth libor plus 3422 we entered into this interest rate swap to mitigate interest cost at the parent company relating to debt that was incurred by our prior owners and was not used in any manner to finance the cash needs of our subsidiaries for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 the interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 20 and 24 million respectively as the swap interest rates are fixed through april 2014 a hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rates associated with the interest swap agreement would result in a 03 million decrease on our pretax earnings for the year ended december 31 2013 this calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates 

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the ability to recover price increases through rates nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations many of which are unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry th ese could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated activities for both our regulated businesses and marketbased operations our regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while our marketbased ope rations engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or 

industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates in addition pension and other benefits liabilities dec rease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields 

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

regulated businesses overview 

our primary business involves the ownership of subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater utility services to residential commercial industrial and other customers including sale for resale and public authority customers our subsidiaries that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state commissions or other entities engaged in economic regulation hereafter referred to as “pucs” in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters we report the results of our primary business in the regulated businesses segment 

as noted above for 2012 operating revenue for our regulated businesses segment was 25644 million accounting for 891 of total consolidated operating revenue for the same period regulated businesses segment operating revenues were 23689 million for 2011 and 22857 million for 2010 accounting for 888 and 895 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

the following charts set forth operating revenue for 2012 and customers as of december 31 2012 for the states in which our regulated businesses provide services 

 

marketbased operations overview 

we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs through our marketbased operations our marketbased operations include three lines of business 

 

   

  

 for 2012 operating revenue for our marketbased operations was 3303 million accounting for 115 of total operating revenue for the same period the marketbased operations’ operating revenue was 3278 million for 2011 and 2947 million for 2010 accounting for 123 and 115 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

our industry 

overview 

the united states water and wastewater industry has two main sectors i utility ownership which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers and ii general services which involves providing water and wastewater related services to water and wastewater utilities and other customers on a contract basis 

the utility sector includes investorowned as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions the environmental protection agency “epa” estimates that governmentowned systems make up the vast majority of the united states water and wastewater utility segment accounting for approximately 84 of all united states community water systems and approximately 98 of all united states community wastewater systems investorowned water and wastewater systems account for the remainder of the united states water and wastewater community water systems growth of service providers in the investorowned regulated utility sector is achieved through organic growth within a franchise area the provision of bulk water service to other community water systems andor acquisitions including small water and wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers that are in close geographic proximity to already established regulated operations which we herein refer to as “tuckins” 

the utility sector is characterized by high barriers to entry given the capital intensive nature of the industry the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in constant need of modernization and replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of water and wastewater residuals’ discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization the epa estimated that approximately 335 billion of capital spending would be necessary between 2007 and 2026 to replace aging infrastructure and to comply with standards to ensure quality water systems across the united states also in 2007 the epa estimated that approximately 390 billion of capital spending would be necessary over the next 20 years to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states in addition the 2011 american society of civil engineers’ report failure to act the economic impact of current investment trends in water and wastewater treatment infrastructure estimates that as investment needs continue to escalate and current funding trends continue to fall short of the needs it will likely result in unreliable water service and wastewater treatment according to the report this can result in water disruptions impediments to emergency response and damage to other types of infrastructure such as roads and bridges as well as water shortages from failing infrastructure and drought that may result in unsanitary conditions and increase the likelihood of public health issues 

  

the following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2007 through 2026 for united states water systems 

 

  

over the next several years we estimate that companyfunded capital investment for our operations will range between 800 million and 1 billion per year our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace existing infrastructure as needed and construction of facilities to meet environmental requirements and new customer growth the charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures by asset type and purpose of investment respectively 

 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generally require regulatory approval processes in order to do business which may involve obtaining relevant operating approvals including certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations from state pucs investorowned water and wastewater systems are generally subject to economic regulation by the state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters for both investorowned and governmentowned water and wastewater utilities 

the general services sector includes engineering and consulting companies and numerous other feeforservice businesses these include building and operating water and wastewater utility systems system repair services lab services sale of water infrastructure and distribution products such as pipes and other specialized services the general services segment is characterized by aggressive competition and marketdriven growth and profit margins 

according to the epa the utility segment of the united states water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented with approximately 54000 community water systems and approximately 15000 community wastewater facilities over half of the approximately 54000 community water systems are very small serving a population of 500 or less 

this large number of relatively small fragmented water systems as well as fragmented wastewater facilities may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread support services over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time 

  

water and wastewater rates 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generate operating revenue from customers based on rates that are generally established by state pucs through a ratesetting process that may include public hearings evidentiary hearings and the submission by the utility of evidence and testimony in support of the requested level of rates in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on six areas i the amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered “used and useful” in providing public service ii the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service typically by making reference to a representative 12month period of time known as a test year iii the appropriate rate of return iv revenue produced by existing rates v the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements across the customer base and vi the quality of service the utility provides including issues raised by customers 

water and wastewater rates in the united states are among the lowest for developed countries and for most us consumers water and wastewater bills make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services the following chart sets forth the relative cost of water and other public services including trash and garbage collection and sewer maintenance in the united states as a percentage of total household utility expenditures 

 

our regulated businesses 

our regulated businesses which consist of locally managed utility subsidiaries that generally are economically regulated by the states in which they operate accounted for 25644 million or 891 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2012 our regulated businesses provide a high degree of financial stability because i high barriers to entry provide certain protections from competitive pressures ii economic regulation promotes predictability in financial planning and longterm performance through the ratesetting process and iii our large customer base 

during 2012 we continued to execute our plan for optimizing our regulated businesses’ portfolio in january 2012 we completed the sale of all of our stock in our water and wastewater operating companies located in arizona and new mexico on may 1 2012 we completed the sale of our eight regulated water systems and one wastewater system in ohio ohio american water served approximately 58000 customers also on may 1 2012 we completed the purchase of seven regulated water systems in new york this acquisition added approximately 50000 customers to our new york regulated operations 

in may 2011 we completed the acquisition of 11 regulated water systems and 48 wastewater systems in missouri and in june 2011 we completed the sale of the assets of our texas regulated subsidiary the missouri acquisition added approximately 1700 water customers and nearly 2000 wastewater customers the texas assets served approximately 4200 water and 1100 wastewater customers in the greater houston metropolitan area 

  

as noted above as a result of these sales these regulated subsidiaries are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented therefore the amounts statistics and tables presented in this section refer only to ongoing operations unless otherwise noted 

the following table sets forth our regulated businesses operating revenue for 2012 and number of customers from continuing operations as well as an estimate of population served as of december 31 2012 

 

  

   approximately 877 of operating revenue from our regulated businesses in 2012 was generated from approximately 27 million customers in our seven largest states as measured by operating revenues in fiscal year 2012 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our annual operating revenue 

overview of networks facilities and water supply 

our regulated businesses operate in approximately 1500 communities in 16 states in the united states our primary operating assets include approximately 80 surface water treatment plants 500 groundwater treatment plants 1000 groundwater wells 100 wastewater treatment facilities 1200 treated water storage facilities 1300 pumping stations 90 dams and 46000 miles of mains and collection pipes our regulated utilities own substantially all of the assets used by our regulated businesses we generally own the land and physical assets used to store extract and treat source water typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our regulated businesses we have ongoing infrastructure renewal programs in all states in which our regulated businesses operate these programs consist of both rehabilitation of existing mains and replacement of mains that have reached the end of their useful service lives 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water we employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of the economic effect of weather extremes we 

  

might encounter in any particular service territory in any given summer some areas are likely to experience drier than average weather while other areas we serve will experience wetter than average weather 

our regulated businesses are dependent upon a defined source of water supply our regulated businesses obtain their water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams in addition we also obtain water from ground water sources such as wells and purchase water from other water suppliers 

the following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our regulated businesses for 2012 by volume 

 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we use comprehensive planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ sophisticated models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may to the extent possible be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development 

the percentage of finished water supply by source type for our top seven states by regulated businesses revenues for 2012 is as follows 

 

  

   

 the level of treatment we apply to the water varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources such as rivers typically require significant treatment while some groundwater sources such as aquifers require chemical treatment only in addition a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water purveyors treated water is transported through our transmission and distribution network which includes underground pipes above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water to the customers’ premises 

we also have installed production meters to measure the water that we deliver to our distribution network we employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption ranging from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices touch read or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards the treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent and the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

customers 

we have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our regulated businesses for the purposes of our regulated businesses an active customer is defined as a connection to our water andor wastewater networks a customer with both water and wastewater would count as two customers also as in the case of apartment complexes businesses and many homes multiple individuals may be served by a single connection 

residential customers make up the majority of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate in 2012 residential customers accounted for 912 of the customers and 596 of the operating revenue of our regulated businesses we also serve commercial customers such as shops and businesses industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we also supply water to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities as well as providing bulk water supplies to other water utilities for distribution to their own customers 

the following table sets forth the number of water and wastewater customers by customer class for our regulated businesses as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

   

the following table sets forth water services operating revenue by customer class and wastewater services operating revenue excluding other revenues for our regulated businesses for 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 the vast majority of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption typically on a monthly basis our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption 

customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions particularly during the summer our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenue and operating income summer weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues and operating income however when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies thereby reducing customer demand and operating revenue these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands other factors affecting our customers’ usage of water include conservation initiatives such as the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers declining household sizes in the united states and deterioration in the economy and credit markets which could have an adverse impact on our industrial and commercial customers’ operational and financial performance 

customer growth in our regulated businesses is driven by i organic population growth in our authorized service areas ii adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water andor wastewater utility systems and iii the sale of water to other community water systems generally we add customers through tuckins of small water andor wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers in close geographic proximity to areas where we operate our regulated businesses we will continue to acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuckins the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies historically pursuing tuckins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate certain markets in the united states where we do not operate our regulated businesses we will also selectively seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing and new markets before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for quality reliability and compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality standards 

supplies 

our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals energy and fuel as well as maintenance material and other critical inputs many of these inputs are subject to shortterm price volatility 

  

shortterm price volatility is partially mitigated through existing procurement contracts current supplier continuity plans and the regulatory rate setting process 

because of our geographic diversity we maintain relationships with many chemical equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace and we do not rely on any single entity for a material amount of our supplies we also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and longterm cost effectiveness as a result of this process and our strong relationships with suppliers we are able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations 

we typically have a combination of standby power generation or dual electric service feeds at key facilities multiple water production facilities emergency interconnections with adjacent water systems and finished water storage that keep our operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies 

regulation 

economic regulation 

our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective pucs the term “economic regulation” is intended to indicate that these state pucs regulate the economic aspects of service to the public but do not generally establish water quality standards which are typically set by the epa andor state environmental authorities state pucs have broad authority to regulate many of the economic and service aspects of the utilities for example state pucs often issue certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations that may be required for a company to provide service in specific areas they also approve the rates and conditions under which service is provided and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions and relationships between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations mergers and acquisitions in many instances approvals are required prior to the transaction regulatory policies not only vary from state to state but can change over time as well these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the pucs in the states in which we operate and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate case delays or inadequate rate recovery 

economic regulation of utilities involves many competing and occasionally conflicting public interests and policy goals the primary responsibility of pucs is to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and the utility although the specific approach to economic regulation varies certain general principles are consistent across the states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate for example based on certain legal and regulatory principles utilities are entitled to recover through rates charged to customers prudent and reasonable operating costs as well as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on and recovery of prudent used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers pucs will also generally accord a utility the right to serve specific areas and will also provide investorowned utilities with limited protection from competition because the requirement of an investorowned utility to operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations typically prevents other investorowned utilities from competing with it in the authorized area in return the utility undertakes the obligation to provide reliable service without unreasonable discrimination to all customers within the authorized area 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to a volumetric charge based on consumption and a base fee component set by a tariff approved by the puc the process to obtain approval for a change in rates generally involves filing a petition or “rate case” by the utility with the puc on a periodic basis as determined by the need to recover capital expenditures reduced consumption increased operating costs or the utility determines that its current authorized return is not sufficient given current market conditions to provide a reasonable return on investment a puc may also initiate a rate proceeding or investigation if it believes a utility 

  

may be earning in excess of its authorized rate of return or other issues exist which justify a review pucs may also impose other conditions on the content and timing of filings designed to affect rates rate cases often involve a lengthy administrative process that can be costly the utility the state puc staff consumer advocates and other customers and interveners who may participate in the process generally submit testimony and supporting financial data from a twelve month period of time known as the “test year” state statutes and puc rules and precedent usually determine whether the test year should be based on a historical period a historical period adjusted for certain “known and measurable” changes or forecasted data the majority of our states require the test year to be based on a historical period adjusted for certain known and measurable changes the evidence is presented in public hearings held in connection with the rate case which are economic and service quality factfinding in nature and are typically conducted in a triallike setting before the puc or an administrative law judge during the process the utility is required to provide puc staff and interveners with all relevant information they may request concerning the utility’s operations costs and investments the decision of the puc should be based on the evidence presented at the hearing 

some state pucs are more restrictive than others with regard to the types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their ratemaking processes and how they reach their final rate determinations however in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on a number of areas including the amount and prudence of investment in facilities operating and maintenance expenses and taxes the appropriate cost of capital and equity return revenues or consumption at current and expected levels allocation of the revenue requirements among customer classes service quality and issues raised by customers 

failure of the pucs to recognize reasonable and prudent operating and capital costs can result in the inability of the utility to earn the allowed return and can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete therefore there is frequently a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating cost increase and when those costs are reflected in rates for instance an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not begin to be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until the effective date of the subsequent rate case our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital recognition of declining consumption and appropriate recovery of utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files rate cases with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on and of invested capital that are permitted by the puc 

our regulated subsidiaries work with legislatures and pucs to mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag through the adoption of positive regulatory policies these policies include for example infrastructure replacement surcharges that allow rates to change outside the context of a general rate proceeding to reflect on a more timely basis investments to replace aging infrastructure necessary to sustain high quality reliable service currently pennsylvania illinois missouri indiana new york and more recently new jersey allow the use of infrastructure surcharges in 2012 the general assembly in pennsylvania passed legislation which expanded the use of infrastructure replacement programs to wastewater systems in the second quarter of 2012 the new jersey board of public utilities adopted rules that allow the implementation of a distribution system improvement charge for specified water infrastructure investments on july 20 2012 our new jersey subsidiary submitted a foundational filing for this charge our filing was approved on october 23 2012 

forwardlooking test year mechanisms allow us to earn on a more current basis our current or projected usage and costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital some states have permitted use of a fully forecasted test year instead of historical data to set rates examples of these states include illinois kentucky new york tennessee california and pennsylvania in all states in which we operate on a regulated basis pucs have allowed utilities to update historical data for certain “known and measurable” changes that 

  

occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year this allows utilities to take into account more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process the extent to which historical data can be updated will generally vary from state to state 

surcharge mechanisms are also available in a number of states to reflect outside of a general rate proceeding changes in major operating expenses which may be beyond the utility’s control for example new jersey california virginia and illinois have allowed surcharges for purchased water costs california has allowed surcharges for power and certain other costs and new york has allowed annual reconciliations for revenues and expenses such as power fuel chemicals and property taxes 

certain states have approved consolidated rates or singletariff pricing policies consolidated rates or singletariff pricing is the use of a unified rate structure for multiple water systems that are owned and operated by a single utility but may or may not be contiguous or physically interconnected the singletariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state based on costs that are determined on a statewide or intrastate regional basis thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for us and our customers for states that do not employ singetariffs we may have multiple general rate cases filed at any given point in time example of states that have adopted a full or partial singletariff pricing policy include pennsylvania new jersey missouri west virginia kentucky indiana illinois and iowa therefore of our seven largest states six have some form of singletariff pricing 

another mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag is the potential ability in certain circumstances to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is in service instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include pennsylvania kentucky virginia illinois and california in addition some states such as indiana allow the utility to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the puc assesses the prudency of such projects 

in some states the puc has implemented mechanisms to enhance utility revenue stability in light of conservation initiatives decreasing per capita consumption or other factors sometimes referred to as “decoupling” these mechanisms to some extent separate recoverable revenues from volumes of water sold for example the state of california has decoupled revenues from water sold to help achieve the state initiative to reduce water usage by 20 by 2020 this progressive regulation enables utilities to encourage conservation as revenues are not tied to sales similarly new york has implemented a surcharge or credit based on the difference between actual net revenues and the revenues allowed in the most recent rate order 

the company pursues these positive regulatory policies as part of our rate and revenue management program to enhance our ability to provide high quality sustainable cost effective service to customers to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments and to ensure positive shortterm liquidity and longterm profitability the ability of the company to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these policies will reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes however the company strives to use these and other regulatory policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater we are also subject to certain regulations regarding fire protection services in the areas we serve these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we 

  

also are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently the overall trend has been that they have become more stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could increase we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our regulated businesses are subject in the past we have generally been able to recover costs associated with compliance related to environmental health and safety standards but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy including responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural resources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples from across our water systems are analyzed on a regular basis for material compliance with regulatory requirements across the company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2012 we achieved a score of greater than 99 for drinking water compliance and according to the epa statistics american water’s performance has been far better than the industry average over the last several years in fact in 2012 american water was 30 times better than the industry average for compliance with drinking water quality standards maximum contaminant levels and 150 times better for compliance with drinking water monitoring and reporting requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water the united states epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 67 of our 81 surface water plants receiving the program’s “director” award we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 62 american water plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award while 55 have been awarded the “tenyear phase iii” award 

safe drinking water act 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources in 2006 the epa also proposed revisions to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule in 2012 the epa finalized revisions to the total coliform rule that were part of the mandate of a federal advisory committee appointed to negotiate the changes most of the anticipated changes to the rule will not be effective until 2016 the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds but we do not anticipate that any of these regulations will require implementation in 2013 

  

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act pursuant to the npdes program the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems we believe that we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals which generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the united states occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see “business—research and development” 

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters these proceedings are described further in the section entitled “item 3—legal proceedings” 

competition 

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct competition in providing services in our existing markets because i we operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a barrier to market entry our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors when pursuing acquisitions based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environnement american states water co and california water services group 

condemnation 

the potential exists that portions of our subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods 

 

   

  

 the acquisition consideration related to such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter we believe our operating subsidiaries would be entitled to fair market value for any assets required to be sold and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets 

we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business for example over the last several years threats of condemnation have been made with respect to certain parts of our water system near chicago illinois in 2008 the governing bodies of two illinois municipalities homer glen and bolingbrook passed resolutions to pursue a detailed valuation study of the water pipeline that delivers water in those communities several nearby municipalities joined in this study homer glen has also commissioned a study to determine the cost and feasibility of condemning illinoisamerican’s retail distribution system serving that community five municipalities passed ordinances enabling them to form a water agency to pursue eminent domain and the agency was officially formed in june 2012 in august 2012 the agency made an offer of 34 million for our pipeline the water agency later sent a letter increasing its offer to 376 million and provided a copy of an appraisal in december 2012 the water agency voted in favor of filing an eminent domain lawsuit in january 2013 the water agency filed an eminent domain case we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses 

our marketbased operations 

in addition to our regulated businesses we operate the following marketbased operations which generated 3303 million of operating revenue in 2012 representing 115 of total operating revenue for the same period of the lines of business outlined below no single group within our marketbased operations generates in excess of 10 of our aggregate revenue 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including om and design build and operate “dbo” contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities the food and beverage industry and other customers we typically make no longterm capital investment under these contracts with municipalities and other customers instead we perform our services for a fee during the contract term we may make limited short term capital investments under our contracts with the united states military and certain industrial customers our contract operations group generated revenue of 2327 million in 2012 representing 705 of revenue for our marketbased operations 

we are party to more than 80 contracts varying in size and scope across the united states and canada with contracts ranging in term from one to 50 years included in these contracts are nine 50year contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems on certain military bases all of our contracts with the us government may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to the standard terms of the us government contract termination provisions we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions 

  

on december 31 2011 we completed the sale of our applied water management inc group “awm” as noted above this subsidiary is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented therefore all amounts and statistics disclosed for the contract operations group refer only to ongoing operations of the contract operations group 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group through our service line protection program provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial establishments to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking water pipes and clogged or blocked sewer pipes inside and outside their accommodations 

our linesaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipalities during 2012 we entered into a contract with the new york city water board the “board” a corporate municipal instrumentality of the state of new york to offer our linesaver™ program to the board’s approximately 650000 residential customers we launched our first corresponding mailing in early january 2013 

our homeowner services group has approximately 970000 customer contracts in 27 states 

terratec environmental ltd 

our marketbased operations also includes our biosolids management group terratec which is located in canada and provides environmentally sustainable management and disposal of biosolids and wastewater byproducts 

competition 

we face competition in our marketbased operations from a number of service providers including veolia environnement american states water omi and southwest water particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competitive as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as the municipal and industrial fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process 

our homeowner services group faces competition outside our existing footprint primarily from homeserve usa and utility service partners inc 

research and development 

we established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our business our research and development personnel are located in new jersey in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports research through sophisticated testing and analysis since its inception our research and development program has evolved to become a leading waterrelated research program achieving advancements in the science of drinking water including sophisticated water testing procedures and desalination technologies 

since the formation of the epa in 1970 we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa has helped us to achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

  

in 2012 we spent 28 million on research and development compared to 26 million and 28 million spent in 2011 and 2010 respectively approximately onequarter of our research budget is comprised of competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers 

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical in providing quality and reliable service at reasonable rates in maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

support services 

our american water works service company subsidiary provides shared services and corporate governance that achieve economies of scale through central administration these services are provided predominantly to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services which are provided at cost may include accounting administration business development corporate secretarial education and training engineering financial health and safety human resources information systems internal audit legal operations procurement rates security risk management water quality and research and development these arrangements afford our operating companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis we also operate two national customer service centers which are located in alton illinois and pensacola florida 

our security department provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing implementing monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs we are in contact with federal state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply 

employee matters 

approximately 50 of our workforce is represented by unions we have 77 collective bargaining agreements in place with 18 different unions representing our unionized employees we have three union contracts beyond expiration that affect approximately 200 employees all of which are actively working under the old agreements over onequarter of our local union contracts will expire during 2013 

in september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement we implemented our last best and final offer on january 1 2011 in order to provide health care coverage for our employees in accordance with terms of the offer the unions have challenged our right to implement our last best and final offer in this regard following the filing by the utility workers union of america of an unfair labor practice charge the national labor relations board “nlrb” issued a complaint against us in january 2012 claiming that we implemented the last best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the federal mediation and conciliation service a state mediation agency and several state departments of labor we asserted that we did in fact provide sufficient notice 

on october 16 2012 the nlrb administrative law judge hearing the matter ruled that although we did provide sufficient notification to the federal mediation and conciliation service we did not provide notice to 

  

state agencies in violation of the national labor relations act the administrative law judge ordered among other things that we cease and desist from implementing the terms of our last best and final offer and make whole all affected employees for losses suffered as a result of our implementation of our last best and final offer the “make whole” order if upheld on appeal would require us to provide backpay plus interest from january 1 2011 through the date of the final determination based on current estimates and assumptions we estimate the cash impact could be in the range of 25 to 35 million per year with the total impact dependent on the length of time the issue remains unresolved in november 2012 we filed an exception to the decision of the administrative law judge in order to obtain a review by the full nrlb

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business 

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation decisions by state pucs and other regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are economically regulated by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses to enable us to finance the addition of new or the replacement of existing water and wastewater infrastructure and to provide us the opportunity to earn what they determine to be an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

  

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends upon the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be approved or that any approval will be given in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to cover our expenses including purchased water and costs of chemicals fuel and other commodities used in our operations enable us to recover our investment and provide us an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if water usage is less than anticipated in establishing rates as billings to customers are to a considerable extent based on usage in addition to a base rate or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than was estimated in establishing rates 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations compliance with increasingly stringent laws and regulations could impact our operating costs and violations of such laws and regulations could subject the company to substantial liabilities and costs 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include the united states clean water act of 1972 which we refer to as the clean water act and the united states safe drinking water act of 1974 which we refer to as the safe drinking water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations in addition state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

  

the current regulatory rate setting structure may result in a significant delay or “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can address these events through the rate case application process our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business 

there is typically a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience a regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

the company endeavors to reduce regulatory lag by pursuing positive regulatory policies for example six state pucs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments such as replacement of aging infrastructure these surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new puc approved rates other examples of such programs include states that allow us to increase rates for certain cost increases that are beyond the utility’s control such as purchased water costs or property taxes or power conservation chemical or other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates closer to the time costs have been incurred than would be the case under the rate case application process while these programs have been a positive development and we continue to work for expansion of programs to mitigate regulatory lag some state pucs have not approved such programs and there is no assurance that any puc will adopt any of them in the future or that existing programs will continue in their current form or at all in the future furthermore no state has adopted surcharge programs that include all elements of cost that may change between general rate proceedings for example no state puc has enabled us to address declining water usage through a surcharge although we intend to continue our efforts to expand state puc approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag our efforts may not be successful in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected 

availability of water supplies restrictions on use natural hazards severe weather conditions climate variability competing uses and economic conditions may adversely affect our access to sources of water the demand for water services or our ability to supply water to customers 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time may adversely impact our water supply supply issues brought on by climate variability such as drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an october 20 2009 order of the california state water resources control board the “2009 order” that our subsidiary californiaamerican water company “cawc” significantly decrease its diversion from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule running through december 31 2016 we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements 

  

of the endangered species act we have implemented conservation rates and other programs to address demand and are utilizing aquifer storage and recovery facilities to store winter water for summer use we were hopeful that we could address the water supply issues in a meaningful way through a regional desalination project the “project” that was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cawc however the project was subject to considerable delay and disputes among the parties on july 7 2011 mcwra advised mcwd and cawc that the agreements were void and on january 17 2012 cawc publicly announced that it had withdrawn support of the project finally on july 12 2012 the california public utility commission “cpuc” closed the proceedings relating to the project nevertheless disputes among the parties with respect to the project continued throughout 2012 and while cawc and mcwra have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve their disputes the terms of the settlement agreement are largely contingent on approval by the cpuc of the settlement agreement as well as cwac’s recovery through rates of its provision to mcwra of 19 million in loan forgiveness and up to approximately 15 million in additional payments moreover cawc’s disputes with mcwd remain unresolved and subject to ongoing litigation following its withdrawal of support for the project cawc filed an application with the cpuc on april 23 2012 for approval of the monterey peninsula water supply project the “new project” the new project involves construction of a desalination plant and related facilities all to be owned by cawc in addition the new project may encompass cawc’s purchase of water from the proposed monterey peninsula groundwater replenishment project a joint project between the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the monterey peninsula water management district “mpwmd” in its application cawc seeks approval to construct a desalination plant that can accommodate 96 million gallons per day however if the groundwater replenishment project meets certain specified timing and reasonable cost criteria cawc would make the appropriate filing to reduce the size of the desalination plant so that it accommodates 64 million gallons per day cawc has estimated the total project capital cost for the 96 million gallons per day desalination plant and related facilities to be approximately 384 million 330 million if the size of the plant is reduced to 64 million gallons per day the application also seeks cpuc approval of ratemaking mechanisms designed to enable cawc to recover its costs related to construction and operation of the new project including funding for principal and interest on a state revolving fund loan that cawc believes it is eligible to receive cawc’s ability to move forward on the new project will be subject to extensive administrative review including public hearings before the cpuc and testimony from intervening parties in addition a large number of federal state and local approvals must also be obtained moreover on january 29 2013 cawc provided a letter to the california state water resources control board stating that even if the cpuc were to adhere to its schedule for a final cpuc action with respect to the new project application in december 2013 or january 2014 cawc does not expect to have an operational water supply project that will enable cawc to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river by december 31 2016 as required by the 2009 order we cannot predict the ultimate effect of the events described above on cawc’s efforts to secure alternative sources of water or on cawc’s exposure to liabilities as a result of its ongoing disputes relating to the project or its inability to meet the december 2016 deadline under the 2006 order if cawc is unable to secure an alternative source of water or if other adverse consequences result from the events described above our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas if a regional drought were to occur governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system following drought conditions water demand may not return to predrought levels even after restrictions are lifted decreased use of water services resulting from any of these events may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas these include winter storms and freezing conditions high wind conditions tornados earthquakes floods or high water conditions in or near designated flood plains hurricanes and severe electrical storms these weather events may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage in the third quarter of 2011 our new jersey and pennsylvania subsidiaries experienced service interruptions in certain of our operating areas and in some cases a loss in customers as a result of the extreme weather including hurricane irene and other severe storms in the northeast 

in october 2012 our east coast subsidiaries were impacted by the weather conditions from hurricane sandy although we continue to assess the situation the damage to our facilities and infrastructure within the states of maryland new jersey new york pennsylvania virginia and west virginia was quickly addressed the most significant impact to our business was caused by the widespread power outages caused by the storm’s heavy winds rain and snow upon completion of the evaluation of the damages and any associated business interruption losses claims will be submitted to our insurance carriers we anticipate expenses that are not covered by insurance are likely recoverable through the rate making process on a statebystate basis 

in addition the devastating tornado that struck joplin missouri on may 22 2011 caused extensive damage to our infrastructure and the water distribution system among other things we lost our service center and plant storage buildings and suffered damage to the roof and windows at our water treatment plant as well as to many of our vehicles in addition while our water treatment plant remained operational the lack of electricity forced us to operate on generator power until electric power was restored within the next two days we also had to address more than 4000 leaking customer service lines and 25 torn fire service lines because it was not possible to maintain system pressure initially the missouri department of natural resources issued a boil water order the order was lifted after we restored full pressure to the system flushed the entire system and completed sampling tests all within six days after the order was issued any interruption in our ability to supply water or to collect treat and properly dispose of wastewater or any costs associated with restoring service could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore losses from business interruptions or damage to our facilities might not be covered by our insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

adverse economic conditions can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection or treatment systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages which may not be recoverable in rates this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition moreover if we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow our losses might not be covered by insurance and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

our inability to efficiently implement our business transformation project could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our internal controls environment operations and profitability 

we have undertaken a “business transformation” project which is intended to improve our business processes and upgrade our antiquated core information technology systems this multiyear enterprisewide 

  

initiative is intended to support our broader strategic initiatives the project is intended to optimize workflow throughout our field operations improve our backoffice operations and enhance our customer service capabilities the scale and anticipated future costs associated with the business transformation project are significant and we could incur costs significantly in excess of budgeted costs any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting in august 2012 our new business systems associated with phase i of our business transformation project became operational phase i consisted of the rollout of the enterprise resource planning systems “erp” which encompass applications that will handle human resources finance and supply chainprocurement management activities phase ii consists of the rollout of a new enterprise asset management system which will manage an asset’s lifecycle and a customer information system which will contain all billing and data pertaining to american water’s customers for our regulated segment phase ii is expected to be substantially completed by december 31 2013 as we make adjustments to our operations as a result of this project we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure although efforts have been made to minimize any adverse impact on our controls we cannot assure that all such impacts have been mitigated we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely or adequate rate recovery of any increased costs associated with the business transformation project as of december 31 2012 we have spent 2578 million on the project with 1181 million spent in 2012 

as we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project 

we operate numerous information technology systems that have varying degrees of integration sometimes leading to inefficiencies therefore delays in completion of the business transformation project will also delay cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the project we may also experience difficulties consolidating our current systems moving to a common set of operational processes and implementing a successful change management process these difficulties may impact our ability to meet customer needs efficiently any such delays or difficulties may have a material and adverse impact on our business client relationships and financial results 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is very capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2012 we invested 9286 million in net companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems could increase in the future we fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt and equity securities we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all 

in addition we believe that our dividend policy could limit our ability to pursue growth in particular the use of cash to pay dividends could affect our ability to make large acquisitions or pursue other growth opportunities that require cash investments in amounts greater than our available cash and external financing resources in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions including tuckin acquisitions principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we expect that we will need additional financing however we intend to retain sufficient cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 

  

if we do not obtain sufficient capital we may be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment realize our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and successfully expand the rate base upon which we are able to earn future returns on our investment and a return of our investment even if we have adequate resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital expenditures on time as a result of construction delays or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our water service and our revenues 

demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other outside water use throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months demand tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans these assets are subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if future returns on these assets are insufficient to offset the decline in value additionally the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease thereby reducing returns our liabilities increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of our obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates and our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2012 our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 55953 million and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or issue new debt securities in the capital markets moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2013 and 2014 are 1160 million and 128 million respectively  we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

approximately 50 of our workforce is represented by unions we have 77 collective bargaining agreements in place with 18 different unions representing our unionized employees we might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are favorable to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity in september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement we implemented our “last best and final” offer on january 1 2011 in order to provide health care coverage for our employees in accordance with the terms of the offer the unions have challenged our right to implement our last best and final offer in this regard following the filing by the utility workers union of america of an unfair labor practice charge the national labor relations board “nlrb” issued a complaint against us in january 2012 claiming that we implemented the last best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the federal mediation and conciliation service a state mediation agency and several state departments of labor we have asserted that we did in fact provide sufficient notice on october 16 2012 the nlrb administrative law judge hearing the matter ruled that although we did provide sufficient notification to the federal mediation and conciliation service we did not provide notice to state agencies in violation of the national labor relations act the administrative law judge ordered among other things that we cease and desist from implementing the terms of our last best and final offer and make whole all affected employees for losses suffered as a result of our implementation of our last best and final offer the “make whole” order if upheld on appeal would require us to provide backpay plus interest from january 1 2011 through the date of the final determination based on current estimates and assumptions we estimate the cash impact could be in the range of 25 to 35 million per year with the total impact dependent on the length of time the issue remains 

  

unresolved in november 2012 we filed an exception to the decision of the administrative law judge in order to obtain a review by the full nlrb although no work stoppages have occurred with respect to the expired contracts described above we cannot provide assurance that a work stoppage or strike will not occur while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur we cannot assure that a strike or work stoppage would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries to civil or criminal enforcement actions private litigation and cleanup obligations 

our water supplies are subject to contamination including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and possible terrorist attacks if one of our water supplies is contaminated we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply and locate an adequate supply of water from another water source including in some cases through the purchase of water from a thirdparty supplier if we are unable to access a substitute water supply in a costeffective manner our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods we might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates or recovery of these costs may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort or other lawsuits criminal enforcement actions contractual obligations or other consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we own approximately 90 dams a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs can be and has been material we might not be able to recover such costs through rates the inability to recover these higher costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in reservoirs located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or 

  

be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments 

our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations we rely on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external source of liquidity is our revolving credit facility we regularly use our commercial paper program as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we obtain in the commercial paper market however disruptions in the capital markets could limit our ability to access capital while our credit facility lending banks have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs particularly if borrowings through the commercial paper market are unavailable we maintain a 10 billion revolving credit facility commitments under this revolving credit facility mature in october 2017 subject to up to two 1year extensions at our request our inability to maintain renew or replace these commitments could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and 276 million of outstanding letters of credit under the credit facility as of february 21 2013 awcc had 2951 million of outstanding commercial paper as of february 21 2013 we cannot assure that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital and credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures 

any impediments to our access to the capital markets failure of our lenders to meet their commitments increased interest expense or cash conservation measures resulting from financial market disruptions or otherwise could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity including the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include substantial goodwill at december 31 2012 our goodwill totaled 12073 million the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 and the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past in the aggregate goodwill impairment charges including those recognized in our discontinued operations taken in each year from 2006 through 2009 totaled approximately  193 billion and reduced net income by approximately  191 billion 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in our market price consistent with our peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain our credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and 

  

operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain should a municipality or other government subdivision seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain we may resist the acquisition for example over the last several years threats of condemnation have been made with respect to certain parts of our water system near chicago illinois in 2008 the governing bodies of two illinois municipalities homer glen and bolingbrook passed resolutions to pursue a detailed valuation study of the water pipeline that delivers water in those communities several nearby municipalities joined in this study homer glen has also commissioned a study to determine the cost and feasibility of condemning illinoisamerican’s retail distribution system serving that community five municipalities passed ordinances enabling them to form a water agency to pursue eminent domain and the agency was officially formed in june 2012 in august 2012 the agency made an offer of 34 million for our pipeline the water agency later sent a letter increasing its offer to 376 million and provided a copy of an appraisal in december 2012 the water agency voted in favor of filing an eminent domain lawsuit in january 2013 the water agency filed an eminent domain case contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated business’s management from the operation of its business moreover our efforts to resist the acquisition may not be successful 

if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges 

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2012 we had us federal and state net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 10478 million and 6634 million respectively our federal nol carryforwards begin to expire in 2028 and our state nol carryforwards will expire between 2013 and 2032 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income moreover because our previous owner’s divestiture of its stock was considered an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code the amount of nol carryforwards that may be utilized in any year is limited our management believes the federal nol carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and therefore currently require no valuation allowance at december 31 2012 1926 million of the state nol carryforwards have been offset by a valuation allowance because the company does not believe these nols will more likely than not be realized in the future and we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our nols the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income 

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover changes in income tax laws the economy and general business environment could affect the future utilization of the nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our marketbased operations through american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients who may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased operations do not satisfy certain obligations 

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased operations including financial guarantees or deposits in the event our marketbased operations fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

  

at december 31 2012 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 29524 million and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased operations grow the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 

our marketbased operations’ longterm contracts with the department of defense may be terminated for the convenience of the us government and are subject to periodic contract price redetermination 

all of our contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is typically subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to maintain those systems which may negatively affect us as the operators of the systems 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner to undertake capital improvements in some cases we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner 

risks associated with our portfolio optimization efforts may adversely affect us 

under our portfolio optimization initiative we will continue to seek to acquire or invest in additional water andor wastewater systems while disposing of other systems these transactions are designed to enable us to achieve a more rationalized portfolio cost structure improvements and an enhanced financial profile we will consider acquiring systems in markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses and through tuckins we also will continue to seek to enter into related marketbased businesses and services that complement our businesses acquisition transactions may result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 with respect to dispositions we may be unable to sell on acceptable terms systems that we no longer believe are suitable for our portfolio 

  

we may also experience difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals for acquisitions or dispositions and any regulatory approvals we obtain may require us to agree to costly and restrictive conditions imposed by regulators we may not identify all significant risks when reviewing a potential transaction and we could be exposed to potential liabilities for which we will not be indemnified or in the case of dispositions we may be required to continue to assume liabilities with respect to systems that we sell we also may encounter difficulties in integrating new businesses including bringing newly acquired businesses up to the necessary level of regulatory compliance retaining and integrating key personnel achieving strategic objectives and integrating acquired assets and technological systems the demands of identifying and transitioning newly acquired businesses or pursuing investment opportunities may also divert management’s attention from other business concerns and otherwise disrupt our business any of these risks may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our marketbased operations are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received 

some of our marketbased operations enter into longterm contracts pursuant to which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee our marketbased operations are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party in addition directly or through our marketbased subsidiaries we often guarantee our marketbased operations’ obligations under those contracts losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we rely on our information technology “it” systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations we depend on our it systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections our it systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers a number of our current it systems are antiquated and it is increasingly difficult to obtain upgrades to and support for these systems while we intend to replace these systems through the business transformation process described above for the time being we remain subject to risks that are underscored by the age of our it systems specifically our it systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and other adverse consequences in addition the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us 

  

in addition we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

in 1995 the california state water resources control board issued an administrative order the “1995 order” to californiaamerican water company “cawc” requiring cawc to implement an alternative water supply in lieu of diversions from the carmel river the state water resources control board held administrative hearings in the summer of 2008 to address claims that cawc has exceeded its water diversion rights in the carmel river and has not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by the 1995 order the state water resources control board adopted a cease and desist order applicable to cawc on october 20 2009 the “2009 order” the 2009 order finds that cawc has not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river as required by the 1995 order the 2009 order requires among other things that cawc significantly decrease its yearly diversions from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule running from the date the 2009 order was adopted 

  

until december 31 2016 at which point all unpermitted diversions must end failure to effect the decrease in diversions mandated by the 2009 order could result in substantial penalties we can provide no assurances that cawc will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to us 

in july 2012 cawc the state water resources control board and other parties to cawc’s previously filed appeal of the 2009 order and a related action entered into a stipulation for dismissal without prejudice agreement to toll statute of limitations and proposed order the “stipulation” under the stipulation among other things the actions against the state water resources control board generally are to be dismissed without prejudice and the statute of limitations related to any future judicial review of the 2009 order as to claims alleged in cawc’s appeal of the 2009 order and in a related action will be tolled the superior court of the state of california for santa clara county approved the stipulation on august 1 2012 and the actions will be dismissed upon resolution of a request for attorneys’ fees made by the sierra club an intervening party in one of the actions 

in connection with the pending application for the monterey peninsula water supply project described below cawc provided a letter to the state water resources control board on january 29 2013 stating that even if the california public utilities commission “cpuc” were to adhere to its schedule for a final cpuc action with respect to the application in december 2013 or january 2014 cawc does not expect to have an operational water supply project that will enable cawc to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river by december 31 2016 as required by the 2009 order 

on december 2 2010 the cpuc approved the regional desalination project the “project” involving the construction of a desalination facility on the california central coast north of monterey the project was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements collectively the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cawc the desalination facility was to be constructed and owned by mcwd and mcwra was to construct the wells that were to supply water to the desalination facility the project was intended among other things to fulfill cawc’s obligations under the 1995 order in addition to other obligations 

the project was subject to delay due to among other things funding delays and investigations and inquiries initiated by public authorities relating to an alleged conflict of interest concerning a former member of the mcwra board of directors the “former director” the former director was paid for consulting work by a contractor to mcwd while serving on the mcwra board of directors the contractor subsequently was retained as project manager for the project on november 15 2011 the monterey county district attorney charged the former director with two felony counts of conflict of interest relating to the project as well as additional felony and misdemeanor counts for other activities 

on july 7 2011 mcwra advised mcwd and cawc that the agreements were void as a result of the conduct of the former director subsequently on august 12 2011 cawc advised mcwd and mcwra that they have defaulted in performance of certain financing obligations under the water purchase agreement by letter delivered to mcwd and mcwra on september 28 2011 cawc terminated the agreements based on mcwra’s repudiation of the agreements in other communications among the parties each of mcwd and mcwra have stated that it complied with the financing obligations and mcwd further responded that among other things cawc did not comply on a timely basis with an obligation under the water purchase agreement that cawc provide a letter of credit mcwd also asserted that the agreements remain in effect on january 17 2012 following unsuccessful mediation efforts among the parties cawc publicly announced that it had withdrawn support of the project 

disputes among the parties with respect to the project continued throughout 2012 in public filings before the cpuc mcwd asserted among other things that if the cpuc determines that the project is no longer the preferred water supply solution it should require cawc to reimburse mcwd for all costs expended by mcwd 

  

in connection with the project mcwra asserted that it was entitled to reimbursement of all costs or expenses relating to the project including enumerated expenses under the wpa each of mcwd and mcwra also claimed entitlement to forgiveness of the indebtedness to cawc that it incurred in connection with the project in response cawc challenged mcwd’s claim that it is entitled to reimbursement for certain purported litigation expenses and has stated generally that in light of the failure of mcwd and mcwra to fulfill their contractual obligations under the wpa their entitlement to reimbursement is unclear on july 12 2012 the cpuc closed the proceedings relating to the project in its decision the cpuc stated that there may be costs that have been incurred with respect to the project that may be recoverable in rates but that it would examine the recoverability of such costs in other proceedings cawc plans to file a new application seeking recovery of legal costs relating to the project after any pending legal disputes are resolved 

on september 17 2012 cawc and mcwra entered into a tolling and standstill agreement whereby each party agreed to toll the statute of limitations on any claims either party may have against the other with respect to the project and agreed not to commence litigation against the other while the agreement is in effect other than a civil proceeding for declaratory relief relating to the validity of the agreements which as noted below cawc filed on october 4 2012 

cawc sought to enter into a similar tolling and standstill agreement with mcwd but mcwd refused to do so therefore on september 18 2012 cawc filed a formal claim with the mcwd board seeking monetary damages against mcwd in its claim cawc alleges that the project was terminated due to among other things mcwd’s breach of one of the agreements by failing to use its best efforts to obtain project financing that mcwd has failed to repay approximately 6 million loaned by cawc to mcwd in connection with the project and that cawc made substantial expenditures in connection with the project which it is entitled to recover from mcwd cawc has claimed damages potentially in excess of 20 million on november 2 2012 mcwd provided notice that the board of mcwd rejected cawc’s claims for damages cawc has six months from such date to file a court action on this claim 

on october 4 2012 cawc filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the monterey county superior court against mcwra and mcwd seeking a determination by the court as to whether the agreements are void as a result of the former director’s alleged conflict of interest or remained valid on november 21 2012 mcwd filed an answer to cawc’s complaint a motion to change venue and a crosscomplaint for declaratory relief mcwd’s crosscomplaint seeks a judicial declaration that any challenge to the validity of the agreements are timebarred or barred by the california public utilities code mcwra filed its answer to cawc’s crosscomplaint on december 7 2012 in its answer mcwra alleges among other things that this action must be stayed pending conclusion of the criminal proceeding relating to the alleged conflict of interest by the former director after cawc indicated that it did not object to a change of venue the monterey county superior court approved mcwd’s motion to transfer the case to san francisco county superior court and the transfer was accepted by the san francisco county superior court on january 30 2013 

in december 2012 cawc mcwra and the county of monterey entered into a settlement agreement under which cawc will forgive approximately 19 million previously loaned by cawc to mcwra in connection with the project and cawc will make additional payments of up to approximately 15 million to mcwra approximately half of which will be paid directly to mcwra the remaining amount will be placed in an escrow account to pay claims of consultants and contractors against mcwra relating to the project the settlement agreement the debt forgiveness and the additional payments will be conditioned on cpuc approval including approval of cawc rate recovery of the debt forgiveness and the additional payments on december 4 2012 the monterey county board of supervisors approved the settlement agreement the settlement agreement does not affect cawc’s complaint for declaratory relief on the issue of whether the agreements are void or valid cawc expects to file an application for cpuc approval of the settlement agreement before the end of the first quarter of 2013 

on april 23 2012 cawc filed an application with the cpuc for approval of the monterey peninsula water supply project the “new project” the new project involves construction of a desalination plant and 

  

related facilities all to be owned by cawc in addition the new project may encompass cawc’s purchase of water from the proposed monterey peninsula groundwater replenishment project a joint project between the monterey regional water pollution control agency and the monterey peninsula water management district “mpwmd” the new project also would involve aquifer storage and recovery through an already established aquifer storage and recovery program between cawc and the mpwmd in its application cawc seeks approval to construct a desalination plant that can accommodate 96 million gallons per day however if the groundwater replenishment project meets certain specified milestones by the time cawc is ready to construct the plant currently estimated to be near the end of 2015 and the cost for water to be purchased by cawc is reasonable cawc would make the appropriate filing to reduce the size of the desalination plant so that it accommodates 64 million gallons per day 

cawc has estimated the total project capital cost for the 96 million gallons per day desalination plant and related facilities to be approximately 384 million 330 million if the size of the plant is reduced to 64 million gallons per day cawc stated in the application that it anticipates based on discussions with the state water resources control board that it is eligible for a state revolving fund loan for the new project the application also seeks cpuc approval of ratemaking mechanisms designed to enable cawc to recover its costs related to construction and operation of the new project including funding for principal and interest on the state revolving fund loan 

cawc’s ability to move forward on the new project will be subject to extensive administrative review including public hearings before the cpuc and testimony from intervening parties in addition a large number of federal state and local approvals must also be obtained one possible impediment a monterey county ordinance the “ordinance” limiting sponsorship of a desalination project to governmentowned enterprises was removed as a result of the settlement agreement described above in accordance with the settlement agreement monterey county the “county” agreed to dismiss with prejudice its complaint for declaratory relief before the california superior court in and for the county of san francisco asserting among other things that the ordinance applies to cawc the court closed the case on december 13 2012 in addition under the settlement agreement the county and mcwra agreed to offer reasonable support to cawc for timely completion of the new project subject to their right to exercise independence and discretion in taking any action with respect to the new project 

in a scheduling ruling issued in august 2012 the cpuc indicated that it expects to take final action on cawc’s application for the new project by january 2014 however these dates are subject to change we cannot guarantee that cawc’s application for the new project will be approved or that the new project will be completed on a timely basis if ever 

san clemente dam 

the san clemente dam is a 106foot high concrete arch dam located approximately 185 miles from the pacific ocean on the carmel river it was constructed in 1921 and has been operated by cawc since 1966 in 1980 the california department of water resources division of safety of dams “dsod” directed cawc to evaluate the structural integrity of the dam in the event of severe earthquakes or floods that could overtop the dam in 1992 cawc concluded that under certain conditions the san clemente dam might not be stable in the event of a “maximum credible earthquake” the maximum earthquake that appears capable of occurring under the presently known geologic framework the studies also concluded that a “probable maximum flood” the flood that may be expected from the most severe combination of critical meteorological and hydrologic conditions that is reasonably possible in the drainage basin under study could overtop the dam by fourteen feet and cause excessive erosion in the area of the downstream abutments based on these findings dsod ordered cawc to improve the san clemente dam to address these issues 

since 1992 there have been numerous engineering and environmental studies regarding the proposed solution to the san clemente dam’s stability although dam buttressing was originally the favored project of 

  

cawc and dsod cawc began to explore dam removal on a parallel track in response to comments made by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration’s national marine fisheries services “nmfs” on dsod’s 1999 draft environmental impact report dsod certified the final environmental impact reportenvironmental impact statement “eireis” in january 2008 the final eireis focused on two possible projects the dam buttressing project and a project to reroute the carmel river and remove the dam the “reroute and removal project” but remained neutral as to which project cawc should pursue 

the reroute and removal project became cawc’s preferred project subject to cpuc approval and ratepayer recovery cawc committed to pay an amount equivalent to the estimated cost of buttressing the dam approximately 49 million the california state coastal conservancy has committed to secure approximately 34 million from state federal and private foundation resources to fund the difference between the approximate cost of dam buttressing and the cost of the reroute and removal project in september 2010 cawc filed an application with the cpuc for authorization to implement the reroute and removal project and to recover through rates the 49 million in prospective costs associated with the reroute and removal project over a twentyyear period in addition cawc sought to recover certain historical costs totaling approximately 269 million related to studies to determine whether the dam could withstand a probable maximum flood and or maximum credible earthquake efforts to develop a project to address seismic issues the identification and analysis of possible alternative project options and activities undertaken pursuant to the directives of federal and state government agencies including dsod which is acting as the lead agency under the state and federal environmental review laws 

on june 21 2012 the cpuc issued a decision approving the reroute and removal project specifically the decision provides for rate recovery by cawc of the 49 million in prospective costs over a 20year period subject to an offset for tax benefits derived by cawc’s donation of specified parcels of land cawc may file an application with the cpuc to increase the amount of costs subject to rate recovery if project costs exceed 49 million in addition the decision permits cawc to earn its full rate of equity return on this investment by allowing cawc to draw interest at its authorized cost of capital which includes both the debt and equity rates set by the cpuc in addition the decision permits cawc’s rate recovery of approximately 27 million in historical costs the decision places all authorized and estimated costs in a regulatory assetbalancing account and provides for recovery of the regulatory assetbalancing account over a twentyyear period beginning july 1 2012 

on july 27 2012 the division of ratepayer advocates of the cpuc the “dra” filed an application for rehearing of the decision while supporting the reroute and removal project the dra challenged the portion of the decision authorizing cawc to earn a full rate of return on expenses of the dam project the cpuc has not yet ruled on the dra’s application on august 13 2012 cawc filed a response challenging the dra application the matter is pending 

other matters 

on june 29 2012 a pipe bridge that supported three pipes carrying raw and treated water to and from the new jersey american water “njaw” monmouth county swimming river treatment plant collapsed substantially reducing the plant’s capacity the bridge previously had suffered damage from hurricane irene in 2011 the plant provides approximately 50 of the total capacity needed to meet maximum daily demands for njaw’s coastal north system which serves approximately 95000 customers other sources provide the remaining capacity an estimated 200 customers at the highest elevations of the service area were without water service for approximately six hours on june 29 2012 and the drop in water pressure resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency by monmouth county and a precautionary boil water advisory for all customers served by the system njaw distributed 51000 cases of bottled water to its customers in the system emergency temporary piping across a road bridge was constructed and substantial capacities were restored by july 2 at which time all boil water advisories were lifted full plant capacity was restored on july 4 and the county lifted the state of emergency on july 9 

  

the bpu directed njaw to retain a special reliability master “srm” to conduct an investigation and present findings and recommendations to the bpu njaw cooperated fully with bpu staff and the srm throughout the course of the investigation the srm presented its report to the bpu on february 20 2013 the srm made 17 recommendations for improvement to overall system reliability seven of which had been identified by the company in its initial draft after action review prepared by njaw to document the actions it took to respond to the bridge collapse and its impacts as potential enhancements to njaw’s event management and response processes and procedures the company is in the process of implementing a number of the srm recommendations the bpu accepted the srm’s report for filing purposes only and noticed a 30 day public comment period that will end on march 22 2013 after the close of the public comment period the bpu will determine its responses to this matter we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter at this time 

periodically the company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations however litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance it is possible that some litigation and other proceedings could be decided unfavorably to us and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

executive overview 

general 

american water works company inc herein referred to as “american water” or the “company” is the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served our approximately 6700 employees provide drinking water wastewater and other water related services to an estimated 14 million people in more than 30 states and in two canadian provinces our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial industrial and other customers our regulated businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by state regulatory agencies in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters our regulated businesses provide services in 16 states and serves approximately 32 million customers based on the number of connections to our water and wastewater networks we report the results of these businesses in our regulated businesses segment we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state regulatory agencies we report the results of these businesses in our marketbased operations segment as noted under “business section” our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industrywide factors including but not limited to i economic utility regulation ii economic environment iii the need for infrastructure investment iv an overall trend of declining water usage per customer v weather and seasonality and vi access to and quality of water supply 

in 2012 we continued the execution of our strategic goals our commitment to operational excellence led to success in portfolio optimization improved regulated operating efficiency improved performance of our marketbased operations and enabled us to provide increased value to our customers and investors during the year we focused on executing our portfolio optimization actively addressing regulatory lag and declining usage continuing to make efficient use of capital and continuing to improve our regulated operation and maintenance “om” efficiency ratio also in 2012 we focused on the expansion of our marketbased operations particularly on the homeowner services group and military contract operations and on optimizing our municipal contract operations business model that is designed to provide value creation for both american water and the municipality 

2012 financial results 

all financial information in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda reflects only continuing operations in 2011 as part of our portfolio optimization initiative we entered into agreements to sell our regulated subsidiaries in arizona new mexico ohio and our regulated water and wastewater systems in texas the sale of our texas subsidiary’s assets was completed in june 2011 while the sales of our regulated subsidiaries in arizona new mexico and ohio were completed during 2012 additionally on december 13 2011 we completed the sale of applied water management inc which was part of our contract operations line of business within our marketbased segment therefore the financial results of all of these entities have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods unless 

  

otherwise noted see note 3 to consolidated financial statements for further details on our discontinued operations 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we continued to increase our net income while making significant capital investment in our infrastructure and implementing operational efficiency improvements necessary to offset increases in production and employee benefit costs aided by rate increases and favorable weather in the northeast and midwest regions of the united states most notably in june and july for the year ended december 31 2012 we generated 28769 million in total operating revenue and 3581 million in net income compared to total operating revenue of 26662 million and 3096 million in net income in 2011 our regulated businesses our largest operating segment generated 25644 million in operating revenue representing 891 of our consolidated operating revenue compared to 23689 million in operating revenues representing 888 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2011 this increase of 83 in operating revenues when compared to 2011 was primarily due to rate increases and increased sales volume in all customer classes in 2012 additionally for the year ended december 31 2012 our marketbased operations generated 3303 million in operating revenue compared to 3278 million in operating revenues in 2011 an increase of 08 

net income from continuing operations was 3743 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to net income from continuing operations of 3049 million for the year ended december 31 2011 diluted earnings from continuing operations per average common share was 211 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 173 for year ended december 31 2011 for the year ended december 31 2012 we reported net income of 3581 million or diluted earnings per share of 201 compared to net income of 3096 million or diluted eps of 175 for the comparable period in 2011 net income for 2012 includes income tax charges of 65 million or 004 diluted loss per share resulting from the divestiture of our arizona new mexico and ohio subsidiaries in addition we generated increased cash flows from operations during 2012 of 9556 million compared to 8084 million in 2011 

the primary factors contributing to the increase in net income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2012 were increased revenues resulting from rate increases and higher customer usage as well as slightly higher revenues in our marketbased operations segment partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense and general taxes see “consolidated results of operations and variances” and “segment results” below for further detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations as well as our business segments 

implementation of portfolio optimization initiative 

in 2012 we continued to execute our plan for optimizing our portfolio in january 2012 we completed the sale of regulated operations in arizona and new mexico net proceeds after all postclose adjustments amounted to 4589 million in may 2012 we completed the divestiture of our ohio subsidiary the net proceeds after all postclose adjustments totaled 1022 million 

during 2012 the company closed on ten acquisitions of various regulated water and wastewater systems for a total aggregate purchase price of 446 million included in this amount is the acquisition of seven regulated water systems in new york for a purchase price of 367 million plus assumed liabilities this acquisition added approximately 50000 water customers to our regulated operations effective august 17 2012 the new york state public service commission approved a plan to merge these seven regulated water systems with and into our long island subsidiary which was then renamed new york american water company 

capital investments 

we invested approximately 929 million and 925 million in companyfunded capital improvements in 2012 and 2011 respectively these capital investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations renew aging treatment and network assets provide capacity for new growth and ensure 

  

system reliability security and quality of service the need for continuous investment presents a challenge due to the potential for regulatory lag or the delay in recovering our operating expenses and earning an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital in conjunction with our capital program management continued its focus on reducing regulatory lag during 2012 for 2013 we anticipate spending approximately 950 million on companyfunded capital investments including expenditures associated with our business transformation project 

on august 1 2012 our new business systems associated with phase i of our business transformation project became operational phase i consisted of the rollout of the enterprise resource planning systems “erp” which encompasses applications that handle human resources finance and supply chainprocurement management activities phase ii consists of the rollout of a new enterprise asset management system which will manage an asset’s lifecycle and a customer information system which will contain all billing and data pertaining to american water’s customers for our regulated segment phase ii is expected to be substantially complete by december 31 2013 through december 31 2012 we have spent 2578 million including afudc on this business transformation project with 1181 of that amount spent in 2012 

rate cases and regulatory matters 

in 2012 we received authorizations for additional annualized revenues from general rate cases totaling 1231 million during 2012 rate cases were approved for our california illinois indiana iowa missouri new jersey new york tennessee and virginia subsidiaries also in 2012 we were granted 184 million in additional annualized revenues assuming constant sales volumes from infrastructure charges in several of our states and in july 2012 our california cost of capital application was approved on january 1 2013 additional annualized revenue of 65 million resulting from infrastructure charges in our pennsylvania subsidiary became effective 

other regulatory activities occurring in 2012 that allow us to address regulatory lag include the passing of legislation by the general assembly in pennsylvania which expanded the use of infrastructure replacement programs to wastewater systems and the rules adopted by the new jersey board of public utilities in the second quarter of 2012 that allow the implementation of a distribution system improvement charge for specified water infrastructure investments on july 20 2012 our new jersey subsidiary submitted a foundational filing for this charge and our filing was approved on october 23 2012 

as of february 21 2013 we are awaiting final orders in two states requesting additional annualized revenue of approximately 369 million 

continue improvement in om efficiency ratio for our regulated businesses 

our om efficiency ratio a nongaap measure is defined as our regulated operation and maintenance expense divided by regulated operating revenues where both om expense and operating revenues are adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense we have modified for all periods presented our om efficiency ratio to exclude the allocable portion of nonom support services cost mainly depreciation and general taxes that are reflected in the regulated businesses segment as om costs but for consolidated financial reporting purposes are categorized within other lines in the statement of operations management believes that this modified calculation better reflects the regulated businesses segment’s om efficiency ratio our om efficiency ratio was 401 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to 424 and 442 for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively we evaluate our operating performance using this measure as it is the primary measure of the efficiency of our regulated operations this information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance om efficiency ratio is not a measure defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report the following table provides a reconciliation between operation and maintenance expense and operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap and to 

  

those amounts utilized in the calculation of our om efficiency ratio for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010

 growing our marketbased operations 

in august 2012 our homeowner services group “hos” was selected by the new york city water board as the official service line protection provider to homeowners hos will make services available to an estimated 650000 homeowners throughout the city’s five boroughs also during the third quarter of 2012 hos announced that it is expanding the number of communities in which it provides water and sewer line protection programs to homeowners in connecticut indiana michigan and ohio 

other matters 

in september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement we implemented our “last best and final” offer on january 1 2011 in order to provide health care coverage for our employees in accordance with the terms of the offer the unions have challenged our right to implement our last best and final offer in this regard following the filing by the utility workers union of america of an unfair labor practice charge the nlrb issued a complaint against us in january 2012 claiming that we implemented the last best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the federal mediation and conciliation service a state mediation agency and several state departments of labor we have asserted that we did in fact provide sufficient notice 

on october 16 2012 the nlrb administrative law judge hearing the matter ruled that although we did provide sufficient notification to the federal mediation and conciliation service we did not provide notice to 

  

state agencies in violation of the national labor relations act the administrative law judge ordered among other things that we cease and desist from implementing the terms of our last best and final offer and make whole all affected employees for losses suffered as a result of our implementation of our last best and final offer the “make whole” order if upheld on appeal would require us to provide backpay plus interest from january 1 2011 through the date of the final determination based on current estimates and assumptions we estimate the cash impact could be in the range of 25 to 35 million per year with the total impact dependent on the length of time the issue remains unresolved on november 2012 we filed an exception to the decision of the administrative law judge in order to obtain a review by the full nlrb 

2013 and beyond 

our strategy for the future will continue to focus on customers expansion through targeted growth environmental sustainability and regulatory and public policy we will also continue to modernize our infrastructure and to focus on operational efficiencies while bolstering a culture of continuous improvement 

in 2013 we will continue to focus on our customers by achieving established customer satisfaction and service quality targets we will expand our regulated business segment through focused acquisitions andor organic growth while expanding in our marketbased segment from new core growth expanded markets and new offerings in regards to environmental sustainability we are committed to maximizing our protection of the environment reducing our carbon and waste footprints and water lost through leakage we will drive appropriate legislative and regulatory policy changes by actively addressing regulatory lag that impacts return on our investments and promoting constructive regulatory frameworks we expect to file up to four general rate cases as well as file for infrastructure surcharges additionally we expect as part of our general rate case filings or separate filings to seek appropriate passthrough mechanisms and forwardlooking adjustments or mechanisms that recognize declining usage 

in 2013 we expect to invest approximately 950 million to upgrade our infrastructure and systems we also expect to continue to improve our regulated om efficiency ratio and expect to meet or exceed the fiveyear goal we established in 2011 to be below 40 one to two years early a significant component in both the capital and om efficiency objectives is to optimize our supply chain process to provide more value for each dollar of capital and om spent we anticipate completing phase ii of our business transformation and continue to close the gap between our allowed and our earned regulated return we are committed to operating our business responsibly and managing our operating and capital costs in a manner that serves our customers and produces value for our shareholders we are committed to an ongoing strategy that leverages processes and technology innovation to make ourselves more effective and efficient 

  

consolidated results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 comparison of consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

operating revenues consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 2107 million or 79 compared to the same period in 2011 this increase is the result of higher revenues in our regulated businesses of 1955 million which was mainly attributable to rate increases and increased sales volumes primarily related to weather for further information see the respective “operating revenues” discussions within the “segment results” 

  

operation and maintenance  consolidated operation and maintenance expense for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 482 million or 37 compared to 2011 this change was mainly attributable to a 374 million increase in our regulated businesses costs primarily related to an increase in production costs of approximately 122 million to support higher customer demand as well as incremental contracted services costs attributable to various projects in support of improving processes and operating efficiency and effectiveness including the support of the golive of our enterprise resource planning system and the use of temporary labor to backfill positions including those positions vacated by employees assigned to our business transformation project also contributing to the increase was a 70 million contribution made in 2012 to the american water charitable foundation a 501c3 organization for further information see the respective “operation and maintenance” discussions within the “segment results” 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 297 million or 84 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of additional utility plant placed in service 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by 107 million or 51 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 this increase was principally due to higher property taxes of 73 million most of which is the result of incremental taxes associated with our new york acquisition 

other income expenses other expenses decreased 57 million or 19 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in the prior year this decrease is attributable to an increase in allowance for funds used during construction “afudc” of 43 million resulting from increased construction activity including our business transformation project and a decrease in interest expense net of interest income of 16 million 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 583 million or 293 to 2570 million for the year ended december 31 2012 the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 were 407 and 395 respectively the rate for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 includes a 45 million tax benefit related to one of our operating companies contributing nonutility property to a county authority within its operating area 

income loss from discontinued operations net of tax as noted above the financial results of our regulated water and wastewater systems in arizona new mexico texas and ohio and our applied water management inc subsidiary within the marketbased operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented the loss in 2012 is primarily comprised of net losses recorded in connection with the disposition of our arizona new mexico and ohio subsidiaries the 2011 income amount reflects the operations for the discontinued subsidiaries and an aftertax benefit of 151 million related to the cessation of depreciation for our arizona new mexico and texas subsidiaries under gaap operations that are considered discontinued cease to depreciate their assets partially offsetting the 2011 income from discontinued operations net of tax amount was 251 million after tax writedowns recorded in 2011 to reduce the net asset values of certain of our discontinued operations 

net income net income for 2012 was 3581 million compared to 3096 million for 2011 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

comparison of consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

operating revenues consolidated operating revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 1112 million or 44 compared to the same period in 2010 contributing to this increase were higher revenues in our regulated businesses of 832 million which were mainly the result of rate increases and higher revenues in our marketbased operations segment of 331 million which were primarily due to a 223 million increase in the contract operations group revenues attributable to incremental capital project activity associated with our military services contracts for further information see the respective “operating revenues” discussions within the “segment results” 

  

operation and maintenance  consolidated operation and maintenance expense for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 109 million or 08 compared to 2010 this change was driven by a 217 million increase in our marketbased operations segment primarily related to the increased capital activity associated with our military contracts partially offset by a 28 million decrease in our regulated businesses segment the remaining 81 million decrease was mainly due to additional expenses in 2010 attributable to a 50 million contribution to the american water charitable foundation a 501c3 organization that was established in december 2010 to encourage and support employees’ volunteerism and community giving and severance costs of 27 million associated with changes in certain senior management positions for further information see the respective “operation and maintenance” discussions within the “segment results” 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 216 million or 65 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of additional utility plant placed in service 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by 49 million or 24 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was principally due to higher gross receipts taxes of 46 million primarily in our new jersey regulated subsidiary 

other income expenses other income expenses increased 08 million or 03 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year this increase is attributable to an increase in allowance for funds used during construction “afudc” of 42 million resulting from increased construction activity and a decrease in interest expense net of interest income of 14 million partially offset by a decrease in other net the decrease in other net of 58 million is mainly due to the inclusion in 2010 of the release of the remaining balance of a loss reserve amounting to 13 million resulting from the resolution of the outstanding issues and uncertainties incremental rental revenues of 26 million and the recognition of funds received related to the methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” legal settlement for 19 million resulting from the outcome of a subsidiary’s rate order 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 244 million or 140 to 1988 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 were 395 and 406 respectively the rate for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 includes a 45 million tax benefit related to one of our operating companies contributing nonutility property to a county authority within its operating area 

income from discontinued operations net of tax as noted above the financial results of our regulated water and wastewater systems in arizona new mexico texas and ohio and our applied water management inc subsidiary within the marketbased operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented the decrease in income from discontinued operations net of tax is primarily related to a 251 million charge recorded to reduce the net asset values of those businesses classified as discontinued operation which included associated parent company goodwill to their net realizable values this charge was offset by a benefit of 151 million related to the cessation of depreciation for our arizona new mexico texas and ohio subsidiaries in accordance with gaap for the year ended december 31 2011 

net income net income for 2011 was 3096 million compared to 2678 million for 2010 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

segment results of operations 

we have two operating segments which are also our reportable segments the regulated businesses and the marketbased operations these segments are determined based on how we assess performance and allocate resources we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocated resources based on several factors with the primary measure being income from continuing operations before income taxes certain 2011 and 2010 operations and maintenance expense categories have been reclassified to conform to the 2012 presentation 

  

regulated businesses segment 

the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated businesses for the periods indicated 

 

 operating revenues our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide services to residential commercial industrial and other customers this business is subject to state regulation and our results of operations can be impacted significantly by rates authorized by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate the table below details additional annualized revenues awarded including step increases and assuming a constant volume resulting from rate authorizations granted in 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 

   the effective dates for the more significant increases granted in 2012 were january 1 2012 april 1 2012 may 1 2012 and october 1 2012 for our california missouri new jersey and illinois subsidiaries respectively the effective date for the 2011 pennsylvania rate increase was november 11 2011 the 2011 increase in virginia was effective in march 2011 while the tennessee and west virginia increases were effective in april 2011 the effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2010 were october 1 2010 july 1 2010 april 23 2010 and may 3 2010 in kentucky missouri illinois and indiana respectively rate increases granted in 2010 for pennsylvania and new jersey were not effective until january 1 2011 

  

as previously noted an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs such as mechanisms that permit a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure the following table details additional annualized revenue authorized through infrastructure surcharge mechanisms which were granted in 2012 2011 and 2010 as these surcharges are typically rolled into the new base rates and therefore are reset to zero when new base rates are effective certain of these charges may also be reflected in the total general rate case amounts awarded in the table above if the order date was following the infrastructure surcharge filing date 

 

 comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

operating revenues increased by 1955 million or 83 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 the increase in revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through rate authorizations for a number of our operating companies of which the impact was approximately 1287 million and higher consumption in our midwest and certain northeastern states in 2012 compared to 2011 which amounted to an increase of approximately 391 million the increased consumption is primarily attributable to the warmerdrier weather in our midwestern and certain of our northeastern states in the second and third quarters of 2012 lastly revenues were higher by 267 million as a result revenues from newly acquired systems with the most significant being our new york acquisition in the second quarter of 2012 the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and billed water sales volume by customer class 

 

  

the following discussion related to water services indicates the increase or decrease in the regulated businesses’ revenues and associated billed water sales volumes in gallons by customer class 

  

water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for the year ended december 31 2012 totaled 14686 million a 1292 million increase or 96 over the same period of 2011 mainly due to rate increases as well as increased sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers increased by 50 for the year ended december 31 2012 to 1899 billion gallons from 1809 billion gallons for the same period in 2011 we believe this higher consumption is attributable to the warmerdrier weather in our northeastern and midwestern operating states as compared to the prior year also contributing to the increased sales volume was the additional consumption resulting from our new york acquisition 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for the year ended december 31 2012 increased by 441 million or 93 to 5183 million for the same period in 2011 these increases were mainly due to rate increases and increased sales volume the volume of water sold to commercial customers increased by 41 for the year ended december 31 2012 to 848 billion gallons from 815 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2011 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers totaled 1284 million for the year ended december 31 2012 an increase of 124 million or 107 from those recorded for the same period of 2011 mainly due to rate increases in addition to a slight increase in sales volume the volume of water sold to industrial customers totaled 394 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2012 an increase of 03 from the 393 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2011

other water revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 decreased by 100 million or 481 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to a reduction in the water revenue adjustment mechanism in our california subsidiary 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 9 states revenues from these services increased by 19 million or 24 to 782 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from the same period of 2011 the increase was primarily attributable to rate increases in a number of our operating companies 

other revenues —other revenues include such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees certain rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly due to the receipt of insurance proceeds related to business interruption for our joplin missouri service area which was affected by tornados in 2011 

  

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 374 million or 34 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 operation and maintenance expense for 2012 and 2011 by major expense category were as follows 

 

 production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal costs increased by 122 million or 47 for 2012 compared to 2011 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 overall production costs increased for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the prior year mainly as a result of increased purchased water costs attributable to increased production resulting from higher consumption in most of our subsidiaries with more significant increases occurring in our california and illinois subsidiaries for 2011 our california subsidiary’s customer needs were met without the need for purchased water 

employeerelated costs including salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense decreased 178 million or 36 for 2012 compared to 2011 these employeerelated costs represented 418 and 448 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2012 and 2011 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table 

 

 the overall decrease in employeerelated costs was primarily attributable to decreased salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense the decrease in salaries and wages was primarily due to higher capitalization rates due to increased capital investment and a reduction in headcount as a result of organizational 

  

streamlining and vacancies some of which have been backfilled with temporary labor and therefore included within contracted services in the operating supplies and services category below partially offsetting the decrease was higher costs resulting from wage increases higher stockbased compensation expense as well as increased costs due to the addition of employees from our new york acquisition the reduction in group insurance expense is mainly attributable to lower headcount as a result of vacancies a decrease in the overall cost per person as well as higher capitalization rates the decrease in pension expense was primarily due to decreased contributions in certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on our funding policy which is to fund at least the greater of the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 or the normal cost 

operating supplies and services include expenses for office operation legal and other professional services including transportation expenses information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges overall these costs increased 237 million or 127 for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 

 

 the overall increase in operating supplies and services was primarily due to increased contracted services and higher other operating supplies and services the contracted services increase was mainly due to incremental costs associated with the backfilling of positions including those vacated by employees who are assigned to our business transformation project the use of contractors for other specific projects the intent of which is to improve processes and operating efficiency and effectiveness over the longterm and lastly additional costs resulting from the rollout and stabilization of our erp in the third quarter of 2012 the increase in the other operating supplies and services costs is primarily related to the rollout and stabilization of the erp in addition to incremental expenses associated with our new york acquisition of 11 million and an increase of 15 million for community relations and customer education in order to communicate the importance of water conservation additionally 2011 included a reduction of 22 million for an anticipated insurance recovery of expenses incurred as a result of severe weather storms in particular hurricane irene which is partially offset by a reduction recorded in 2012 of 10 million in anticipated insurance recovery of expenses incurred as a result of hurricane sandy partially offsetting the increase in other operating supplies and services was a 21 million credit adjustment recorded in 2012 resulting from the finalization of rate decisions in california 

maintenance materials and services which includes emergency repair as well as costs for preventive maintenance increased 80 million or 109 for 2012 compared to 2011 

 

 the increase of 80 million in 2012 is mainly attributable to increased preventive maintenance expenses throughout our regulated subsidiaries including hydrant and tank painting meter testing pump tank and well maintenance and paving costs 

  

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 65 million or 153 for 2012 compared to 2011 

 

 the increase in the uncollectible accounts expense was mainly the result of a refinement to our allowance for uncollectible calculation based on more detailed data trends which were derived in conjunction with the development of our new customer information system 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 47 million or 127 for 2012 compared to 2011 

 

 insurance costs were higher compared to 2011 as 2012 insurance reflected incremental expense resulting from the resolution of prior years’ claims regulatory expenses increased in 2012 as a result of the inclusion in 2011 of a deferral of previously expensed costs in one of our subsidiaries 

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2012 is primarily due to the higher om expenses as explained above as well as higher depreciation and amortization expense of 281 million resulting from additional utility plant placed in service and increased general taxes of 100 million principally attributable to higher property taxes relating to our new york acquisition 

income from continuing operations before income taxes the 1137 million increase for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in the prior year is the result of the aforementioned operating revenue and operating expenses variations 

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

operating revenues increased by 832 million or 36 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the increase in revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through rate authorizations for a number of our operating companies of which the impact was approximately 1338 million partially offset by decreased revenues of 570 million attributable to decreased consumption in 2011 compared to 2010 the majority of this decrease occurred in our new jersey and pennsylvania subsidiaries mainly as a result of the extreme weather conditions including the impacts associated with hurricane irene and other severe 

  

storms in the northeast region of the united states during the third quarter of 2011 the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and billed water sales volume by customer class 

 

  

the following discussion related to water services indicates the increase or decrease in the regulated businesses’ revenues and associated billed water sales volumes in gallons by customer class 

water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for year ended december 31 2011 totaled 13394 million a 393 million increase or 30 over the same period of 2010 mainly due to rate increases offset by decreases in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers decreased by 33 for the year ended december 31 2011 to 1809 billion gallons from 1871 billion gallons for the same period in 2010 we believe that factors contributing to the decline could include the aforementioned weather conditions in the third quarter 2011 an increased customer focus on conservation the use of more efficient appliances and the current economic climate the extent to which these items individually contribute to the overall decline is difficult to measure 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by 172 million or 38 to 4742 million for the same period in 2010 these increases were mainly due to rate increases partially offset by decreases in sales volume the volume of water sold to commercial customers decreased by 31 for the year ended december 31 2011 to 815 billion gallons from 841 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2010 we believe that factors contributing to this decline include wetter weather conditions an increased customer focus on conservation as well as the current economic environment in certain areas in which we operate similar to the above the extent to which these items individually contribute to the overall decline is difficult to measure 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers totaled 1160 million for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 58 million or 53 from those recorded for the same period of 2010 mainly due to rate increases offset by a slight decrease in sales volume the volume of water sold to industrial customers totaled 393 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2011 a decrease of 15 from the 399 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2010

other water revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 decreased by 20 million or 86 primarily due to a reduction in the water revenue adjustment mechanism in our california subsidiary compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 9 states revenues from these services increased by 73 million or 105 to 763 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from the same period of 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to rate increases in a number of our operating companies

 production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal decreased by 60 million or 22 for 2011 compared to 2010 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 the decrease in our fuel and power costs was primarily due to the decreased water sales volumes the decrease in purchased water is primarily attributable to the decreased usage most notably in our new jersey subsidiary due to wet weather conditions as previously discussed as well as in our california subsidiary as customer needs were met with internally produced water the decrease in chemical costs is due to higher consumption in 2010 as a result of much drier and warmer weather in the northeast region of the united states we also experienced favorable pricing in some of our operating companies in 2011 the waste disposal cost decrease was mainly due to the recognition in 2010 of 19 million of previously deferred costs allowed by a cost recovery mechanism in one of our operating companies 

  

employeerelated costs including salaries and wages group insurance and pension expense increased 29 million or 06 for 2011 compared to 2010 these employeerelated costs represented 448 and 445 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2011 and 2010 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table 

 

 the overall increase in employeerelated costs was primarily driven by increased pension expense the increase in pension expense for the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to increased contributions in certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs and revenue requirements are based on the actual cash contributions to our pension trust account this increase was partially offset by lower salaries and wages and group insurance expenses the decrease in salaries and wages for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by vacant positions and lower severance expenses partially offset by increased incentive costs and annual wage increases group insurance decreased mainly due to lower postretirement benefits other than pension as the result of changes to the design of our medical plan and vacant positions as compared to the same period in the prior year 

operating supplies and services include expenses for office operation legal and other professional services including transportation expenses information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges overall these costs increased 62 million or 34 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 

 

 the above increases are primarily due to higher contracted services of 68 million for the year ended december 31 2011 mainly as a result of backfilling positions including those left open by employees transferring to our business transformation project as well as the use of contractors for other specific projects additionally 2011 included the recording of an anticipated recovery of expenses related to costs incurred as a result of severe weather storms primarily hurricane irene which have been recorded in their respective expense lines also contributing to the increase was the fact that the same period in 2010 included a reversal of a 35 million payment previously made by our california operating company to the california department of fish and game “cdfg” on behalf of the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration “noaa” this reversal was the result of an advice letter issued by the california public utility commission which allowed for rate recovery of such payment 

  

maintenance materials and services which includes emergency repair as well as costs for preventive maintenance decreased 27 million or 36 for 2012 compared to 2011 

 

 the decrease of 27 million in 2011 is mainly attributable to lower preventive maintenance expenses throughout our regulated subsidiaries including tank painting meter testing pump tank and well maintenance and paving costs 

customer billing and accounting expenses decreased by 05 million or 12 for 2011 compared to 2010 

 

 the decrease of 20 million in the uncollectible accounts expense was the result of improved collection in our receivables in excess of 120 days this decrease is partially offset by the increase in the other category mainly due to an increase in collection agency fees 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs decreased by 26 million or 66 for 2011 compared to 2010 

 

 the decrease in regulatory expenses was mainly driven by rate case expenses which were deferred in one of our subsidiaries 

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 is primarily due to higher depreciation expense of 205 million resulting from additional utility plant placed in service and increased general taxes of 50 million principally attributable to higher gross receipts taxes in our new jersey regulated subsidiary offsetting these increases is lower operation and maintenance expense as explained above 

income from continuing operations before income taxes the 568 million increase for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year is the result of the aforementioned operating revenue and operating expenses variations

 production costs are comprised of fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal costs the overall decrease in production costs is mainly attributable to decreased fuel and purchased power as well as chemical costs for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the cessation of costs related to contracts that terminated and expired during 2010 

employeerelated costs including salaries and wages group insurance and other employee benefits decreased 56 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the decrease in these costs for the year ended december 31 2011 is primarily due to lower expenses related to expired and terminated contracts partially offset by increased costs associated with our military contracts additionally costs were also lower due to reduced headcount attributable to both eliminated as well as vacant positions compared to the same period in 2010 

operating supplies and services consist primarily of contracted services and expenses of office operation legal and other professional services transportation expenses as well as information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges the increase in these expenses in 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily attributable to the higher expenses associated with our contract operations group which is related to the increased activity with our military construction projects corresponding with the increase in revenues partially offset by lower expenses due to expired and terminated contracts

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures our business is very capital intensive and requires significant capital resources a majority of these capital resources is provided by internally generated cash flows from operations when necessary we obtain additional funds from external sources in the debt and equity capital markets and through bank borrowings our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets if these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms we have access to an unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of 1 billion we rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to back our commercial paper program disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets see “—credit facility and shortterm debt” 

in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we through american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary issue commercial paper which is supported by the revolving credit facility awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 329 million of outstanding letters of credit under its credit facility as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 awcc had 9671 million available under our credit facility that we can use to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and back our 2700 million outstanding commercial paper we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated operating companies receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines 

we use our capital resources including cash to i fund capital requirements including construction expenditures ii pay off maturing debt iii pay dividends iv fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and v invest in new and existing ventures we spend a significant amount of cash on construction projects that we expect to have a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag see “business—regulation—economic regulation” we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and to the extent available cash flows from operations since we continue to make investments equal to or greater than our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

  

we believe that our ability to access the capital markets our revolving credit facility and our cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our shortterm requirements we fund liquidity needs for capital investment working capital and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations public and private debt offerings commercial paper markets and to the extent necessary our revolving credit facility we believe we have sufficient liquidity and ability to manage our expenditures should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets 

in addition the company can delay major capital investments or other funding requirement or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are generally greater during the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by among other things economic utility regulation infrastructure investment inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining per customer usage of water weather and seasonality and overall economic conditions 

cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditures requirements we will seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed there can be no assurance that we will be able to access such markets successfully on favorable terms or at all operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated 

 

  

  the increase in cash flows from operations for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the same period in 2011 is primarily attributable to additional revenues in 2012 and lower pension and postretirement healthcare contributions 

  

the increase in cash flows from operations for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 is primarily attributable to additional revenues in 2011 offset by the receipt of a tax refund in the first half of 2010 that did not occur in 2011 

the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 951 million in 2013 of which 301 million was already made in 2013 in addition we estimate that contributions will amount to 734 million in 2014 834 million in 2015 927 million in 2016 and 951 million in 2017 actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and actual investment returns 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows for the periods indicated 

 

  

 the variance from 2011 to 2012 in cash flows used in investing is mainly attributable to the cash proceeds received from the sale of our arizona and new mexico subsidiaries in january 2012 partially offset by cash proceeds used for acquisition purposes with the largest being the acquisition of additional regulated water and wastewater operations in new york 

cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2011 which is attributable to the construction of and replacement of certain treatment facilities and infrastructure in our pennsylvania subsidiary as well as increased capital spending associated with our business transformation project as we moved into its design and build phase 

we estimate that business transformation project expenditures could be in the range of 280 million prior to any afudc allowed through december 31 2012 including afudc of 174 million capital expenditures amount to 2571 million on the project with 1173 million spent in 2012 as with any other initiative of this magnitude there are risks that could result in increased costs any technical difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative such as implementing a successful change management process may result in delays which in turn may increase the costs of the project and also delay and perhaps reduce any cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the initiative when we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure while we believe such expenditures can be recovered through regulated rates we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely rate recovery of these increased costs associated with this transformation project any such delays or difficulties encountered with such recovery may have a material and adverse impact on our business customer relationships and financial results 

as previously noted in 2013 we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total approximately 950 million for years in the foreseeable future beyond 2013 we estimate that such investment will be between 800 million and 1 billion annually we intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base while working with regulators in the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment 

  

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures 

 

 capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2012 increased by 37 million or 04 compared to 2011 mainly as a result of an increase in the replacement of transmissiondistribution infrastructure and higher business transformation project expenditures partially offset by a reduction in treatment and pumping expenditures due to the completion of certain water treatment plant projects for which major expenditures occurred in 2011 capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by 1592 million or 208 compared to 2010 mainly as a result of the increased business transformation project expenditures of 774 million and increased treatment and pumping expenditures of 583 million as a result of certain water treatment plants projects in our pennsylvania new jersey and indiana subsidiaries one avenue to seek growth is through tuckins by helping commissions with troubled water systems as well as other acquisitions that are complementary to our existing business and support the continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt or equity offerings 

the following provides a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities in the years indicated 

2012 

 

  

 2011 

 

   

 2010 

 

 our investing activities could require considerable capital resources which we have generated through operations and attained through financing activities we can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc we intend to access capital markets on a regular basis subject to market conditions 

in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds this amounted to 319 million 223 million and 70 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

on may 4 2012 we and awcc filed a universal shelf registration statement that enabled us to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities including common stock preferred stock and debt securities all subject to market demand and ratings status during 2012 300 million of debt securities were issued pursuant to this filing 

in regards to debt financings the following longterm debt was issued in 2012 

 

  

   also in the second quarter of 2012 and in connection with the acquisition of our additional subsidiaries in new york we assumed debt of 252 million with coupon rates of 500 to 600 and maturity dates ranging from 2015 to 2035 in september 2012 we redeemed 109 million of these outstanding bonds with original maturity dates of 2031 to 2035 and interest rates ranging from 500 to 600 

  

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2012 

 

 included in the longterm debt redemptionsretirements is 42 million related to our previously held ohio subsidiary which was classified in discontinued operations prior to its divestiture 

the following longterm debt was issued in 2011 

 

 the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2011 

 

   

the following longterm debt was issued in 2010 

 

  

note private activity type defined as private activity bonds and government funded debt 

           

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2010 

 

 from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements via tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

credit facility and shortterm debt 

the components of shortterm debt were as follows 

 

 prior to entering into a new credit facility in late 2012 awcc maintained an 840 million senior unsecured credit facility syndicated among a group of 10 banks this revolving credit facility was principally used to support the commercial paper program at awcc and to provide up to 1500 million in letters of credit on september 15 2012 1550 million of this senior unsecured revolving credit facility expired leaving 6850 million of commitments under this facility on october 29 2012 we terminated this agreement and entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with 1 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of 14 banks this new facility will mature on october 29 2017 subject to up to two 1year extensions at our request interest rates on advances under the new facility are based on a credit spread to the eurodollar rate or base rate with the credit spread of 100 through june 2012 and then based on the higher of awcc’s moody’s investors service which we refer to as moody’s or standard  poor’s ratings services which we refer to as sp credit rating at current ratings that spread would be 1075 consistent with the old facility this new facility unless otherwise extended requires the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 similar to the old facility the new facility will be principally used to support awcc’s commercial paper program and to provide up to 1500 million in letters of credit 

we closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with this credit facility in accordance with the credit agreement no financial institution can have more than 2500 million of the aggregate commitment through the facility expiration date of october 29 2017 if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances the company may request the other lenders to assume the defaulting lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment however the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender’s commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to replace a defaulting lender 

  

the following table provides information as of december 31 2012 and 2011 regarding the respective credit facility in effect at the time letters of credit sublimits and available funds under those revolving credit facilities as well as outstanding amounts of commercial paper and outstanding borrowings under the respective facilities 

 

 awcc had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and 276 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 21 2013 also as of february 21 2013 awcc had 2951 million of commercial paper outstanding 

the weightedaverage interest rate on shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 was approximately 049 and 041 respectively 

capital structure 

the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 the changes in the capital structure between periods were mainly attributable to changes in outstanding commercial paper balances the increase in 2011 was the result of funding the majority of 2011 cash requirements with commercial paper as a result of anticipating the proceeds from the divestiture of our arizona and new mexico regulated businesses in 2012 we used the net proceeds from the sale to pay down commercial paper in 2012 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue debt or access our revolving credit lines we were in compliance with our covenants as of december 31 2012 longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things limit the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions 

certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2012 our ratio was 056 to 100 and therefore we were in compliance with the ratio 

  

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets is directly affected by securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets we primarily access the capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we also issue debt at our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities to lower our overall cost of debt 

on august 14 2012 moody’s changed its rating outlook to positive from stable and affirmed its “baa2” corporate credit rating for both awcc and american water and its “p2” commercial paper rating for awcc on june 18 2012 sp revised its rating outlook for american water and awcc to positive from stable in addition on january 30 2012  sp reaffirmed its “bbb” corporate credit rating on awcc and american water and awcc’s “a2” commercial rating 

the following table shows the company’s securities ratings as of december 31 2012 

 

 a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flow is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facility 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance which could include a demand that we provide collateral to secure our obligations we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend practice to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends rather than retaining that cash for other purposes we expect that dividends will be paid quarterly to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock will not be cumulative only declared dividends will be paid 

during 2012 2011 and 2010 we paid 2135 million 1579 million and 1503 million in dividends respectively for 2012 we paid a dividend of 025 per share on december 28 december 3 and september 3 and 023 per share on june 1 and march 1 the december 28 2012 cash dividend payment of 025 per share would have historically been paid in march 2013 however the board approved accelerating the payment date to 2012 to take advantage of the existing 2012 tax rates for 2011 we paid a dividend of 023 per share on december 1 

  

and september 1 and 022 per share on june 1 and march 1 for 2010 we paid a dividend of 022 per share on december 1 and september 1 and 021 per share on june 1 and march 1 

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt or equity securities at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business these financial obligations as of december 31 2012 are set forth in the table below 

 

 note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our marketbased operations are not included in the above amounts 

 

    

       publicprivate partnerships 

west virginiaamerican water company which we refer to as wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

wvawc leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities which is presented within utility plant was approximately 1586 million at december 31 2012 

performance obligations 

we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2060 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenues of 19340 million at december 31 2012 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2013 and 2048 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 10184 million at december 31 2012 some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

  

our financial condition results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we account for these regulated operations in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements use of the authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria 1 thirdparty regulation of rates 2 costbased rates and 3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates as of december 31 2012 we had concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as a onetime extraordinary item and continued impacts on our operating activities 

regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow for recovery through rates charged to customers regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred as of december 31 2012 we have recorded 11991 million of net regulatory assets within our consolidated financial statements also at december 31 2012 we had recorded 3642 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our statement of operations and financial position could be materially affected 

goodwill 

the company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan at december 31 2012 the company’s goodwill was 12073 million the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

in september 2011 the fasb issued revised guidance intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment the amendments allow an entity first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on a qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount the amendments were effective for 

  

annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 and early adoption was permitted 

the company decided to adopt this new guidance for its 2012 annual test and applied the qualitative test “step 0” or “step 0 test” to its reporting units for the annual impairment test performed as of november 30 2012 

the company completed a quantitative fair value measurement of its reporting units when performing its prior year goodwill impairment analysis on november 30 2011 as of the 2011 testing date a quantitative assessment was made and implied that the fair value of its reporting units was well in excess of their carrying amount and no impairment was required 

in the current year qualitative step 0 test at november 30 2012 after assessing various events and circumstances that would affect the estimated fair value of the reporting units in its base line november 30 2011 test the company has determined that it is not required to calculate the fair value of its reporting units at november 30 2012 the company has determined that it is more likely than not that its reporting unit fair values are greater than the reporting unit carrying values and no impairment is necessary 

on a periodic basis or in the case of a triggering event the company will use the twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values including goodwill on the measurement date if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge 

for the year ended december 31 2012 no impairment charge was recorded for the year ended december 31 2011 no impairment charge was recorded for our continuing operations in 2011 we recorded a charge to goodwill of 255 million relating to parent company goodwill associated with businesses classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2010 no impairment charge was recorded 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment 

  

whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period unbilled utility revenues as of december 31 2012 and 2011 were 1806 million and 1854 million respectively increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and favorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue however since the majority of our customers are billed on a monthly basis total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged 

revenue from marketbased operations is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

accounting for income taxes 

the parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for united states tax purposes members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns 

  

certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes the company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements these deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse in addition the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences previously flowed through to customers reverse 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations benefits under the plans are based on the employee’s years of service and compensation the pension plans have been closed for most employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 had their accrued benefit frozen and will be able to receive this benefit as a lump sum upon termination or retirement union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2006 will be provided with a 525 of base pay defined contribution plan we also maintain other postretirement benefit plans which provide varying levels of medical and life insurance for eligible retirees these retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 the company also has several unfunded noncontributory supplemental nonqualified pension plans that provide additional retirement benefits to certain employees the company does not participate in a multiemployer plan see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices at year end 2011 we began using an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds the yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount 

  

rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 417 502 and 532 at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 416 505 and 527 at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 775 for 2012 and 790 for both 2011 and 2010 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 741 for 2012 and 760 for 2011 and 2010 

the asset allocations for the company’s us pension plan at december 31 2012 and 2011 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocations for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2012 and 2011 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held either directly or through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and post retirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 543 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 410 of the assets are valued using other inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 319 for 2012 325 for 2011 and 350 for 2010 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 750 in 2012 gradually declining to 500 in 2019 and thereafter 

  

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 

 we will use a discount rate and eroa of 417 and 775 respectively for estimating our 2013 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and eroa of 416 and 741 respectively for estimating our 2013 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2012 and 2011 pension and postretirement costs including such expenses charged to our discontinued operations were 722 million and 873 million respectively the company expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 951 million 734 million 834 million 927 million and 951 million in 2013 2014 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

new accounting standards 

fair value measurements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures that result in common fair value measurements and disclosures between us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” and international financial reporting standards this new guidance amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to increase transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization this guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on january 1 2012 and was required to be applied prospectively the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance in december 2011 the fasb deferred the requirement to present reclassification adjustments of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement this new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income was effective for the company beginning on january 1 2012 as the company already presented the components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement prior to the adoption of the guidance the adoption of the new guidance did not have an impact on its results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

testing goodwill for impairment 

in september 2011 the fasb updated the accounting guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment this update permits an entity to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test that is currently in place under the new guidance an entity will not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed by the company beginning on january 1 2012 the adoption of this update to the guidance did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance that amends existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenuegenerating transaction where multiple deliverables exist and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables this guidance was effective for the company beginning on january 1 2011 and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

business combinations 

in december 2010 the fasb clarified the requirements for reporting of pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures for business combinations the accounting update specified that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only the amendments also expanded the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations finalized after january 1 2011 as this guidance clarifies and provides for additional disclosure requirements only the adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

intangibles—goodwill 

in december 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that modifies step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the update requires that for those reporting units an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist the qualitative factors are consistent with existing authoritative guidance which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount this guidance was effective for the company beginning on january 1 2011 the adoption of this update did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

the following recently issued accounting standards are not yet required to be adopted by the company or included in the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company 

balance sheet offsetting 

in december 2011 the fasb issued accounting guidance to amend the existing disclosure requirements for offsetting financial assets and liabilities to enhance current disclosures as well as to improve comparability of balance sheets prepared under gaap and ifrs in january 2013 the fasb issued additional guidance on the 

  

scope of these disclosures the revised disclosure guidance applies to derivative instruments and securities borrowing and lending transactions that are subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement the revised disclosure guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for interim and annual periods beginning january 1 2013 as this guidance provides for additional disclosure requirements only the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment 

in july 2012 the fasb updated the accounting guidance related to testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment this update permits an entity to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test under current guidance this update is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 early adoption is permitted the company is evaluating the specific provisions of the updated guidance but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 the fasb updated accounting guidance to add new disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income the update does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in financial statements however the amendments require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts the amendments are required to be applied prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning january 1 2013 as this guidance provides for additional disclosure requirements only the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2012 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in a 27 million decrease in our pretax earnings 

in july 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 1000 million this agreement effectively converted the interest on 1000 million of outstanding 6085 fixed rate debt maturing 2017 to a variable rate of sixmonth libor plus 3422 we entered into this interest rate swap to mitigate interest cost at the parent company relating to debt that was incurred by our prior owners and was not used in any 

  

manner to finance the cash needs of our subsidiaries for both the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 the interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 24 million as the swap interest rates are fixed through april 2013 a hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rates associated with the interest swap agreement would result in a 07 million decrease on our pretax earnings for the year ended december 31 2012 this calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates 

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the ability to recover price increases through rates nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations many of which are unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated activities for both our regulated businesses and marketbased operations our regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and other customers while our marketbased operations engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates in addition pension and other benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields 

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

our history as a public company 

the company was founded in 1886 as the american water works  guarantee company for the purposes of building and purchasing water systems in mckeesport pennsylvania in 1935 the company was reorganized under its current name and in 1947 the common stock of the company became publicly traded on the new york stock exchange “nyse” in 2003 we were acquired by rwe aktiengesellschaft which we refer to as rwe a stock corporation incorporated in the federal republic of germany on april 28 2008 rwe aqua holdings gmbh a german limited liability company and a direct whollyowned subsidiary of rwe which then was the sole owner of the company’s common stock completed a partial divestiture of its investment through an initial public offering “ipo” subsequently rwe continued to divest of its investment in our common stock through public offerings and on november 24 2009 rwe completed the divestiture as a result of the ipo we again became listed on the nyse under the symbol “awk” and resumed our position as the largest publicly traded water utility company in the united states 

during 2011 we either sold or announced the sale of assets or stock of certain of our regulated and market based subsidiaries as outlined in “our regulated businesses” and “our marketbased operation” discussions below as such these subsidiaries have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented and are not included in the discussions below unless otherwise noted see note 3 to consolidated financial statements for further details on our discontinued operations 

regulated businesses overview 

our primary business involves the ownership of subsidiaries that provide water and wastewater utility services to residential commercial industrial and other customers including sale for resale and public authority customers our subsidiaries that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by certain 

  

state commissions or other entities engaged in economic regulation hereafter referred to as “pucs” in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters we report the results of our primary business in the regulated businesses segment 

as noted above for 2011 operating revenue for our regulated businesses segment was 23689 million accounting for 888 of total consolidated operating revenue for the same period regulated businesses segment operating revenues were 22857 million for 2010 and 20766 million for 2009 accounting for 895 and 907 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

the following charts set forth operating revenue for 2011 and customers as of december 31 2011 for the states in which our regulated businesses provide services 

 

 marketbased operations overview 

we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs through our marketbased operations our marketbased operations include three lines of business 

 

  

  

   

for 2011 operating revenue for our marketbased operations was 3278 million accounting for 123 of total operating revenue for the same period the marketbased operations’ operating revenue was 2947 million for 2010 and 2382 million for 2009 accounting for 115 and 104 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

our industry 

overview 

the united states water and wastewater industry has two main sectors i utility ownership which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers and ii general services which involves providing water and wastewater related services to water and wastewater utilities and other customers on a contract basis 

the utility sector includes investorowned as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions the environmental protection agency “epa” estimates that governmentowned systems make up the vast majority of the united states water and wastewater utility segment accounting for approximately 84 of all united states community water systems and approximately 98 of all united states community wastewater systems investorowned water and wastewater systems account for the remainder of the united states water and wastewater community water systems growth of service providers in the investorowned regulated utility sector is achieved through organic growth within a franchise area the provision of bulk water service to other community water systems andor acquisitions including small water and wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers that are in close geographic proximity to already established regulated operations which we herein refer to as “tuckins” 

the utility sector is characterized by high barriers to entry given the capital intensive nature of the industry the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in constant need of modernization and facilities replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of water and wastewater residuals’ discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization the epa estimated that approximately 335 billion of capital spending would be necessary between 2007 and 2026 to replace aging infrastructure and to comply with standards to ensure quality water systems across the united states also in 2007 the epa estimated that approximately 390 billion of capital spending would be necessary over the next 20 years to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states in addition the 2011 american society of civil engineers’ report failure to act the economic impact of current investment trends in water and wastewater treatment infrastructure estimates that as investment needs continue to escalate and current funding trends continue to fall short of the needs it will likely result in unreliable water service and wastewater treatment according to the report this can result in water disruptions impediments to emergency response and damage to other types of infrastructure as well as water shortages from failing infrastructure and drought that may result in unsanitary conditions and increase the likelihood of public health issues 

  

the following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2007 through 2026 for united states water systems 

 

over the next several years we estimate that companyfunded capital investment for our operations will range between 800 million and 1 billion per year our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace existing infrastructure as needed and construction of facilities to meet environmental requirements and new customer growth the charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures by asset type and purpose of investment respectively 

 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generally require regulatory approval processes in order to do business which may involve obtaining relevant operating approvals including certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations from state pucs investorowned water and wastewater systems are generally subject to economic regulation by the state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters for both investorowned and governmentowned water and wastewater utilities 

  

the general services sector includes engineering and consulting companies and numerous other feeforservice businesses these include building and operating water and wastewater utility systems system repair services lab services sale of water infrastructure and distribution products such as pipes and other specialized services the general services segment is characterized by aggressive competition and marketdriven growth and profit margins 

according to the epa the utility segment of the united states water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented with approximately 52000 community water systems and approximately 16000 community wastewater facilities fiftysix percent of the approximately 52000 community water systems are very small serving a population of 500 or less 

this large number of relatively small fragmented water systems as well as fragmented wastewater facilities may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread overhead expenses over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time 

water and wastewater rates 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generate operating revenue from customers based on rates that are generally established by state pucs through a ratesetting process that may include public hearings evidentiary hearings and the submission by the utility of evidence and testimony in support of the requested level of rates in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on six areas i the amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered “used and useful” in providing public service ii the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service typically by making reference to a representative 12month period of time known as a test year iii the appropriate rate of return iv revenue at existing rates v the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements across the customer base and vi the quality of service the utility provides including issues raised by customers 

  

water and wastewater rates in the united states are among the lowest rates in developed countries and for most us consumers water and wastewater bills make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services the following chart sets forth the relative cost of water and other public services including trash and garbage collection and sewer maintenance in the united states as a percentage of total household utility expenditures 

 

our regulated businesses 

our core regulated businesses which consist of locally managed utility subsidiaries that generally are economically regulated by the states in which they operate accounted for 23689 million or 888 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2011 our regulated businesses provide a high degree of financial stability because i high barriers to entry provide certain protections from competitive pressures ii economic regulation promotes predictability in financial planning and longterm performance through the ratesetting process and iii our customer base 

as a result of our portfolio optimization initiative we announced certain acquisitions to and dispositions from our regulated businesses in may 2011 we completed the acquisition of 11 regulated water systems and 48 wastewater systems in missouri for a purchase price of 33 million additionally in june 2011 we completed the sale of the assets of our texas regulated subsidiary for proceeds of 62 million the missouri acquisition added approximately 1700 water customers and nearly 2000 wastewater customers the texas assets served approximately 4200 water and 1100 wastewater customers in the greater houston metropolitan area 

in january 2011 we announced that we had entered into an agreement with epcor water usa inc “epcor usa” to sell all the stock of our regulated water and wastewater operating companies located in arizona and new mexico the sale of these operating companies was completed on january 31 2012 

on july 8 2011 we entered into an agreement to purchase seven regulated water systems in new york for approximately 71 million adding approximately 50000 customers to our new york regulated operations in a separate agreement we will sell eight regulated water systems and one wastewater system in ohio for approximately 89 million plus assumed liabilities of approximately 31 million for an estimated enterprise value of approximately 120 million ohio american water currently serves approximately 58000 customers the completion of both transactions is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval by the pucs in both new york and ohio in february 2012 the ohio puc approved the sale of our ohio subsidiary however both approvals are required to close the transactions the closing on these transactions is expected to occur in the first half of 2012 

as noted above as a result of these sales or pending sales these regulated subsidiaries are presented as discontinued operations therefore the amounts statistics and tables presented in this section refer only to ongoing operations unless otherwise noted 

  

the following table sets forth operating revenue for 2011 and number of customers from continuing operations as well as an estimate of population served as of december 31 2011 in the states where our regulated businesses operate 

 

  

   approximately 884 of operating revenue from our regulated businesses in 2011 was generated from approximately 27 million customers in our seven largest states as measured by operating revenues in fiscal year 2011 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our annual operating revenue 

overview of networks facilities and water supply 

our regulated businesses operate in approximately 1100 communities in 16 states in the united states our primary operating assets include approximately 80 surface water treatment plants 500 groundwater treatment plants 1000 groundwater wells 100 wastewater treatment facilities 1100 treated water storage facilities 1200 pumping stations and 90 dams and 46000 miles of mains and collection pipes we own substantially all of the assets used by our regulated businesses we generally own the land and physical assets used to store extract and treat source water typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our regulated businesses we have ongoing infrastructure renewal programs in all states in which our regulated businesses operate these programs consist of both rehabilitation of existing mains and replacement of mains that have reached the end of their useful service lives 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water we employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of the economic effect of weather extremes for the company as a whole in any given summer some areas are likely to experience drier than average weather while other areas will experience wetter than average weather 

  

our regulated businesses are dependent upon a defined source of water supply our regulated businesses obtain their water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams in addition we also obtain water from ground water sources such as wells and purchase water from other water suppliers 

the following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our regulated businesses for 2011 by volume 

 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we use comprehensive planning processes and maintain contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ sophisticated models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may be predicted and mitigated as needed through demand management and additional supply development 

the percentage of finished water supply by source type for our top seven states by regulated businesses revenues for 2011 is as follows 

 

  

    

the level of treatment we apply to the water varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources such as rivers typically require significant treatment while some groundwater sources such as aquifers require chemical treatment only in addition a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water purveyors treated water is transported through an extensive transmission and distribution network which includes underground pipes above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water to the customers’ premises 

we also have installed production meters to measure the water that we deliver to our distribution network we employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption ranging from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices touch read or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards the treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent and the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of in accordance with applicable standards and regulations 

customers 

we have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our regulated businesses for the purposes of our regulated businesses an active customer is defined as a connection to our water andor wastewater networks a customer with both water and wastewater would count as two customers also as in the case of apartment complexes businesses and many homes multiple individuals may be served by a single connection 

residential customers make up the majority of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate in 2011 residential customers accounted for 911 of the customers and 590 of the operating revenue of our regulated businesses we also serve commercial customers such as shops and businesses industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we also supply water to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities as well as providing bulk water supplies to other water utilities for distribution to their own customers 

the following table sets forth the number of water and wastewater customers by customer class for our regulated businesses as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

   

the following table sets forth water services operating revenue by customer class and wastewater services operating revenue excluding other revenues for our regulated businesses for 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 substantially all of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption typically on a monthly basis our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption 

customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions particularly during the summer our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenue and operating income summer weather that is hotter and drier than average generally increases operating revenues and operating income however when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies thereby reducing customer demand and operating revenue these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands other factors affecting our customers’ usage of water include conservation initiatives including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers declining household sizes in the united states and deterioration in the economy and credit markets which could have an adverse impact on our industrial and commercial customers’ operational and financial performance 

customer growth in our regulated businesses is driven by i organic population growth in our authorized service areas ii adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water andor wastewater utility systems and iii the sale of water to other community water systems generally we add customers through tuckins of small water andor wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers in close geographic proximity to areas where we currently operate our regulated businesses we will continue to acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuckins the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies historically pursuing tuckins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate certain markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses we will also selectively seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing and new markets before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for quality reliability and compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality standards 

  

supplies 

our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals energy and fuel as well as maintenance material and other critical inputs many of these inputs are subject to shortterm price volatility shortterm price volatility is partially mitigated through existing procurement contracts current supplier continuity plans and the regulatory rate setting process 

because of our geographic diversity we maintain relationships with many chemical equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace and we do not rely on any single entity for a material amount of our supplies we also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and longterm cost effectiveness as a result of this process and our strong relationships with suppliers we are able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations 

we typically have a combination of standby power generation or dual electric service feeds at key facilities multiple water production facilities emergency interconnections with adjacent water systems and finished water storage that keep our operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies 

regulation 

economic regulation 

our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective pucs the term “economic regulation” is intended to indicate that these state pucs regulate the economic aspects of service to the public but do not generally establish water quality standards which are typically set by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” andor state environmental authorities state pucs have broad authority to regulate many of the economic and service aspects of the utilities for example state pucs often issue certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations that may be required for a company to provide service in specific areas they also approve the rates and conditions under which service is provided and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate specific authority might differ from state to state but in most states pucs approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions and relationships between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations mergers and acquisitions in many instances approvals are required prior to the transaction regulatory policies not only vary from state to state but can change over time as well these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the pucs in the states in which we operate and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate case delays or inadequate rate recovery 

economic regulation of utilities involves many competing and occasionally conflicting public interests and policy goals the primary responsibility of pucs is to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and the utility although the specific approach to economic regulation varies certain general principles are consistent across the states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate for example based on certain legal and regulatory principles utilities are entitled to recover through rates charged to customers prudent and reasonable operating costs as well as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on and recovery of prudent used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers pucs will also generally accord a utility the right to serve specific areas and will also provide investorowned utilities with limited protection from competition because the requirement of an investorowned utility to operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations typically prevents other investorowned utilities from competing with it in the authorized area in return the utility undertakes the obligation to provide reliable service without unreasonable discrimination to all customers within the authorized area 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to a volumetric charge based on consumption and a base fee component set by a tariff approved by the puc the process to obtain approval for a change in 

  

rates generally involves filing a petition or “rate case” by the utility with the puc on a periodic basis as determined by the need to recover capital expenditures reduced revenue increased operating costs or the utility determines that its current authorized return is not sufficient given current market conditions to provide a reasonable return on investment a puc may also initiate a rate proceeding or investigation if it believes a utility may be earning in excess of its authorized rate of return or other issues exist which justify a review pucs may also impose other conditions on the content and timing of filings designed to affect rates rate cases often involve a lengthy administrative process which can be costly the utility the state puc staff consumer advocates and other customers who may participate in the process generally submit testimony and supporting financial data from a twelve month period of time known as the “test year” state statutes and puc rules and precedent usually determine whether the test year should be based on a historical period a historical period adjusted for certain “known and measurable” changes or forecasted data the majority of our states require the test year to be based on a historical period adjusted for certain known and measurable changes the evidence is presented in public hearings held in connection with the rate case which are economic and service quality factfinding in nature and are typically conducted in a triallike setting before the puc or an administrative law judge during the process the utility is required to provide puc staff and intervenors with all relevant information they may request concerning the utility’s operations costs and investments the decision of the puc should be based on the evidence presented at the hearing 

some state pucs are more restrictive than others with regard to the types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their ratemaking processes and how they reach their final rate determinations however in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on a number of areas including the amount and prudence of investment in facilities operating and maintenance expenses and taxes the appropriate cost of capital and equity return revenues at current and expected levels allocation of the revenue requirements among customer classes service quality and issues raised by customers 

failure of the pucs to recognize reasonable and prudent operating and capital costs can result in the inability of the utility to earn the allowed return and can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete therefore there is frequently a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating cost increase and when those costs are reflected in rates for instance an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not begin to be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until the effective date of the subsequent rate case our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files rate cases with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on and of invested capital that are permitted by the puc 

our regulated subsidiaries work with legislatures and pucs to mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag through the adoption of positive regulatory policies these policies include for example infrastructure replacement surcharges that allow rates to change rates outside the context of a general rate proceeding to reflect on a more timely basis investments to replace aging infrastructure necessary to sustain high quality reliable service currently pennsylvania illinois missouri indiana new york and california allow the use of infrastructure surcharges in november 2011 the new jersey board of public utilities “bpu” voted unanimously to publish draft rules that if adopted would implement a distribution system improvement charge for specified water infrastructure investments the draft rules were published for public comment in december 2011 allowing time for resolution of public comments and final approval april 2012 is the earliest estimate for the rule to become final 

forwardlooking test year mechanisms allow us to earn on a more current basis our current or projected usage and costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital some states have permitted use 

  

of a fully forecasted test year instead of historical data to set rates examples of these states include illinois kentucky new york tennessee and california in all states in which we operate on a regulated basis pucs have allowed utilities to update historical data for certain “known and measurable” changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year this allows utilities to take account of more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process the extent to which historical data can be updated will generally vary from state to state 

surcharge mechanisms are also available in a number of states to reflect outside of general rate proceeding changes in major operating expenses which may be beyond the utility’s control for example new jersey california virginia and illinois have allowed surcharges for purchased water costs california has allowed surcharges for power and certain other costs and new york has allowed annual reconciliations for revenues and expenses such as power fuel chemicals and property taxes 

certain states have approved consolidated rates or singletariff pricing policies consolidated rates or singletariff pricing is the use of a unified rate structure for multiple water systems that are owned and operated by a single utility but may or may not be contiguous or physically interconnected the singletariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state based on costs that are determined on a statewide or intrastate regional basis thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for us and our customers for states that do not employ singetariffs we may have multiple general rate cases filed at any given point in time states that have adopted a full or partial singletariff pricing policy included pennsylvania new jersey west virginia kentucky ohio indiana illinois and iowa therefore of our seven largest states five have some form of singletariff pricing 

another mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag is the potential ability in certain circumstances to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is in service instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include pennsylvania ohio kentucky virginia illinois and california in addition some states such as indiana allow the utility to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the puc assesses the prudency of such projects 

in some states the puc has implemented mechanisms to enhance utility revenue stability in light of conservation initiatives decreasing per capita consumption or other factors sometimes referred to as “decoupling” these mechanisms to some extent separate recoverable revenues from volumes of water sold for example the state of california has decoupled revenues from water sold to help achieve the state initiative to reduce water usage by 20 by 2020 this progressive regulation enables utilities to encourage conservation as revenues are not tied to sales also as a result of this mechanism utilities are less susceptible to consumption changes as a result of conservation declining per capita usage or other factors affecting consumption likewise new york has implemented a surcharge or credit based on the difference between actual net revenues for the preceding year and the net revenue target as estimated in the most recent rate case 

the company pursues these positive regulatory policies as part of our rate and revenue management program to enhance our ability to provide high quality sustainable cost effective service to customers to facilitate efficient recovery of our costs and investments and to ensure positive shortterm liquidity and longterm profitability the ability of the company to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case and these policies will reduce but not eliminate regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes however the company strives to use these and other regulatory policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection 

  

of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater we are also subject to certain regulations regarding fire protection services in the areas we serve these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we also are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently the overall trend has been that they have become more stringent over time as newer or stricter standards are introduced our capital and operating costs could increase we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our regulated businesses are subject in the past we have generally been able to recover costs associated with compliance related to environmental health and safety standards but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy including responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural resources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples from across our water systems are analyzed on a regular basis for material compliance with regulatory requirements across the company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2011 we achieved a score of greater than 99 for drinking water compliance and according to the epa statistics american water’s performance has been far better than the industry average over the last several years in fact in 2011 american water was 28 times better than the industry average for compliance with drinking water quality standards maximum contaminant levels and 118 times better for compliance with drinking water monitoring and reporting requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water the united states epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 67 of our 86 surface water plants receiving the program’s “director” award we account for approximately onethird of the plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 62 american water plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award while 40 have been awarded the “tenyear phase iii” award 

safe drinking water act 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns 

to effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 

  

the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources in 2006 the epa also proposed revisions to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule in 2012 we anticipate that the epa will finalize revisions to the total coliform rule that were part of the mandate of a federal advisory committee appointed to negotiate the changes most of the anticipated changes to the rule will not be effective until 2013 or later the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds but we do not anticipate that any of these regulations will be completed in 2012 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act pursuant to the npdes program the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems we believe that we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which 

result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals which generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the united states occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see “business—research and development” 

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters these proceedings are described further in the section entitled “item 3—legal proceedings” 

competition 

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct competition in providing services in our existing markets because i we operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a barrier to market entry our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supplytreatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions our largest investorowned competitors when pursuing acquisitions based 

  

on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environnement american states water co and california water services group 

condemnation 

the potential exists that portions of our subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods 

 

  

  

 the acquisition consideration related to such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter we believe our operating subsidiaries would be entitled to fair market value for any assets required to be sold and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets 

we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business the last of which occurred in september 2008 we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses 

our marketbased operations 

in addition to our regulated businesses we operate the following marketbased operations which generated 3278 million of operating revenue in 2011 representing 123 of total operating revenue for the same period of the lines of business outlined below no single group within our marketbased operations generates in excess of 10 of our aggregate revenue 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including om and design build and operate “dbo” contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities the food and beverage industry and other customers we typically make no capital investment under these contracts with municipalities and other customers instead we perform our services for a fee during the contract term we may make limited capital investments under our contracts with the united states military and certain industrial customers our contract operations group generated revenue of 2305 million in 2011 representing 703 of revenue for our marketbased operations 

on december 31 2011 we completed the sale of our applied water management inc group “awm” in two separate transactions for combined proceeds of approximately 30 million awm provided customized water and wastewater management solutions through contract operations with real estate developers industrial clients and smalltomidsized communities its annual revenue and net loss in 2011 were 216 million and 06 million respectively as noted above this subsidiary is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented therefore all amounts and statistics disclosed for the contract operations group refers only to ongoing operations of the contract operations group 

we are currently party to more than 100 contracts varying in size and scope across the united states and canada with contracts ranging in term from two to 50 years included in the these contracts are nine 50year 

  

contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems and one 3year subcontract with a municipality acting as primary contractor with the department of defense for similar services on an interim basis until construction of new connections to an existing municipal facility are completed all of our contracts with the us government may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to the standard terms of the us government contract termination provisions we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group through our service line protection program provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial establishments to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking water pipes and clogged or blocked sewer pipes inside and outside their accommodations 

our linesaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipalities our homeowner services group has approximately 900000 customer contracts in 17 states 

terratec environmental ltd 

our marketbased operations also includes our biosolids management group terratec which is located in canada and provides environmentally sustainable management and disposal of biosolids and wastewater byproducts 

competition 

we face competition in our marketbased operations from a number of service providers including veolia environnement american states omi and southwest water particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competitive as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as the municipal and industrial fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process 

research and development 

we established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our business our research and development personnel are located in new jersey in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports research through sophisticated testing and analysis since its inception our research and development program has evolved to become a leading waterrelated research program achieving advancements in the science of drinking water including sophisticated water testing procedures and desalination technologies 

since the formation of the epa in 1970 we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa has helped us to achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

  

in 2011 we spent 26 million on research and development compared to 28 million spent in 2010 and 2009 approximately onequarter of our research budget is comprised of competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers 

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical in providing quality and reliable service at reasonable rates in maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

support services 

our american water works service company subsidiary provides shared services and corporate governance that achieve economies of scale through central administration these services are provided predominantly to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services which are provided at cost may include accounting administration business development corporate secretarial education and training engineering financial health and safety human resources information systems legal operations procurement rates security risk management water quality and research and development these arrangements afford our operating companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis we also operate two national customer service centers which are located in alton illinois and pensacola florida 

our security department provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing implementing monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs we are in contact with federal state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply 

employee matters 

currently approximately 49 of our workforce is represented by unions we have 83 collective bargaining agreements in place with 19 different unions representing our unionized employees in september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement we implemented our last best and final offer on january 1 2011 in order to maintain health care coverage for our employees in accordance with terms of the offer the unions have challenged our right to implement our last best and final offer in this regard following the filing by the utility workers union of america of an unfair labor practice charge the national labor relations board “nlrb” issued a complaint against us in january 2012 claiming that we implemented the last best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the federal mediation and conciliation service a state mediation agency and several state departments of labor we have asserted that we did in fact provide sufficient notice a hearing date on the matter has not been set in addition six local unions filed grievances or demands for arbitration under their respective local collective bargaining agreements regarding our implementation of the last best and final offer in response we filed a declaratory judgment action against the local unions in united states district court for the district of new jersey seeking among other things an injunction preventing the unions from filing grievances or demanding arbitration under the local collective bargaining agreements with respect to the implementation of our last best and final offer three of the unions were removed from the litigation after they agreed to a dismissal with prejudice two of the unions were 

  

removed from the new jersey district court action and the company is pursuing similar declaratory judgment actions against the unions in united states district courts in pennsylvania and west virginia we will continue to defend our position in any challenge presented by the unions management does not expect any work disruption by union members at this time in addition to matters relating to the expired national benefit agreement five local union contracts covering approximately 700 employees expired without a new agreement being reached prior to december 31 2011 one contract relating to employees in st louis missouri was negotiated to impasse and our last best and final offer was implemented on july 11 2011 there have been no work stoppages with respect to these contracts nevertheless management has developed contingency plans that will be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur over onequarter of our local union contracts will expire during 2012

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or cash flows and liquidity 

risks related to our industry and business 

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation decisions by state pucs and other regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are economically regulated by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses to enable us to finance the addition of new or the replacement of existing water and wastewater infrastructure and to provide us the opportunity to earn what they determine to be an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

  

our ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends upon the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be approved or that any approval will be given in a timely manner moreover a puc may not approve a rate request to an extent that is sufficient to cover our expenses including purchased water and costs of chemicals fuel and other commodities used in our operations enable us to recover our investment and provide us an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital to the extent permitted by state pucs this could occur if water usage is less than anticipated in establishing rates as billings to customers are to a considerable extent based on usage in addition to a base rate or if our investments or expenses prove to be higher than was estimated in establishing rates 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations compliance with increasingly stringent laws and regulations could impact our operating costs and violations of such laws and regulations could subject the company to substantial liabilities and costs 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include the united states clean water act of 1972 which we refer to as the clean water act and the united states safe drinking water act of 1974 which we refer to as the safe drinking water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations in addition state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs as well as damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or to a municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental water quality and health and safety laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental water quality and health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement generally have become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases to recover such costs or that such costs will not materially and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities if under environmental laws and regulations we are required to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused an adverse environmental impact the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by insurance and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

  

the current regulatory rate setting structure may result in a significant delay or “regulatory lag” from the time that we invest in infrastructure improvements incur increased operating expenses or experience declining water usage to the time at which we can address these events through the rate case application process our inability to minimize regulatory lag could adversely affect our business 

there is typically a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and the time when those costs are reflected in rates in addition billings permitted by state pucs typically are to a considerable extent based on the volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate thus we may experience a regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining usage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage our inability to reduce this regulatory lag could have an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

several state pucs are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of the rate case application process through surcharges that address capital investments to replace aging infrastructure and increases in costs beyond the utility’s control such as purchased water costs property taxes and other expenditures these surcharge mechanisms enable us to adjust rates closer to the time costs have been incurred than would be the case under the rate case application process currently seven states permit us to use infrastructure surcharges related to our capital investments to replace aging infrastructure these surcharges periodically are adjusted based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures and specific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new pucapproved base rates in addition to the infrastructure surcharges three states have permitted us to add surcharges for purchased water costs one state has permitted us to add surcharges for power and conservation costs and one state has permitted us to add surcharges for expenses such as utility and chemical costs while these surcharges have been a positive development some state pucs have not approved surcharges for infrastructure improvement no state puc has enabled us to add a surcharge for all of the operating expenses described above and no state puc has enabled us to address declining water usage through a surcharge although we intend to expand our efforts to obtain state puc approval of surcharges to address infrastructure investments increases in operating expenses and declining water usage our efforts may not be successful in which case our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected 

availability of water supplies restrictions on use natural hazards severe weather conditions competing uses and economic conditions may adversely affect our access to sources of water the demand for water services or our ability to supply water to customers 

our ability to meet the existing and future demand of our customers depends on the availability of an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as a result we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights determined by legislation or court decisions and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passingflow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements which can change from time to time may adversely impact our water supply drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water for example in our monterey county california operations we are seeking to augment our sources of water supply principally to comply with an order of the california state water resources control board that our subsidiary californiaamerican water company “cawc” significantly decrease its diversion from the carmel river in accordance with a reduction schedule running through december 31 2016 we are also required to augment our monterey county sources of water supply to comply with the requirements of the endangered species act we have implemented conservation rates and other programs to address demand and are utilizing aquifer storage and recovery facilities to store winter water 

  

for summer use we were hopeful that we could address the water supply issues in a meaningful way through a regional desalination project the “project” that was to be implemented through a water purchase agreement and ancillary agreements the “agreements” among the marina coast water district “mcwd” the monterey county water resources agency “mcwra” and cawc as part of the project cawc was to construct a conveyance pipeline from the desalination facility we also planned to construct four additional pipelines and two pump stations the “ancillary facilities” however the project was subject to considerable delay and disputes among the parties in july 2011 mcwra advised mcwd and cawc that the agreements were void by letter delivered to mcwd and mcwra on september 28 2011 cawc terminated the agreements based on mcwra’s repudiation of the agreements mcwd has continued to assert that the agreements remain in effect nevertheless the parties agreed to participate in mediation in an attempt to resolve issues relating to the project and the agreements in october 2011 during the pendency of the mediation cawc filed a petition the “petition” with the california public utility commission “cpuc” seeking clarification that it may go forward with constructing the ancillary facilities regardless of the status of the project mcwd and the california division of ratepayer advocates are opposing the petition ultimately the mediation was not successful and ended on january 16 2012 on january 17 2012 cawc announced that it had withdrawn support of the agreements in a prehearing conference with respect to the petition cawc advised the administrative law judge assigned to the matter that it will seek cpuc approval of an alternate proposal the administrative law judge directed cawc to file jointly with the mcwd and mcwra if possible a status report addressing various issues relating to the project and to submit a compliance filing to address cawc’s plans to move forward on a new project the filings are due by march 1 2012 we cannot predict the ultimate effect of the events described above on cawc’s efforts to secure alternative sources of water if cawc is unable to secure an alternative source of water our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 

government restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas if a regional drought were to occur governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system there were voluntary conservation efforts or water use restrictions implemented during certain periods of 2011 in pennsylvania and new jersey following drought conditions water demand may not return to predrought levels even after restrictions are lifted decreased use of water services resulting from any of these events may adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas these include winter storms and freezing conditions high wind conditions tornados earthquakes high water conditions in or near designated flood plains hurricanes and severe electrical storms these weather events may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage in the third quarter of 2011 our new jersey and pennsylvania subsidiaries experienced service interruptions in certain of our operating areas and in some cases a loss in customers as a result of the extreme weather including hurricane irene and other severe storms in the northeast in addition the devastating tornado that struck joplin missouri on may 22 2011 caused extensive damage to our infrastructure and the water distribution system among other things we lost our service center and plant storage buildings and suffered damage to the roof and windows at our water treatment plant as well as to many of our vehicles in addition while our water treatment plant remained operational the lack of electricity forced us to operate on generator power until electric power was restored within the next two days we also had to address more than 4000 leaking customer service lines and 25 torn fire service lines because it was not possible to maintain system pressure initially the missouri department of natural resources issued a boil water order the order was lifted after we restored full pressure to the system flushed the entire system and completed sampling tests all within six days after the order was issued any interruption in our ability to supply water or to collect treat and properly dispose of wastewater or any costs associated with restoring service could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

  

furthermore losses from business interruptions or damage to our facilities might not be covered by our insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

adverse economic conditions can cause our customers particularly industrial customers to curtail operations a curtailment of operations by an industrial customer would typically result in reduced water usage in more severe circumstances the decline in usage could be permanent any decrease in demand resulting from difficult economic conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection or treatment systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages which may not be recoverable in rates this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition moreover if we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow our losses might not be covered by insurance and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

our inability to efficiently implement our business transformation project could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and profitability 

we have undertaken a “business transformation” project which is intended to improve our business processes and upgrade our antiquated core information technology systems this multiyear enterprisewide initiative is intended to support our broader strategic initiatives the project is intended to optimize workflow throughout our field operations improve our backoffice operations and enhance our customer service capabilities the scale and anticipated future costs associated with the business transformation project are significant and we could incur costs significantly in excess of budgeted costs any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may increase the costs of the project and have an adverse effect on our operations and reporting processes including our internal control over financial reporting when we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure further we may not realize anticipated cost improvements and greater efficiencies from the project we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely or adequate rate recovery of any increased costs associated with the business transformation project as of december 31 2011 expenditures on the project totaled  1397 million we anticipate that total expenditures of as much as  280 million will be required to complete the project 

currently we operate numerous information technology systems that have varying degrees of integration sometimes leading to inefficiencies therefore delays in completion of the business transformation project will also delay cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the project we may also experience difficulties consolidating our current systems moving to a common set of operational processes and implementing a successful change management process these difficulties may impact our ability to meet customer needs efficiently any such delays or difficulties may have a material and adverse impact on our business client relationships and financial results 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we experience delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is very capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2011 we invested 9249 million in net 

  

companyfunded capital improvements the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems could increase in the future we fund capital improvement projects using cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and issuances of longterm debt and equity securities we can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all 

in addition we believe that our dividend policy could limit our ability to pursue growth in particular the use of cash to pay dividends could affect our ability to make large acquisitions or pursue other growth opportunities that require cash investments in amounts greater than our available cash and external financing resources in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions including tuckin acquisitions principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we expect that we will need additional financing however we intend to retain sufficient cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 

if we do not obtain sufficient capital we may be unable to maintain our existing property plant and equipment realize our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and successfully expand the rate base upon which we are able to earn future returns on our investment and a return of our investment even if we have adequate resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital expenditures on time as a result of construction delays or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

weather conditions could adversely affect demand for our water service and our revenues 

demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other outside water use throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months demand tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal or if there is more rainfall than normal the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

our inability to access the capital or financial markets could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to cash from operations we rely on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs in this regard our principal external source of liquidity is our revolving credit facility we regularly use our commercial paper program as a principal source of shortterm borrowing due to the generally more attractive rates we obtain in the commercial paper market however disruptions in the capital markets could limit our ability to access capital for example in september 2008 we were unable to access shortterm liquidity through our commercial paper program and were compelled to borrow under our credit facilities with a syndicate of banks this resulted in an increase in our borrowing costs until the time we again were able to access the commercial paper market although our difficulties in accessing capital were resolved as the severity of the recent financial crisis subsided we cannot assume that similar adverse events in the financial markets will not occur again in the future moreover while our credit facility lending banks have met all of their obligations disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs particularly if borrowings through the commercial paper market are unavailable we maintain an 840 million revolving credit facility commitments of 685 million under this revolving credit facility mature on september 15 2013 and the remaining 155 million of commitments expire on september 15 2012 our inability to renew or replace these commitments could materially increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities and 320 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 21 2012 awcc had 947 million of outstanding commercial paper as of february 21 2012 we cannot assure that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any significant disruption in the capital and credit markets or financial institution failures could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures 

any impediments to our access to the capital markets failure of our lenders to meet their commitments increased interest expense or cash conservation measures resulting from financial market disruptions or otherwise could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities as well as assumptions related to the benefit plans which may require us to provide significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy significant future obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans these assets are subject to market fluctuations which may cause investment returns to fall below our projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under our pension and postretirement benefit plans if future returns on these assets are insufficient to offset the decline in value additionally the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease thereby reducing returns our liabilities increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of our obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates and our results of operations and financial position could be negatively affected 

in addition market factors can affect assumptions we use in determining funding requirements with respect to our pension and postretirement plans for example a relatively modest change in our assumptions regarding discount rates can materially affect our calculation of funding requirements to the extent that market data compels us to reduce the discount rate used in our assumptions our benefit obligations could be materially increased which could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2011 our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 59050 million and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

 in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our credit facilities or issue new debt securities in the capital markets moreover additional borrowings may be required to refinance outstanding indebtedness debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2012 and 2013 are 289 million and 1126 million respectively  we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms if at all if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt therefore our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity in addition if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business which could cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

currently approximately 49 of our workforce is represented by unions we have 83 collective bargaining agreements in place with 19 different unions representing our unionized employees we might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are favorable to us any negotiations or dispute resolution processes undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or affected by labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity in september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement we implemented our “last best and final” offer on january 1 2011 in order to provide health care coverage for our employees in accordance with the terms of the offer the unions have challenged our right to implement our last best and final offer in this regard following the filing by the utility workers union of america of an unfair labor practice charge the national labor relations board “nlrb” issued a complaint against us in january 2012 claiming that we implemented the last best and final offer without providing sufficient notice of the existence of a dispute with the federal mediation and conciliation service a state mediation agency and several state departments of labor we have asserted that we did in fact provide sufficient notice a hearing date on the matter has not been set in addition six local unions filed grievances or demands for arbitration under their respective local collective bargaining agreements regarding our implementation of the last best and final offer in response we filed a declaratory judgment action against the local unions in united states district court for the district of new jersey seeking among other things an injunction preventing the unions from filing grievances or demanding arbitration under the local collective bargaining agreements with respect to the implementation of our last best and final offer three of the unions were removed from the litigation after they agreed to a dismissal with prejudice two of the unions were removed from the new jersey district court action and the company is pursuing similar declaratory judgment actions against the unions in united states district courts in pennsylvania and west virginia we will continue to defend our position in any challenge presented by the unions in addition to 

  

the expired national benefit agreement five local union contracts covering approximately 700 employees expired without a new agreement being reached prior to december 31 2011 one contract relating to employees in st louis missouri was negotiated to impasse and our last best and final offer was implemented on july 11 2011 in addition over onequarter of our local union contracts will expire during 2012 although no work stoppages have occurred with respect to the expired contracts described above we cannot provide assurance that a work stoppage or strike will not occur while we have developed contingency plans to be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur we cannot assure that a strike or work stoppage would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

 

contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries to civil or criminal enforcement actions private litigation and cleanup obligations 

our water supplies are subject to contamination including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and possible terrorist attacks if one of our water supplies is contaminated we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply and locate an adequate supply of water from another water source including in some cases through the purchase of water from a thirdparty supplier if we are unable to access a substitute water supply in a costeffective manner our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods we might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates or recovery of these costs may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort or other lawsuits criminal enforcement actions contractual obligations or other consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we own approximately 100 dams a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs can be and has been material we might not be able to recover such costs through rates the inability to recover these higher costs or delayed recovery of the costs as a result of regulatory lag can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams in monterey county california cawc filed an application with the cpuc in september 2010 to seek approval for a project to reroute the carmel river and remove the san clemente dam which is owned by cawc as part of the application cawc is seeking recovery of certain historical costs totaling approximately 269 million related to studies to determine whether the dam could withstand significant flooding and severe earthquakes meeting defined criteria efforts to develop a project to address seismic issues the identification and analysis of possible alternative project options and activities undertaken pursuant to the directives of federal and state government agencies including the california department of water resources division of safety of dams “dsod” which is acting as the lead agency under the state and federal environmental review laws on november 10 2011 a proposed decision “pd” was issued by the administrative law judge assigned to the matter in the pd the administrative law judge recommended that recovery of virtually all of the historical costs should be denied 

  

cawc has filed comments with the cpuc contending that the pd is unreasonable unsupported by and contrary to the evidence and contrary to law and policy the pd is currently under review by the cpuc which has delayed issuing a decision on several occasions and most recently has indicated that it will not vote on a decision until april 19 2012 while we believe there are sound reasons for the cpuc to modify the pd to permit recovery of the historical costs in the event recovery is not permitted our results of operations would be materially adversely affected for the period in which we incur a charge with respect to the write off of the historical costs most of which currently are recorded as regulatory assets and our cash flows in future years would be adversely affected 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in reservoirs located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by government regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future moreover to the extent such business interruptions or other losses are not covered by insurance they may not be recovered through rate adjustments 

risks associated with our portfolio optimization efforts may adversely affect us 

under our portfolio optimization initiative we will continue to seek to acquire or invest in additional water andor wastewater systems while disposing of other systems these transactions are designed to enable us to achieve a more rationalized portfolio cost structure improvements and an enhanced financial profile we will consider acquiring systems in markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses and through tuckins we also will continue to seek to enter into related marketbased businesses and services that complement our businesses acquisition transactions may result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 with respect to dispositions we may be unable to sell on acceptable terms systems that we no longer believe are suitable for our portfolio 

we may also experience difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals for acquisitions or dispositions and any regulatory approvals we obtain may require us to agree to costly and restrictive conditions imposed by regulators we may not identify all significant risks when reviewing a potential transaction and we could be exposed to potential liabilities for which we will not be indemnified or in the case of dispositions we may be required to continue to assume liabilities with respect to systems that we sell we also may encounter difficulties in integrating new businesses including bringing newly acquired businesses up to the necessary level of regulatory compliance retaining and integrating key personnel achieving strategic objectives and integrating 

  

acquired assets and technological systems the demands of identifying and transitioning newly acquired businesses or pursuing investment opportunities may also divert management’s attention from other business concerns and otherwise disrupt our business any of these risks may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

new legislation regulations government policies or court decisions can materially affect our operations the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations changes in agency policy including those made in response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways that could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations 

our total assets include substantial goodwill at december 31 2011 our goodwill totaled 11951 million the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of our previous owner in 2003 and the acquisition of e’town corporation by a predecessor to our previous owner in 2001 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and 

  

intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable as required by the applicable accounting rules we have taken significant noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past in the first quarter of 2009 we recorded a noncash charge to our financial results for a goodwill impairment in the amount of 4500 million which reduced net income by 4430 million in the aggregate goodwill impairment charges including those recognized in our discontinued operations taken in each year from 2006 through 2009 totaled approximately  193 billion and reduced net income by approximately  191 billion 

we may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to our performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of our stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in our market price consistent with our peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized efforts may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through exercise of the governmental power of eminent domain should a municipality or other government subdivision seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain we may resist the acquisition contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated business’s management from the operation of its business moreover out efforts to resist the acquisition may not be successful 

if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges 

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2011 we had us federal and state net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 11874 million and 7398 million respectively our federal nol carryforwards begin to expire in 2024 and our state nol carryforwards will expire between 2012 and 2031 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income moreover because our previous owner’s divestiture of its stock was considered an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code the amount of nol carryforwards that may be utilized in any year is limited our management believes the federal nol carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and therefore currently require no valuation allowance at december 31 2011 1961 million of the state nol carryforwards have been offset by a valuation allowance because the company does not believe these nols will more likely than not be realized in the future and we have in the past been unable to utilize certain of our nols the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance in the future would reduce our deferred income tax assets and our net income 

 

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover changes in income tax laws the economy and general business environment could affect the future utilization of the nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

  

our marketbased operations through american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees including financial guarantees or deposits to our publicsector and public clients who may seek to enforce the guarantees if our marketbased operations do not satisfy certain obligations 

under the terms of some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of specified performance obligations of our marketbased operations including financial guarantees or deposits in the event our marketbased operations fail to perform these obligations the entity holding the guarantees may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

at december 31 2011 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 31130 million and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased operations grow the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms 

our marketbased operations’ longterm contracts with the department of defense may be terminated for the convenience of the us government and are subject to periodic contract price redetermination 

all of our contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in addition the contract price for each of these military contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions any early contract termination or unfavorable price redetermination could adversely affect our results of operations 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to maintain those systems which may negatively affect us as the operators of the systems 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner to undertake capital improvements in some cases we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner 

our marketbased operations are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received 

some of our marketbased operations enter into longterm contracts pursuant to which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee our marketbased operations are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities including production costs such as purchased water electricity fuel and chemicals used in water treatment may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party in addition directly or through our marketbased subsidiaries we often guarantee our marketbased operations’ obligations under those contracts losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

  

we rely on our information technology “it” systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our results of operations we depend on our it systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections our it systems also enable us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers a number of our current it systems are antiquated and it is increasingly difficult to obtain upgrades to and support for these systems while we intend to replace these systems through the business transformation process described above for the time being we remain subject to risks that are underscored by the age of our it systems specifically our it systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these events may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and other adverse consequences in addition the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact of any of these events on us 

in addition we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency 

we may be required to adopt international financial reporting standards “ifrs” or changes in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” that among other things could limit our ability to defer recognition of costs deemed material or otherwise could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

currently our accounting and financial reporting is based on gaap in 2008 the sec proposed a series of milestones sometimes referred to as the “proposed roadmap” that would guide the sec in determining whether to transition from gaap to ifrs among matters considered by the sec was a staged transition into ifrs reporting for public companies beginning for fiscal years ending on or after december 15 2014 for the largest public companies however persons commenting on the proposed roadmap expressed differing views about the proposed approach in response the sec issued a statement in february 2010 that while expressing the sec’s continued support for a single set of highquality global accounting standards directed the sec staff to execute a work plan to aid the sec in evaluating the impact that the use of ifrs by us companies would have on the securities market the sec staff has not yet issued a final report on the work plan recent statements by the sec staff have indicated that the final report on the work plan may be expected in 2012 it is unclear whether the sec will decide whether and if so when ifrs would be incorporated into financial reporting by us public companies 

another initiative that has affected financial reporting by us public companies is efforts by the us financial accounting standards board or the “fasb” and the international accounting standards board or the 

  

“iasb” to develop compatible accounting standards for use in both domestic and crossborder financial reporting the fasb and iasb have worked on a number of projects to achieve accounting convergence with respect to specific accounting topics which have resulted in the adoption of some new standards and continuing efforts on other topics 

under gaap we are subject to the accounting procedures to address the effects of certain types of regulation which among other things allow us to defer recognition of certain costs and record them on the balance sheet as regulatory assets if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs through future rate increases currently ifrs does not contain provisions equivalent to the current gaap accounting procedures the adoption of the ifrs standards or the adoption of other new accounting or financial reporting standards either through the convergence efforts of the fasb and iasb or otherwise could affect our reported performance which in turn could unfavorably impact our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore the transition to and application of new accounting or financial reporting standards could result in increased administrative costs

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend alternative water supply in lieu of carmel river diversions 

in 1995 the california state water resources control board issued an administrative order the “1995 order” to cawc requiring cawc to implement an alternative water supply in lieu of diversions from the carmel river 

  

the state water resources control board held administrative hearings in the summer of 2008 to address claims that cawc has exceeded its water diversion rights in the carmel river and has not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by the 1995 order the state water resources control board adopted a cease and desist order applicable to cawc on october 20 2009 the “2009 order” the 2009 order finds that cawc has not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river as required by the 1995 order the 2009 order requires among other things that cawc significantly decrease its yearly diversions from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule running from the date the 2009 order was adopted until december 31 2016 at which point all unpermitted diversions must end failure to effect the decrease in diversions mandated by the 2009 order could result in substantial penalties the 2009 order also requires that cawc plan design and implement within 24 months of the date the 2009 order was adopted a project or projects designed to reduce the need for carmel river diversions by at least 500 acre feet per year cawc constructed an aquifer storage and recovery well that satisfied this requirement in advance of the 24 month deadline cawc has appealed the 2009 order to the superior court of california challenging the findings and requirements of the 2009 order we can provide no assurances however that the appeal will be successful or that if unsuccessful cawc will be able to comply with the diversion reduction requirements and other remaining requirements under the 2009 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to us on december 2 2010 the cpuc approved the project involving the construction of a desalination facility on the california central coast north of monterey the project was to be implemented through agreements among the mcwd the mcwra and cawc as part of the project a conveyance pipeline from the desalination facility designed to facilitate cawc’s purchase of water from the facility was to be constructed by cawc the cpuc also approved construction of four additional pipelines and two pump stations the “ancillary facilities” the desalination facility was to be constructed and owned by mcwd and mcwra was to construct the wells that were to supply water to the desalination facility the project was intended among other things to fulfill cawc’s obligations under the 1995 order in addition to other obligations 

the project was subject to delay due to among other things funding delays and investigations and inquiries initiated by public authorities relating to an alleged conflict of interest concerning a former member of the mcwra board of directors the “former director” the former director was paid for consulting work by a contractor to mcwd while serving on the mcwra board of directors the contractor subsequently was retained as project manager for the project on july 7 2011 mcwra advised mcwd and cawc that the agreements were void as a result of the conduct of the former director subsequently on august 12 2011 cawc advised mcwd and mcwra that they have defaulted in performance of certain financing obligations under the water purchase agreement by letter delivered to mcwd and mcwra on september 28 2011 cawc terminated the agreements based on mcwra’s repudiation of the agreements in other communications among the parties each of mcwd and mcwra have stated that it complied with the financing obligations and mcwd further responded that among other things cawc did not comply on a timely basis with an obligation under the water purchase agreement that cawc provide a letter of credit mcwd has also asserted that the agreements remain in effect 

cawc mcwra and mcwd agreed to participate in a mediation process with respect to disputes among the parties relating to the agreements in october 2011 during the pendency of the mediation cawc filed the petition with the cpuc seeking clarification that it may go forward with constructing the ancillary facilities regardless of the status of the project mcwd and the california division of ratepayer advocates are opposing the petition 

ultimately the mediation was not successful and terminated on january 16 2012 on january 17 2012 cawc announced that it has withdrawn support of the agreements in addition cawc has evaluated various alternatives to the project at a prehearing conference with respect to the petition held on january 24 2012 cawc advised the administrative law judge assigned to the matter that it will seek cpuc approval of an alternate project the administrative law judge directed cawc to file jointly with mcwd and mcwra if 

  

possible a status report addressing various issues related to the project and to submit a compliance filing to address cawc’s plans to move forward on a new project the filings are due by march 1 2012 we cannot predict the ultimate effect of the events described above on cawc’s efforts to secure alternative sources of water 

san clemente dam 

the san clemente dam is a 106foot high concrete arch dam located approximately 185 miles from the pacific ocean on the carmel river it was constructed in 1921 and has been operated by cawc since 1966 in 1980 the dosd directed cawc to evaluate the structural integrity of the dam in the event of severe earthquakes or floods that could overtop the dam in 1992 cawc concluded that under certain conditions the san clemente dam might not be stable in the event of a “maximum credible earthquake” the maximum earthquake that appears capable of occurring under the presently known geologic framework the studies also concluded that a “probable maximum flood” the flood that may be expected from the most severe combination of critical meteorological and hydrologic conditions that is reasonably possible in the drainage basin under study could overtop the dam by fourteen feet and cause excessive erosion in the area of the downstream abutments based on these findings dsod ordered cawc to improve the san clemente dam to address these issues 

since 1992 there have been numerous engineering and environmental studies regarding the proposed solution to the san clemente dam’s stability although dam buttressing was originally the favored project of cawc and dsod cawc began to explore dam removal on a parallel track in response to comments made by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration’s national marine fisheries services “nmfs” on dsod’s 1999 draft environmental impact report dsod certified the final environmental impact reportenvironmental impact statement “eireis” in january 2008 the final eireis focused on two possible projects the dam buttressing project and a project to reroute the carmel river and remove the dam the “reroute and removal project” but remained neutral as to which project cawc should pursue 

currently the reroute and removal project is cawc’s preferred project subject to cpuc approval and ratepayer recovery cawc has committed to pay an amount equivalent to the estimated cost of buttressing the dam approximately 49 million the california state coastal conservancy has committed to secure approximately 34 million from state federal and private foundation resources to fund the difference between the approximate cost of dam buttressing and the cost of the reroute and removal project in september 2011 cawc filed an application with the cpuc for authorization to implement the reroute and removal project and to recover through rates the 49 million prospective costs associated with the reroute and removal project over a twentyyear period in addition cawc sought to recover certain historical costs totaling approximately 269 million related to studies to determine whether the dam could withstand a probable maximum flood and or maximum credible earthquake efforts to develop a project to address seismic issues the identification and analysis of possible alternative project options and activities undertaken pursuant to the directives of federal and state government agencies including dsod which is acting as the lead agency under the state and federal environmental review laws 

on november 10 2011 the administrative law judge assigned to the application issued a pd denying recovery of virtually all of the historical costs but providing recovery of the 49 million prospective costs over a twentyyear period the administrative law judge also recommended placing a firm cap on projected costs ie additional unanticipated costs could not be recovered and imposing additional limitations such as exclusion of any equity return from the recovery and reduction of the amount to be recovered based on the appraisal value of land to be donated by cawc in response cawc filed comments with the cpuc contending that the pd is unreasonable unsupported by and contrary to the evidence and contrary to law and policy on january 4 2012 the administrative law judge issued a revised pd recommending that cawc be ordered to show cause why it should not be fined or otherwise sanctioned for an alleged misrepresentation regarding descriptions of the use of the dam as a point of water diversion we believe the administrative law judge’s allegation is meritless and 

  

vigorously disagree with the administrative law judge’s characterization cawc has requested the opportunity to respond to the unfounded allegation and demonstrate that it is invalid 

cawc has met with the cpuc commissioners to communicate the various reasons it believes the pd should be modified or an alternate decision should be issued the pd is currently under review by the cpuc which has delayed issuing a decision on several occasions and most recently has indicated that it will not vote on a decision until april 19 2012 while the company believes there are sound reasons for the cpuc to modify the pd to permit recovery of at least most historical costs and overturn other recommendations adverse to cawc in the event recovery of the historical costs is not permitted the company would among other things incur a charge to earnings with respect to the writeoff of most of the historical costs which currently are reflected in regulatory assets 

endangered species matters 

in 1998 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration the “noaa” listed the south central california coast steelhead trout as threatened pursuant to the federal endangered species act and subsequently designated the carmel river as critical habitat for those trout in 2001 cawc entered into a conservation agreement with noaa requiring cawc to implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the carmel river watershed study the removal of the previously mentioned san clemente dam and explore longterm water sources other than a new reservoir in the carmel river since that time cawc has implemented a number of measures to reduce the impact of its operations on the steelhead trout and other species including pursuing permits to construct the previously mentioned desalination project as an alternative source of water in early 2004 noaa informed cawc of its concern that cawc’s ongoing operations would cause the “take” of significant numbers of steelhead trout during the several remaining years required to implement the desalination project in june 2006 cawc and noaa entered a settlement agreement whereby cawc agreed to fund certain additional projects to improve habitat conditions for and aid in the recovery of steelhead trout in the carmel river watershed under this 2006 agreement cawc was required among other things to make an initial payment of 35 million plus six annual installments of 11 million the settlement agreement required that all payments made by cawc to noaa be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed noaa agreed not to assess any penalties or otherwise prosecute cawc for any “take” of steelhead trout so long as cawc complied with the settlement agreement effective march 3 2009 cawc and noaa executed an amended settlement agreement which supersedes the 2006 agreement to allow the required payments to be made to and managed by a california state agency under an existing mitigation program thereby ensuring that settlement payments will be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed the lack of such assurance caused cawc to delay payments under the 2006 agreement the 2009 amendment also extended the duration of the agreement for an additional year which among other things resulted in cawc’s agreement to make an additional 11 million payment and a one year extension of noaa’s agreement not to assess any penalties or otherwise prosecute cawc for any “take” of steelhead trout consistent with the amended agreement cawc paid an initial 35 million in april 2009 made the first 11 million installment payment in july 2010 the second 11 million installment payment in july 2011 and is scheduled to make the third installment payment in july 2012 and additional installment payments annually through july 2016 the settlement agreement authorizes cawc to terminate these payments once cawc has complied with the state water resources control board’s 1995 order to reduce its diversions 

the cpuc has authorized the recovery through rates of and cawc is recovering the initial 35 million payment and the 2009 installment payment cawc’s application for recovery of the 2010 installment payment is pending before the cpuc and cawc plans to file an application for recovery of the 2011 and 2012 payments in the second half of 2012 

the settlement agreement also requires cawc and noaa to meet and negotiate a resolution to noaa’s concerns regarding changes to cawc’s operations on the carmel river to protect the fish and improve its habitat cawc and noaa have deferred these additional negotiations cawc also undertakes activities to 

  

protect the threatened california redlegged frog and its habitat in the carmel river pursuant to a prior agreement with the us fish and wildlife service “usfws” this agreement has expired and cawc is in discussions with usfws to renew the agreement 

on march 14 2008 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association notified cawc of their intent to file a citizen suit 60 days therefrom for violations of the federal endangered species act alleging the “take” of steelhead trout by cawc along the carmel river and seeking injunctive relief to reduce river water diversions and increase river flow and fish passage facilities on june 25 2009 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association filed suit in united states district court for the northern district of california seeking to enjoin cawc’s pumping on the carmel river the suit was dismissed on cawc’s motion on january 8 2010 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association also filed an administrative complaint with the california state water resources control board in december 2008 claiming that certain fish passage facilities do not meet existing permit requirements the state water resources control board has not acted on this complaint pending the completion of work that cawc is undertaking to improve fish passage at that dam 

other matters 

in addition in november 2010 the ontario ministry of justice commenced a proceeding against terratec environmental ltd one of the company’s canadian subsidiaries alleging the violation of the ontario water resource act in connection with the alleged discharge of anaerobic digestate into a creek that leads to lake ontario terratec has been engaged in negotiations with the ontario ministry of justice to settle this matter and anticipates that penalties will not be material 

periodically the company is involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect the company’s financial position or results of operations however litigation and other proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance it is possible that some litigation and other proceedings could be decided unfavorably to us and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows

executive overview 

general 

american water works company inc herein referred to as “american water” or the “company” is the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served our approximately 7000 employees provide drinking water wastewater and other water related services to an estimated 15 million people in more than 30 states and in two canadian provinces our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial and industrial customers our regulated businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by state regulatory agencies in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters our ongoing regulated businesses currently provide services in 16 states and serves approximately 31 million customers based on the number of connections to our water and wastewater networks we report the results of these businesses in our regulated businesses segment we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state regulatory agencies we report the results of these businesses in our marketbased operations as noted under “business section” our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industrywide factors including but not limited to i economic utility regulation ii economic environment iii the need for infrastructure investment iv an overall trend of declining water usage per customer iv weather and seasonality and vi access to and quality of water supply 

in 2011 we continued the execution of our strategic goals our commitment to operational excellence led to success in portfolio optimization increased regulated operating efficiency and improved performance of our marketbased operations and enabled us to provide increased value to our customers and investors in 2011 our goals were to implement the execution of the portfolio optimization resolve rate cases outstanding at the beginning of 2011 initiate state specific efforts to address the decline in water usage continue improvement in our om efficiency ratio increase our earned rate of return to more closely align with that which is authorized by the pucs selectively expand our marketbased operations’ business as well as optimize our municipal contract operations’ business model 

2011 financial results 

all financial information in this management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda reflects only continuing operations as previously disclosed in our form 10k for the year ended december 31 2010 as part of our portfolio optimization initiative we entered into agreements to sell our regulated subsidiaries in arizona new mexico and our regulated water and wastewater systems in texas the sale of the texas subsidiary assets was completed in june 2011 in addition on july 8 2011 the company entered into an agreement to sell our ohio subsidiary additionally on december 13 2011 we entered in to an agreement to sell applied water management inc which was part of our contract operations line of business within our marketbased segment therefore the financial results of these entities have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods unless otherwise noted see note 3 to consolidated financial statements for further details on our discontinued operations 

  

our results for the year ended december 31 2011 demonstrated significant progress in difficult and challenging economic and regulatory environments we continued to increase our net income while making significant capital investment in our infrastructure and implementing operational efficiency improvements necessary to offset increases in production and employee benefit costs 

despite challenging weather events in the northeast region of the united sates in the third quarter of 2011 for the year ended december 31 2011 we generated 26662 million in total operating revenue and 8031 million in operating income compared to total operating revenue of 25550 million and 7281 million in operating income in 2010 our regulated businesses our largest operating segment generated 23689 million in operating revenue representing 888 of our consolidated operating revenue compared to 22857 in operating revenues representing 895 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2010 this increase of 36 in operating revenues when compared to 2010 was primarily driven by rate increases offset by decrease in sales volume in all customer classes in 2011 additionally for the year ended december 31 2011 our marketbased operations generated 3278 million in operating revenue compared to 2947 million in operating revenues in 2010 an increase of 112 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we reported net income of 3096 million or diluted earnings per share of 175 compared to net income of 2678 million or diluted eps of 153 for the comparable period in 2010 net income for 2011 includes a benefit of 151 million or 009 diluted earnings per share as a result of the benefit from the cessation of depreciation on property plant and equipment and a charge of 251 million or 014 diluted earnings per share to reduce the net asset values of certain of our discontinued operations which include associated parent company goodwill to their net realizable values net income from continuing operations was 3049 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to net income from continuing operations of 2551 million for the year ended december 31 2010 diluted earnings from continuing operations per average common share was 173 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 146 for year ended december 31 2010 in addition we generated increased cash flow from operations during 2011 of 8084 million compared to 7749 million in 2010 

the primary drivers contributing to the increase in net income from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2011 were increased revenues resulting from rate increases as well as slightly higher revenues in our marketbased operations segment partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense and general taxes see “consolidated results of operations and variances” and “segment results” below for further detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations as well as our business segments 

implementation of portfolio optimization initiative 

in 2011 we continued to execute our plan for optimizing our portfolio as part of a strategic review of our business activities the company completed its acquisition of 11 water and 48 wastewater systems in missouri in may 2011 for a purchase price of 33 million leveraging the strength of our largescale operations in that state the acquisition adds an additional 1700 water customers and nearly 2000 wastewater customers to our regulated operations under a separate agreement the sale of the texas subsidiary assets was completed in june 2011 

in january 2011 we announced that we had entered into an agreement with epcor water usa inc to sell 100 percent of the stock of our regulated water and wastewater operating companies located in arizona and new mexico on january 31 2012 we received approximately 4610 million of sales proceeds as a result completing the divestiture of these regulated operating companies we plan to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce equity financing requirements and to pay down commercial paper 

on july 8 2011 we entered into an agreement to purchase seven regulated water systems in new york for approximately 71 million adding approximately 50000 customers to new york regulated operations in a separate agreement american water will sell its eight regulated water systems and one wastewater system in 

  

ohio for approximately 89 million plus assumed liabilities of approximately 31 million for an enterprise value of approximately 120 million ohio american water serves approximately 58000 customers the completion of both transactions is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval by public utility commissions in both new york and ohio we expect the closing on these transactions to occur in the first half of 2012 

on december 31 2011 we completed the sale of awm which was part of our contract operations line of business within our marketbased segment in two separate transactions for combined proceeds of approximately 30 million also in 2011 we continued to bring new water solutions to challenged water and wastewater systems by acquiring several smaller systems in pennsylvania missouri and new jersey

we invested approximately 925 million and 766 million in companyfunded capital improvements in 2011 and 2010 respectively these capital investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations renew aging treatment and network assets provide capacity for new growth and ensure system reliability security and quality of service the need for continuous investment presents a challenge due to the potential for regulatory lag or the delay in recovering our operating expenses and earning an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital in conjunction with our capital program management continued its focus on reducing regulatory lag during 2011 for 2012 we anticipate spending approximately 900 million on company—funded capital investments including expenditures associated with our business transformation project 

during 2011 we continued to move forward with our business transformation project to enhance processes and upgrade antiquated legacy systems in order to generate efficiencies and to better meet our customer needs in a more cost effective manner also during 2011 we decided to accelerate the timeline of this project due to its criticality to the business since the inception of the project we completed our evaluation of appropriate software solutions and selected our software vendor as well as our system integrator we worked with the system integrator to analyze our current processes and to design a blueprint for business processes and new systems that will enable business transformation during 2011 we completed the detailed design and build of the enterprise resource planning “erp” application also in 2011 we began the design of the customer information and enterprise asset management systems 

we expect the erp application to golive in august 2012 and the new customer information system and enterprise asset management system—implemented by the end of 2013 total expenditures spent for our business transformation project through december 31 2011 approximates 1397 million with 1053 million of that amount spent in 2011 

rate cases and regulatory matters 

in 2011 we received authorizations for additional annualized revenues from general rate cases totaling 788 million in april 2011 we received final orders in our tennessee and west virginia rate cases both of which were filed in 2010 on august 1 2011 our virginia rate case which was filed in 2010 and for which interim rates had been in effect under bond subject to refund since the third quarter of 2010 was approved in november 2011 we received final authorizations in our pennsylvania rate case and our hawaii rate case both of which were filed in 2011 

additionally settlements have been reached in our general rate cases in missouri and new york which could provide approximately 30 million in additional annualized revenues if approved in accordance with the settlement agreement there is no assurance that the settlement amounts or any portion thereof will be approved as they are pending regulatory approvals and are all subject to change details of this case will be released upon final approval 

  

on february 23 2012 the iowa utilities board approved an additional 28 million of annualized revenues for our iowa subsidiary the increase approximates what we had been collecting since july 29 2011 under interim rates and the partial settlement that was reached in october 2011 

on february 6 2012 we filed a general rate case in virginia requesting additional annualized revenues for jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional customers of 60 million as of february 23 2012 we are awaiting final orders in seven states where we have continuing operations including missouri and new york where settlement agreements are pending requesting additional annualized revenues of 2455 million of the outstanding cases only one was filed in 2010 five cases were filed in 2011 and the virginia case was filed in 2012 there is no assurance that all or any portion thereof of any requested increases will be granted 

also in 2011 we were granted 262 million in additional annualized revenues assuming constant sales volumes from infrastructure charges in several of our states in january 2012 additional annualized revenue of 17 million resulting from infrastructure charges in our illinois subsidiary became effective 

in addition to our general rate case filings and infrastructure charge filings during 2011 we made other filings including cost of capital preconstruction cost and interim rates trueups we do not expect these filings to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

as disclosed in more detail under item 3 “legal proceedings” in this report our subsidiary california american water company “cawc” filed an application with the california public utilities commission “cpuc” in september 2010 to seek approval for a project to reroute the carmel river and remove the san clemente dam in monterey california the dam is owned by cawc as part of the application cawc is seeking recovery of certain historical costs totaling approximately 269 million related to studies to determine whether the dam could withstand significant flooding and severe earthquakes meeting defined criteria efforts to develop a project to address seismic issues the identification and analysis of possible alternative project options and activities undertaken pursuant to the directives of federal and state government agencies including the california department of water resources division of safety of dams “dsod” the lead agency under the state and federal environmental review laws on november 10 2011 a proposed decision “pd” was issued by the administrative law judge assigned to the matter in the pd the administrative law judge recommended that recovery of virtually all of the historical costs should be denied cawc has filed comments with the cpuc contending that the pd is unreasonable unsupported by and contrary to the evidence and contrary to law and policy the pd is currently under review by the cpuc which has delayed issuing a decision on several occasions and most recently has indicated that it will not vote on a decision until april 19 2012 at december 31 2011 most of the historical charges related to the dam are recorded as regulatory assets on our consolidated balance sheet while we believe there are sound reasons for the cpuc to modify the pd to permit recovery of the historical costs in the event recovery is not permitted we would incur a charge equal to the carrying value of the historical costs included in regulated assets if partial recovery is allowed the effect on regulated assets would be reduced 

continue improvement in om efficiency ratio for our regulated businesses 

our om efficiency ratio a nongaap measure is defined as our regulated operation and maintenance expense divided by regulated operating revenues where both operation and maintenance expense and operating revenues are adjusted to eliminate purchased water expense our om efficiency ratio was 438 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to 455 and 477 for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively we evaluate our operating performance using this measure as it is the primary measure of the efficiency of our regulated operations this information is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of our operating performance om efficiency ratio is not a measure defined under gaap and may not be comparable to other companies’ operating measures or deemed more useful than the gaap information provided elsewhere in this report the following table provides reconciliation between operation and maintenance expense and operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap and to those amounts utilized in the calculation of our om efficiency ratio for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009

 other initiatives 

in 2011 we began addressing regulatory lag in a number of our states in all of the rate cases that we filed in 2011 we addressed declining usage trends additionally in november 2011 the new jersey board of public utilities bpu voted unanimously to publish draft rules that if adopted would implement a distribution system improvement charge “dsic” for specified water infrastructure investments for our new jersey subsidiary the draft rules were published for public comment in december 2011 allowing time for resolution of public comments and final approval april 2012 is the earliest estimate for the rule to become final assuming the rule becomes final new jersey american water company intends to file a foundational filing to support planned investments and under the draft rules the bpu will have 90 days to act on this filing after approval of the foundational filing recovery filings for eligible investments will be semiannual with rates taking effect two months after the filing 

also in 2011 we issued our first full corporate responsibility report securing our position as the first us water and wastewater company to report on environmental social and governance performance against global reporting index guidelines this biennial report includes the company’s priorities policies and approaches to corporate responsibility and covers performance for the 2010 fiscal year as a trusted steward of our most precious resource—water—the company believes having a corporate management approach oriented toward corporate responsibility is key to our longterm success and the ability to provide highquality services to our customers and maintain trust with them and all our stakeholders the report can be found on the company’s web site 

2012 and beyond 

our strategy for the future will continue to focus on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments promoting constructive regulatory frameworks expanding the regulated businesses segment through focused acquisitions and pursuing “regulatedlike” opportunities in our marketbased operations we will also continue to modernize our infrastructure and focus on operational efficiencies 

in particular for 2012 we will focus on continuing our portfolio optimization initiative we finalized our sale of regulated operations in arizona and new mexico on january 31 2012 and expect to finalize the divestiture of our ohio operating company in the first quarter of 2012 also in the first quarter of 2012 we expect to complete the acquisition of the seven regulated water utilities in new york we will continue to identify additional valueadded opportunities 

also in 2012 we will continue to actively address regulatory lag that impacts returns on investments we expect to file four general rates cases as well as file for infrastructure surcharges in four to six states additionally we expect to continue to address declining usage trends via rate case or other filings the demand 

  

for water has been lower than expected in 2011 even though usage volumes for water increased in 2010 compared to 2009 in addition increased water conservation including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers combined with declining household sizes in the united states have contributed to a trend of declining water usage per residential customer all of the states served by our regulated businesses have experienced a declining trend in water usage per residential customer with the rate decline in the various states averaging 21 and ranging between 13 and 342 annually over the last 5 years some of which may have been attributable to variations in weather conditions because the characteristics of residential water use are driven by many factors including socioeconomic and other demographic characteristics of our service areas climate seasonal weather patterns and water rates these declining trends vary by state and service area and change over time our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon operating revenues generated from rates we charge to our customers for the volume of water they use declining usage due to conservation or the economic environment contribute to regulatory lag and will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure appropriate regulatory treatment to offset the usage decline 

additionally in 2012 we will continue to make efficient use of our capital we expect to invest approximately 900 million to upgrade infrastructure enhance infrastructure surcharge like mechanisms and optimize our supply chain process we also expect to continue to improve our regulated om efficiency ratio of which our 5 year goal which began in 2011 is to be below 40 increase our earned regulated return and expand our marketbased operations with a focus on the homeowners services group and military contract operations and optimize our municipal contract operations business model to provide for value creation for both american water and the municipality 

we are committed to operating our business responsibly and managing our operating and capital costs in a manner that serves our customers and produces value for our shareholders we are committed to an ongoing strategy to make ourselves more effective efficient and innovative

operation and maintenance  consolidated operation and maintenance expense for the year ended december 31 2011 increased 109 million or 08 compared to 2010 this change was driven by a 218 million increase in our marketbased operations segment primarily related to the increased capital activity associated with our military contracts partially offset by a 28 million decrease in our regulated businesses segment the remaining 81 million decrease was mainly due to additional expenses in 2010 attributable to a 50 million contribution to the american water charitable foundation a 501c3 organization that was established in december 2010 to encourage and support employees volunteerism and community giving and severance costs of 27 million associated with changes in certain senior management positions for further information see the respective “operation and maintenance” discussions within the “segment results” 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 216 million or 65 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of additional utility plant placed in service 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by 49 million or 24 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was principally due to higher gross receipts taxes of 46 million primarily in our new jersey regulated subsidiary

other income expenses other income and expenses increased 08 million or 03 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year this increase is attributable to an increase in allowance for funds used during construction “afudc” of 42 million resulting from increased construction activity and a decrease in interest expense net of interest income of 14 million partially offset by a decrease in other net the decrease in other net of 58 million is mainly due to the inclusion in 2010 the release of the remaining balance of a loss reserve amounting to 13 million resulting from the resolution of the outstanding issues and uncertainties incremental rental revenues of 26 million and the recognition of funds received related to the methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” legal settlement for 19 million resulting from the outcome of a subsidiary’s rate order 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 244 million or 140 to 1988 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the effective tax rates for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 were 395 and 406 respectively the rate for the twelve months ended december 31 2011 includes a 45 million tax benefit related to one of our operating companies contributing nonutility property to a county authority within its operating area 

income from discontinued operations net of tax as noted above the financial results of our regulated water and wastewater systems in arizona new mexico texas and ohio and our applied water management inc subsidiary within the marketbased operations segment have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented the decrease in income from discontinued operations net of tax is primarily related to a 251 million charge record to reduce the net asset values of those businesses classified as discontinued operation which included associated parent company goodwill to their net realizable values this charge was offset by a benefit of 151 related to the cessation of depreciation for our arizona new mexico texas and ohio subsidiaries in accordance with gaap for the year ended december 31 2011 of 151 million 

net income loss net income for 2011 was 3096 million compared to net income of 2678 million for 2010 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

  

comparison of consolidated results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

operating revenues our operating revenues increased by 2646 million or 116 to 25550 million for 2010 from 22904 million for 2009 regulated businesses’ revenues increased by 2091 million or 101 for 2010 compared to 2009 primarily attributable to rate increases and increased consumption the marketbased operations’ revenues for 2010 increased by 565 million or 237 from 2009 and was mainly attributable to higher revenues in the contract operations and homeowner services groups for further information see the respective “operating revenues” discussions within the “segment results” 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 1086 million or 92 for 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was due to higher operation and maintenance expense in our regulated businesses of 589 million and in our marketbased operations business of 476 million additionally 2010 included a 50 million contribution to the american water charitable foundation a 501c3 organization that was established in december 2010 to encourage and support employees volunteerism and community giving and severance costs of 27 million associated with changes in certain senior management positions for further information on the regulated businesses and marketbased operations variances see the respective “operation  maintenance” discussions within the “segment results” 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 204 million or 66 for 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was due to our continued investment in our infrastructure and capital expenditures many of which were placed into service in 2010 by our regulated businesses this increase was partially offset by the 24 million writeoff of certain software costs in 2009 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by 190 million or 102 in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 this increase was due to higher gross receipts taxes of 67 million primarily in our new jersey regulated subsidiary higher property taxes of 56 million throughout our regulated operations higher payroll taxes of 33 million as a result of our increased wages and salaries for the year december 31 2010 and higher capital stock taxes of 17 million 

impairment charge no impairment charge was recorded in 2010 for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill for our continuing operations totaling 4280 million our regulated businesses recorded a charge to goodwill in the amount of 4262 million and our marketbased operations recorded a charge to goodwill of 18 million the 2009 impairment charge which was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 was primarily related to the high degree of stock market volatility experienced and as of march 31 2009 the sustained period for which the company’s market price was below its carrying value 

other income expenses interest expense net of interest income which is the primary component of our other income expenses increased by 171 million or 58 for 2010 compared to 2009 the increase is primarily due to the refinancing of shortterm debt with longterm debt during 2009 as well as increased borrowing associated with capital expenditures as a result of the volatile market conditions in 2008 the company utilized its shortterm debt credit facilities to fund our capital projects and other operating needs which resulted in higher shortterm borrowings in the first half of 2009 our short term borrowings were steadily reduced during 2009 through a significant number of longterm debt refinancing with fixed interest rates the increase in fixed rate longterm debt resulted in higher interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 allowance for funds used during construction “afudc” increased by 10 million for 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of increased construction activity furthermore other income increased due to higher joint venture income and changes in market value of companyheld deferred compensation other items affecting other income expense include the release of the remaining balance of a loss reserve of 13 million as a result of the resolution of outstanding issues and uncertainties that occurred during 2010 as well as the recognition of funds received related to the mtbe legal settlement for 19 million resulting from the outcome of a subsidiary’s rate order

income from discontinued operations net of tax the change is primarily attributable to the inclusion in 2009 operating expenses of an impairment charge net of tax of 216 million 

net income loss net income for 2010 was 2678 million compared to a net loss of 2331 million for 2009 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

segment results 

we have two operating segments which are also our reportable segments the regulated businesses and the marketbased operations these segments are determined based on how we assess performance and allocate resources we evaluate the performance of our segments and allocated resources based on several factors with the primary measure being income from continuing operations before income taxes 

regulated segment 

the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated businesses for the periods indicated 

 

   

operating revenues our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide services to residential commercial industrial and other customers this business is subject to state regulation and our results of operations are impacted significantly by rates authorized by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate the table below details additional annualized revenues awarded including step increases and assuming a constant volume resulting from rate authorizations granted in 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

    the effective date for the 2011 pennsylvania rate increase was november 11 2011 the virginia tennessee and west virginia increases were effective march 6 2011 april 5 2011 and april 19 2011 respectively the effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2010 were october 1 2010 july 1 2010 april 23 2010 and may 3 2010 in kentucky missouri illinois and indiana respectively rate increases granted in 2010 for pennsylvania and new jersey were not effective until january 1 2011 the effective date for the 2009 pennsylvania rate increase was november 7 2009 

as previously noted an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs such as a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure the following table details additional annualized revenue authorized through infrastructure surcharge mechanisms which were 

  

granted in 2011 2010 and 2009 as these surcharges are typically rolled into the new base rates and therefore are reset to zero when new base rates are effective certain of these charges may also be reflected in the total general rate case amounts awarded in the table above if the order date was following the infrastructure surcharge filing date 

 

 comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

operating revenues increased by 832 million or 36 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the increase in revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through rate authorizations for a number of our operating companies of which the impact was approximately 1338 million partially offset by decreased revenues of 570 million attributable to decreased consumption in 2011 compared 2010 the majority of this decrease occurred in our new jersey and pennsylvania subsidiaries mainly as a result of the extreme weather conditions including the impacts associated with hurricane irene and other severe storms in the northeast region of the united states during the third quarter of 2011 the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and water sales volume by customer class 

 

  

 the following discussion related to water services indicates the increase or decrease in the regulated businesses’ revenues and associated billed water sales volumes in gallons by customer class 

water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for year ended december 31 2011 totaled 13394 million a 393 million increase or 30 over the same period of 2010 mainly due to rate increases offset by decreases in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers 

  

decreased by 33 for the year ended december 31 2011 to 1809 billion gallons from 1871 billion gallons for the same period in 2010 we believe that factors contributing to the decline could include the aforementioned weather conditions in the third quarter 2011 an increased customer focus on conservation the use of more efficient appliances and the current economic climate the extent to which these items individually contribute to the overall decline is difficult to measure 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by 172 million or 38 to 4742 million for the same period in 2010 these increases were mainly due to rate increases partially offset by decreases in sales volume the volume of water sold to commercial customers decreased by 31 for the year ended december 31 2011 to 815 billion gallons from 841 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2010 we believe that factors contributing to this decline include wetter weather conditions an increased customer focus on conservation as well as the current economic environment in certain areas in which we operate similar to the above the extent to which these items individually contribute to the overall decline is difficult to measure 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers totaled 1160 million for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 58 million or 53 from those recorded for the same period of 2010 mainly due to rate increases offset by a slight decrease in sales volume the volume of water sold to industrial customers totaled 393 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2011 a decrease of 15 from the 399 billion gallons for the year ended december 31 2010 

water service operating revenues from public and other customers including municipal governments other governmental entities and resale customers increased 109 million or 37 to 3023 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from 2914 million in the same period of 2010 revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 1269 million for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 71 million compared to the same period of 2010 revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers totaled 1754 million an increase of 38 from the year ended december 31 2010 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 9 states revenues from these services increased by 73 million or 105 to 763 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from the same period of 2010 the increase was primarily attributable to rate increases in a number of our operating companies 

other revenues —other revenues include such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees certain rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year was mainly the result of increased rental revenues 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense decreased 28 million or 03 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 operation and maintenance expense for 2011 and 2010 by major expense category were as follows 

 

   

production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal decreased by 60 million or 22 for 2011 compared to 2010 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 the decrease in our fuel and power costs was primarily due to the decreased water sales volumes the decrease in purchased water is primarily attributable to the decreased usage most notably in our new jersey subsidiary due to wet weather conditions previously discussed as well as in our california subsidiary as customer needs were met with internally produced water the decrease in chemical costs is also due to higher consumption in 2010 as a result of much drier and warmer weather in the northeast region of the united states we also experienced favorable pricing in some of our operating companies in 2011 the waste disposal cost decrease was mainly due to the recognition in 2010 of 19 million of previously deferred costs allowed by a cost recovery mechanism in one of our operating companies 

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and pension expense increased 29 million or 06 for 2011 compared to 2010 these employeerelated costs represented 448 and 445 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2011 and 2010 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table 

 

 the overall increase in employeerelated costs was primarily driven by increased pension expense the increase in pension expense for the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to increased contributions in certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs and revenue requirements are based on the actual cash contributions to our pension trust account this increase was partially offset by lower salaries and wages and group insurance expenses the decrease in salaries and wages for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by vacant positions and lower severance expenses partially offset by increased incentive costs and annual wage increases group insurance decreased mainly due to lower postretirement benefits other than pension as the result of changes to the design of our medical plan and vacant positions as compared to the same period in the prior year 

  

operating supplies and services include expenses for office operation legal and other professional services including transportation expenses information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges overall these costs increased 57 million or 32 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 

 

 the above increases are primarily due to higher contracted services of 65 million for the year ended december 31 2011 mainly as a result of backfilling positions including those left open by employees transferring to our business transformation project as well as the use of contractors for other specific projects additionally 2011 included the recording of an anticipated recovery of expenses related to costs incurred as a result of severe weather storms primarily hurricane irene which have been recorded in their respective expense lines also contributing to the increase was the fact that the same period in 2010 included a reversal of a 35 million payment previously made by our california operating company to the california department of fish and game “cdfg” on behalf of the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration “noaa” this reversal was the result of an advice letter issued by the california public utility commission which allowed for rate recovery of such payment 

maintenance materials and services which includes emergency repair as well as costs for preventive maintenance decreased 25 million or 33 for 2011 compared to 2010 

 

 the decrease of 25 million in 2011 is mainly attributable to lower preventive maintenance expenses throughout our regulated subsidiaries including tank painting meter testing pump tank and well maintenance and paving costs 

customer billing and accounting expenses decreased by 07 million or 15 for 2011 compared to 2010 

 

 the decrease of 20 million in the uncollectible accounts expense was the result of improved collection in our receivables in excess of 120 days this decrease is partially offset by the increase in the other category mainly due to an increase in collection agency fees 

  

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs decreased by 24 million or 62 for 2011 compared to 2010 

 

 the decrease in regulatory expenses was mainly driven by rate case expenses which were deferred in one of our subsidiaries 

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 is primarily due to higher depreciation expense of 205 million resulting from additional utility plant placed in service and increased general taxes of 50 million principally attributable to higher gross receipts taxes in our new jersey regulated subsidiary offsetting these increases is lower operation and maintenance expense as explained above 

income from continuing operations before income taxes the 568 million increase for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year is the result of the aforementioned operating revenue and operating expenses variations 

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

operating revenues increased by 2091 million or 101 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to rate increases and increased consumption the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and water sales volume by customer class 

 

  

 the following discussion related to water services indicates the increase or decrease in the regulated businesses’ revenues and associated billed water sales volumes in gallons by customer class 

  

water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2010 increased 1143 million or 96 from 2009 and is primarily due to rate increases and a slight increase in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers increased by 24 billion gallons or 13 from 2009 we attribute this increase to warmer and drier weather in the midatlantic region of the united states primarily in the third quarter of 2010 partially offset by wetter weather in parts of the midwest region of the united states 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2010 increased by 399 million or 96 mainly due to rate increases in addition to an increase in sales volume compared to 2009 the volume of water sold to commercial customers increased by 23 billion gallons or 28 from 2009 we believe this increase is due to the combination of the aforementioned weather conditions and improved economic environment in certain states in which we operate 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers for 2010 increased by 127 million or 130 from 2009 mainly due to rate increases and an increase in sales volume the volume of water sold to industrial customers increased 43 billion gallons or 121 from 2009 we believe that this increase is due to an improved economic environment in certain states in which we operate 

water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 241 million or 90 from 2009 mainly due to rate increases revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 1198 million for 2010 an increase of 78 million from 2009 revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2010 totaled 1716 million an increase of 163 million from 2009 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 9 states revenues from these services for 2010 increased by 48 million or 75 from 2009 the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rates charged to customers in a number of our operating companies 

other revenues —other revenues include such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items for 2010 other revenues increased by 46 million mainly due to an increase in rental revenues compared to the same period in the prior year 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 589 million or 57 for 2010 compared to 2009 the following table summarizes these expenses by major expense category as follows 

 

   

production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal increased by 146 million or 58 for 2010 compared to 2009 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 the increase in regulated fuel and power costs was driven by higher costs primarily due to increased production volumes the increase in purchased water is primarily attributable to higher costs incurred by our suppliers that are passed on to us the majority of this purchased water increase is in states that permit us to passthrough this increase to our customers without the need for of a full rate proceeding the decrease in chemical costs is primarily the result of favorable contract pricing in addition to favorable water quality due to reduced rainfall in several of our operating subsidiaries waste disposal costs increased primarily due to 19 million related to the recognition of previously deferred costs allowed by a cost recovery mechanism in one of our operating companies as well as increases in sludge removal costs in one of our regulated operating companies 

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and pension expense increased 360 million or 80 for 2010 compared to 2009 these employeerelated costs represented 445 and 435 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2010 and 2009 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table 

 

 a driver of the increase in salaries and wages was due to wage increases higher incentive compensation and severance expenses as well as increased overtime costs of 51 million in certain of our regulated operating companies pension expense increased for the year ended december 31 2010 due to increased pension contributions by certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on the actual cash contributions to our pension trust account this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of actuarial losses attributable to higher than expected returns on plan assets in 2009 group insurance increased due to the deferral of 27 million of costs in 2009 as part of our pennsylvania subsidiary’s rate order the remainder of the cost increase is attributable to the rising cost of health care 

  

operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation legal and other professional services as well as information systems and other office equipment rental charges for 2010 these costs increased by 16 million or 09 compared to 2009 

 

 the increase in operating supplies and services is attributable to higher consulting expenses and increased transportation costs due to higher gasoline prices during 2010 compared to 2009 offsetting these increases is the reversal of the 35 million payment previously expensed by our california operating company to the cdfg on behalf of noaa in 2010 

maintenance materials and services which includes emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance increased 150 million or 247 for 2010 compared to 2009 

 

 the increased costs above were mainly attributable to higher levels of tank painting meter testing pump tank and well maintenance and paving costs throughout our regulated subsidiaries 

customer billing and accounting expenses decreased by 10 million or 22 for 2010 compared to 2009 

 

 the decrease in the uncollectible accounts expense was the result of improved collection in our receivables in excess of 120 days which had a favorable impact of 27 million on our uncollectible account expense partially offset by increased reserves due to higher accounts receivable balances as a result of increased revenues this decrease is partially offset by the increase in the other category mainly due to an increase in collection agency fees 

  

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs decreased by 74 million or 162 for 2010 compared to 2009 

 

 the decrease in insurance expense is primarily due to the positive resolution of prior years’ claims in 2010 compared to 2009 regulatory expenses were higher in 2009 as compared to 2010 due to the writeoff of rate case expenses of 35 million in our california subsidiary in 2009 

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily due to the increase in operation and maintenance expense as explained above higher depreciation expense of 147 million and increased general taxes of 163 million the increase in depreciation expense is attributable to our continued investment in our infrastructure and capital expenditures partially offset by a 24 million writeoff of certain software costs in 2009 the general taxes increase was due to higher gross receipts taxes of 65 million primarily in our new jersey regulated subsidiary higher property taxes of 57 million throughout our regulated operating companies higher capital stock taxes of 17 million mainly in our pennsylvania subsidiary and higher payroll taxes of 19 million as a result of our increased wages and salaries for the year december 31 2010 

income from continuing operations before income taxes the 1067 million increase for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 is the result of the aforementioned changes in operating revenue and operating expenses 

marketbased operations 

the following table provides certain financial information for our marketbased operations segment for the periods indicated 

 

 comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

operating revenues the increase in revenues for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 is primarily attributable to an increase in the contract operations group revenues of 223 million this increase is mainly the result of incremental revenues associated with military construction and operations  maintenance projects related to our water and wastewater contracts of 437 million offset by lower revenues associated with other expired and terminated contracts 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 218 million or 85 for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the year ended december 31 2010 

  

the following table provides information regarding operation and maintenance expense for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 by major expense category 

 

 production costs are comprised of fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal costs the overall decrease in production costs is mainly attributable to decreased fuel and purchased power as well as chemical costs for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of the cessation of costs related to contracts that terminated and expired during 2010 

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and other employee benefits decreased 56 million for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 the decrease in these costs for the year ended december 31 2011 is primarily due to lower expenses related to expired and terminated contracts partially offset by increased costs associated with our military contracts additionally costs were also lower due to reduced headcount attributable to both eliminated as well as vacant positions compared to the same period in 2010 

operating supplies and services consist primarily of contracted services and expenses of office operation legal and other professional services transportation expenses as well as information systems rental charges and other office equipment rental charges the increase in these expenses in 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily attributable to the higher expenses associated with our contract operations group which is related to the increased activity with our military construction projects corresponding with the increase in revenues partially offset by lower expenses due to expired and terminated contracts 

the increase in maintenance materials and supplies of 41 million is primarily due to higher maintenance expenses due to increased contract work corresponding with the increase in revenues 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and uncollectible accounts expense uncollectible accounts expense increased 37 million in 2011 and was mainly due to an increase in accounts writtenoff and deferred revenue advanced billing adjustments in homeowners services 

operating expense the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 is primarily driven by the increase in operation and maintenance expense which is explained above 

income from continuing operations before income taxes the 88 million increase for the year ended december 31 2011 is the result of the aforementioned changes in operating revenues and operating and maintenance expense 

  

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

operating revenues the marketbased operations’ revenues for 2010 increased by 565 million or 237 from 2009 the increase in these revenues was primarily attributable to higher revenues in our contract operations group revenues of 521 million associated with our entry into the industrial operations and maintenance market through an acquisition in december 2009 hereafter referred to as the “contract operations’ acquisition” increased military contract revenues mainly attributable to incremental contract work awarded to us in 2010 the full year effect in 2010 of two new military contracts announced in 2009 and increased revenues in homeowner services mainly as a result of increased product penetration within its existing customer base these increases were partially offset by lower om and design and build contract revenues 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 476 million or 227 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 operation and maintenance expenses for 2010 and 2009 by major expense category were as follows 

 

 the primary driver of the increase is attributable to our contract operations’ acquisition which accounted for 375 million of the increase the remainder of the increase is mainly due to higher costs related to military contracts resulting from incremental construction projects and growth mainly related to the fort meade and fort belvoir locations in addition homeowner services experienced higher contactor repair costs of 36 million due to prior claim trueups coupled with continued growth 

operating expenses the increase in operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 from the same period in the prior year is primarily due to the increase in operation and maintenance expense as explained above higher depreciation expense of 17 million and increased general taxes of 22 million 

income from continuing operations before income taxes the 53 million increase for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 is the result of the aforementioned changes in operating revenue and operating expenses 

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures our business is very capital intensive and requires significant capital resources a portion of these capital resources is provided by internally generated cash flows from operations when necessary we obtain additional funds from external sources in the debt and equity capital markets and through bank borrowings our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets if these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms we have access to revolving credit facility with aggregate bank commitments of 8400 million we rely on this revolving credit facility and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to back our commercial paper program disruptions in the 

  

credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets see “—credit facilities and shortterm debt” 

in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we primarily issue commercial paper which is backed by awcc’s revolving credit facility awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 365 million of outstanding letters of credit under its credit facilities as of december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 awcc had 8135 million available under our credit facilities that we can use to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and back our 4810 million outstanding commercial paper we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated operating companies receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines a reduction in advances and contributions in aid of construction could reduce our liquidity 

we use our capital resources including cash to i fund capital requirements including construction expenditures ii pay off maturing debt iii pay dividends iv fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and v invest in new and existing ventures we spend a significant amount of cash on construction projects that we expect to have a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag see “business—regulation—economic regulation” we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and cash flows from operations since we continue to make investments equal to or greater than our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

the company believes it has sufficient liquidity and ability to manage its expenditures should there be a substantial disruption of the capital and credit markets 

the company expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets on favorable terms before the maturity dates of its current credit facilities in addition the company can delay major capital investments or other funding requirement or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are weighted toward the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation infrastructure investment inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining per customer usage of water weather and seasonality and overall economic conditions 

cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditures requirements we will seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital 

  

expenditure requirements as needed there can be no assurance that we will be able to access such markets successfully on favorable terms or at all operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated 

 

  

  the increase in cash flows from operations for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 is primarily driven by additional revenues in 2011 offset by additional pension contributions and the receipt of a tax refund in the first half of 2010 that did not occur in 2011 

the increase in cash flows from operations during 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in revenues and the change in working capital 

the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1567 million in 2012 of which 404 million was already made in 2012 in addition we currently estimate that contributions will amount to 1321 million in 2013 1551 million in 2014 1488 million in 2015 and 1320 million in 2016 actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates as a result of changes in assumptions and investment returns 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows for the periods indicated 

 

  

   

the increase in our capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2011 is attributable to the construction of and replacement of certain treatment facilities and infrastructure in our pennsylvania subsidiary as well as increased capital spending associated with our business transformation project “bt” as we moved into its design and build phase 

current estimates indicate that bt expenditures could total as much as 280 million prior to any afudc allowed through december 31 2011 we have spent 1397 million on the project with 1053 million spent in 2011 expenditures associated with bt are included in the estimated capital investment spending of 900 million for 2012 and 800 million to 1 billion in the foreseeable future as outlined above as with any other initiative of this magnitude there are risks that could result in increased costs any technical difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative such as implementing a successful change management process may result in delays which in turn may increase the costs of the project and also delay and perhaps reduce any cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the initiative when we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure while we believe such expenditures can be recovered through regulated rates we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely rate recovery of these increased costs associated with this transformation project any such delays or difficulties encountered with such recovery may have a material and adverse impact on our business customer relationships and financial results we believe that the goals of bt—increasing our operating efficiency and effectiveness and controlling the costs associated with the operation of our business—are important to providing the quality service to our customers and communities we serve 

cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to the change in “other investing activities” in 2010 which resulted from the change in the net restricted funds released attributable primarily to the drawdown of the restricted funds by our kentucky and pennsylvania regulated operating companies this increase was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures as a result of delayed construction in the first quarter of 2010 due to the severe weather conditions in certain states in which we operate as well as a higher spending in 2009 on water treatment plant expenditures as a number of facilities were under construction in 2009 

as previously noted in 2012 we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total approximately 900 million and for years in the foreseeable future beyond 2012 we estimate that such investment will be between 800 million and 1 billion annually we intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base while working with regulators in the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment 

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures 

 

   

capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by 1592 million or 208 compared to the same period in 2010 mainly as a result of the increased bt expenditures of 774 million and increased treatment and pumping expenditures of 583 million as a result of certain water treatment plants projects in our pennsylvania new jersey and indiana subsidiaries 

capital expenditures for 2010 decreased by 196 million or 25 from 7853 million in 2009 as a result of delayed construction due to severe weather conditions in the first quarter of 2010 in certain states in which we operate and increased water treatment facility expenditures in 2009 

one avenue to seek growth is through tuckins by helping commissions with troubled water systems as well as other acquisitions that are complementary to our existing business and support the continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt or equity offerings 

the following provides a summary of the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities in the years indicated 

2011 

 

  

 2010 

 

 2009 

 

 in january 2012 we received 4610 million in sales proceeds associated with the divestiture of our arizona and new mexico subsidiaries the proceeds will be used to reduce our outstanding commercial paper and fund company operations 

our investing activities could require considerable capital resources which we have generated through operations and attained through financing activities we can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt mainly through awcc we access capital markets on a regular basis subject to market conditions as a result of the anticipated proceeds from the divestiture of our arizona and new mexico regulated businesses we funded the majority of our 2011 cash requirements with commercial paper which will reduced upon receipt of the proceeds from the transaction 

additionally because of this transaction and our overall cash flows from operations we do not anticipate the need for an equity offering in 2012 in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds this amounted to 223 million 70 million and 212 million for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

  

on may 1 2009 we and awcc filed a universal shelf registration statement that enabled us to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities including common stock preferred stock and debt securities all subject to market demand and ratings status during 2011 and 2010 no common stock or preferred stock offerings were made pursuant to this filling 

pursuant to a public offering in june 2009 the company completed the sale of 145 million shares of common stock at 1725 per share the proceeds from the offering net of underwriters’ discounts and expenses payable by the company were 2423 million the proceeds from the offering were used to repay shortterm debt at the same time rwe continued to divest of its investment in the company during the remainder of 2009 rwe continued to divest of its remaining investment in the company through the sale of additional shares and as a result in november 2009 rwe became fully divested of our common stock the company did not receive any proceeds from the rwe sales of the company’s shares

the following longterm debt was issued in 2009 

 

  

          

  in connection with the contract operations’ acquisition we assumed 40 million of capital lease obligations also in december 2009 we refunded and reissued 931 million of pennsylvaniaamerican water company private activity general mortgage bonds scheduled to mature in 2032 and 2033 the bond’s 360 fixed interest rate expired in december 2009 and the new bonds have a fixed interest rate of 550 with a maturity of 2039 

the following longterm debt was retired through optional redemption or payment at maturity during 2009 

 

 from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements via tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

credit facilities and shortterm debt 

the components of shortterm debt were as follows 

 

 on december 22 2010 awcc our finance subsidiary extended for an additional year a 100 million committed revolving line of credit with pnc bank na which was scheduled to terminate on december 31 2010 awcc chose not to extend this credit line and therefore it terminated on december 31 2011 as such there were no outstanding borrowings under this revolving line of credit at december 31 2011 as of december 31 2010 the outstanding borrowing against this credit line was 27 million this line was used primarily for shortterm working capital needs interest rates on advances under this line of credit were based on the one month libor on the outstanding debt plus 175 basis points for 2010 and 2011 in addition there was a fee of 25 basis points charged quarterly on the portion of the commitment that is undrawn 

awcc has entered into an 8400 million senior unsecured credit facility syndicated among a group of 10 banks this revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire on september 15 2012 is principally used to 

  

support the commercial paper program at awcc and to provide up to 1500 million in letters of credit a majority of the banks agreed to further extend 6850 million of commitments under this revolving credit facility to september 15 2013 we closely monitor events in the financial markets and the financial institutions associated with this credit facility no financial institution has more than 14 of the aggregate commitment through september 15 2012 and from september 15 2012 through the current expiration date of september 15 2013 no institution will have more than 17 of the aggregate commitment if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances the company may request the other lenders to assume the defaulting lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment however the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender’s commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to replace a defaulting lender prior to the credit facility expiration we expect to renegotiate or replace it in order to provide sufficient liquidity to finance operations and capital expenditure the availability of such facility including the amounts for borrowing thereunder and its terms and conditions will depend on the credit markets at the time as well as the company’s credit ratings and operating requirements 

on december 31 2011 and 2010 awcc had the following sublimits and available capacity under the revolving credit facility and indicated amounts of outstanding commercial paper 

 

 awcc had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities and 320 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 21 2012 also as of february 21 2012 awcc had 947 million of commercial paper outstanding 

interest rates on advances under the revolving credit facility are based on either prime or libor plus an applicable margin based upon our credit ratings as well as total outstanding amounts under the agreement at the time of the borrowing the maximum libor margin is 55 basis points 

the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was approximately 041 and 042 respectively 

capital structure 

the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

   

the change in the 2011 capital structure compared to 2010 is mainly attributable to the increase in outstanding commercial paper in 2011 compared to 2010 we used the net proceeds from the sale of our arizona and new mexico subsidiaries to pay down commercial paper 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue debt or access our revolving credit lines we were in compliance with our covenants as of december 31 2011 longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things limit the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions 

certain longterm notes and the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2011 our ratio was 058 to 100 and therefore we were in compliance with the ratio 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets is directly affected by securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets we primarily access the capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we also issue debt at our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities to lower our overall cost of debt on november 30 2011 moody’s investors service which we refer to as moody’s reaffirmed its “baa2” corporate credit rating on awcc and american water and awcc’s “p2” shortterm rating the rating outlook for both american water and awcc is stable on january 30 2012  standard  poor’s ratings services which we refer to as sp reaffirmed its “bbb” corporate credit rating on awcc and american water and awcc’s “a2” shortterm rating sp’s rating outlook for both american water and awcc is stable 

the following table shows the company’s securities ratings as of december 31 2011 

 

 a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flow is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facilities 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy chemicals and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance 

  

of future performance depending on the company’s net position with a counterparty the demand could be for the posting of collateral in the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided the obligation to supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the company’s situation at the time of the demand if we can reasonably claim that we are willing and financially able to perform our obligations it may be possible to argue successfully that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future payments should be sufficient we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends rather than retaining that cash for other purposes we expect that dividends will be paid quarterly to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock will not be cumulative only declared dividends will be paid 

during 2011 2010 and 2009 we paid 1579 million 1503 million and 1373 million in dividends respectively for 2011 we paid a dividend of 023 per share on december 1 and september 1 and 022 per share on june 1 and march 1 for 2010 we paid a dividend of 022 per share on december 1 and september 1 and 021 per share on june 1 and march 1 for 2009 we paid a dividend of 021 per share on december 1 and september 1 and 020 per share on june 1 and march 2 

subject to applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors we will pay cash dividends of approximately 023 per share per quarter in 2012 to be paid approximately 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter the quarterly and annual average aggregate dividend amounts for the four quarters would be 404 million and 1616 million annually the aggregate dividend amounts are based upon 1757 million shares outstanding as of december 31 2011 under delaware law our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our “surplus” which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities minus statutory capital or if there is no surplus out of our net profits for the then current andor immediately preceding fiscal year although we believe we will have sufficient net profits or surplus to pay dividends at the anticipated levels during the next four quarters our board of directors will seek periodically to assure itself of this before actually declaring any dividends in future periods our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient to allow payment of dividends and such opinions may not be forthcoming if we sought and were not able to obtain such an opinion we likely would not be able to pay dividends

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt or equity securities at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us 

  

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business these financial obligations as of december 31 2011 are set forth in the table below 

 

 note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our marketbased operations are not included in the above amounts 

 

           

publicprivate partnerships 

west virginiaamerican water company which we refer to as wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

wvawc leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities was approximately 1592 million at december 31 2011 

performance obligations 

we have entered into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2060 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenues of 20370 million at december 31 2011 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2012 and 2048 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 10760 million at december 31 2011 some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

our financial condition results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we account for these regulated operations in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements use of the authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria 1 thirdparty regulation of rates 2 costbased rates and 3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers 

  

through rates as of december 31 2011 we had concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as a onetime extraordinary item and continued impacts on our operating activities 

regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow for recovery through rates charged to customers regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred as of december 31 2011 we have recorded 10797 million of net regulatory assets within our consolidated financial statements also at december 31 2011 we had recorded 3258 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our statement of operations and financial position could be materially affected 

goodwill 

the company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan at december 31 2011 the company’s goodwill was 11951 million the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values including goodwill on the measurement date if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

for the november 30 2011 impairment test the estimated fair value of the each reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques 

 

   

 the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to each reporting unit’s historic and forecasted cash flows the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers 

the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s fiveyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital 

the company has completed its november 30 2011 annual impairment review and based on this review the company’s goodwill balance was not impaired the company’s fair value calculated in its 2011 impairment test period was greater than the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units 

however there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge 

we also made certain assumptions which we believe to be appropriate that support the fair value of our reporting units we considered in addition to the listed trading price of the company’s shares the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate as a result we concluded that the company’s fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone 

the difference between our calculated market capitalization which approximates carrying value and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulted from an estimated control premium the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling majority interest in the company in estimating the control premium management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace 

for the year ended december 31 2011 no impairment charge was recorded for our continuing operations in 2011 we recorded a charge to goodwill of 255 million relating to parent company goodwill associated with businesses classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2010 no impairment charge was recorded for the year ended december 31 2009 we recorded impairment charges for goodwill in the amounts of 4280 million and 220 million for our continuing and discontinued operations respectively 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions 

  

regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period unbilled utility revenues as of december 31 2011 and 2010 were 1349 million and 1329 million respectively increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and favorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue however since the majority of our customers are billed on a monthly basis total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged 

revenue from marketbased operations is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

accounting for income taxes 

the parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for united states tax purposes members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns 

certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes the company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements these deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse in addition the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences previously flowed through to customers reverse 

  

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations the pension plans have been closed for most employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2006 will be provided with a 525 of base pay defined contribution plan we also maintain postretirement benefit plans for eligible retirees the retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate assumption which is determined for the pension and postretirement benefit plans independently is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices at year end 2011 we began using an approach that approximate the process of settlement obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected bonds the yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 502 532 and 593 at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 505 527 and 582 at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 790 for 2011 2010 and 2009 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 760 for 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

the asset allocations for the company’s us pension plan at december 31 2011 and 2010 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocations for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2011 and 2010 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held directly and through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and post retirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 590 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 410 of the assets are valued using other inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 325 for 2011 350 for 2010 and 400 for 2009 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 800 in 2011 gradually declining to 500 in 2017 and thereafter 

  

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 

 we will use a discount rate and eroa of 502 and 775 respectively for estimating our 2012 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and eroa of 505 and 741 respectively for estimating our 2012 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2011 and 2010 pension and postretirement costs including such expenses charged to our discontinued operations were 873 million and 800 million respectively the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1567 million 1321 million 1551 million 1488 million and 1320 million in 2012 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates 

the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

new accounting standards 

fair value measurements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued updated accounting guidance related to fair value measurements and disclosures that result in common fair value measurements and disclosures between us gaap and international financial reporting standards this new guidance amends current fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to increase transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 the new guidance is to be adopted prospectively and early adoption is not permitted the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

comprehensive income 

in june 2011 the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance allows an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance on october 21 2011 the fasb tentatively decided to propose delaying the effective date of the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments in the new guidance this new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2011 as the company already presents the components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement the adoption of the new guidance will not have an impact on its results of operations financial position or cash flows 

  

testing goodwill for impairment 

in september 2011 the fasb updated the accounting guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment this update permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test that is currently in place under the new guidance an entity will not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines based on the qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount this update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 however early adoption is permitted the company is evaluating the specific provisions of the updated guidance but does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance that amends existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenuegenerating transaction where multiple deliverables exist and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables the guidance is expected to result in more multipledeliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance this guidance was effective for the company beginning on january 1 2011 and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

business combinations 

in december 2010 the fasb clarified the requirements for reporting of pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures for business combinations the accounting update specified that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only the amendments also expanded the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations finalized after january 1 2011 as this guidance clarifies and provides for additional disclosure requirements only the adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

intangibles—goodwill 

in december 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that modifies step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the update requires that for those reporting units an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist the qualitative factors are consistent with existing authoritative guidance which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount this guidance was effective for the company beginning on january 1 2011 the adoption of this update did not have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2011 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in a 48 million decrease in our pretax earnings 

in july 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 1000 million this agreement effectively converted the interest on 1000 million of outstanding 6085 fixed rate debt maturing 2017 to a variable rate of sixmonth libor plus 3422 we entered into this interest rate swap to mitigate interest cost at the parent company relating to debt that was incurred by our prior owners and was not used in any manner to finance the cash needs of our subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2011 and 2010 the interest rate swap reduced interest expense by 24 million and 04 million respectively as the swap interest rates are fixed through april 2012 a hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rates associated with the interest swap agreement would result in a 03 million decrease on our pretax earnings for the year ended december 31 2012 this calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates 

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the ability to recover price increases through rates nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations many of which are unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated activities for both our regulated businesses and marketbased operations our regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and municipal customers while our marketbased operations engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates in addition pension and other benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields 

  

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

our industry 

overview 

the united states water and wastewater industry has two main sectors i utility which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers and ii general services which involves providing water and wastewater related services to water and wastewater utilities and other customers on a contract basis 

the utility sector includes investorowned as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions the environmental protection agency “epa” estimates that governmentowned systems make up the vast majority of the united states water and wastewater utility segment accounting for approximately 84 of all united states community water systems and approximately 98 of all united states community wastewater systems investorowned water and wastewater systems account for the remainder of the united states water and wastewater community water systems growth of service providers in the investorowned regulated utility sector is achieved through organic growth within a franchise area the provision of bulk water service to other community water systems andor the acquisitions including small water and wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers that are in close geographic proximity to already established regulated operations which we herein refer to as “tuckins” 

according to the epa the utility segment of the united states water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented with approximately 52000 community water systems and approximately 16000 community wastewater facilities fiftysix percent of the approximately 52000 community water systems are very small serving a population of 500 or less 

this large number of relatively small fragmented water systems as well as fragmented wastewater facilities may result in inefficiencies in the marketplace since such utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities these inefficiencies may lead to industry consolidation in the future as the larger investorowned utilities acquire smaller local water and wastewater systems larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of significant variations in precipitation and temperatures such as droughts excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread overhead expenses over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale and sharing of best practices companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower costs per unit and improve service at the same time 

the utility sector is characterized by high barriers to entry including the capital intensive nature of the industry investorowned water and wastewater utilities also face regulatory approval processes in order to do business which may involve obtaining relevant operating approvals including certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations from state pucs investorowned water and wastewater systems are generally subject to economic regulation by the state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters for both investorowned and governmentowned water and wastewater utilities 

the general services sector includes engineering and consulting companies and numerous other feeforservice businesses these include building and operating water and wastewater utility systems system repair services lab services sale of water infrastructure and distribution products such as pipes and other specialized services the general services segment is characterized by aggressive competition and marketdriven growth and profit margins 

  

  

the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in constant need of modernization and facilities replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of wastewater discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization the epa estimated that approximately 335 billion of capital spending will be necessary between 2007 and 2026 to replace aging infrastructure and to comply with standards to ensure quality water systems across the united states also the epa estimates that approximately 390 billion of capital spending will be necessary over the next 20 years to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states in addition the american society of civil engineers’ 2009 report card for america’s infrastructure reinforces the urgency to address infrastructure issues associated with aging water and wastewater systems 

capital expenditures related to municipal water supply treatment and distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities are typically funded by water and wastewater rates taxes or the issuance of bonds as a result in order to meet their capital spending challenges many municipalities are examining a combination of privatizations and partnerships with the private sector privatization typically involves a transfer of ownership or responsibility for the operation of the utility from the municipality to the private sector some cases may involve an ownership transfer for specified longterm periods with transfer back to the municipality at expiration of the term of the agreement partnerships between municipalities and the private sector include arrangements like operations and maintenance “om” design build and operate “dbo” design build operatemaintain and design build own operatemaintain and transfer contracts under these types of contracts the municipality either retains ownership or regains ownership of the water andor wastewater system and the private sector takes responsibility for managing and operating the system 

the following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2007 through 2026 for united states water systems 

  

over the next several years we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 800 million and 1 billion per year our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace existing infrastructure as needed and construction of facilities to meet environmental requirements and new customer growth the charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures by asset type and purpose of investment respectively 

 

  

water and wastewater rates 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generate operating revenue from customers based on rates that are established by state pucs through a ratesetting process that may include public hearings evidentiary hearings and the submission by the utility of evidence and testimony in support of the requested level of rates in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on six areas i the amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered “used and useful” in providing public service ii the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service typically by making reference to a representative 12month period of time known as a test year iii the appropriate rate of return iv the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements equitably across the customer base v the quality of service the utility provides including issues raised by customers and vi revenue at existing rates 

water and wastewater rates in the united states are among the lowest rates in developed countries and for most us consumers water and wastewater bills make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services the following chart sets forth the relative cost of water and other public services including trash and garbage collection and sewer maintenance in the united states as a percentage of total household utility expenditures 

  

our regulated businesses 

our core regulated businesses which consist of locally managed utility subsidiaries that generally are economically regulated by the states in which they operate accounted for 24242 million or 894 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2010 our regulated businesses provide a high degree of financial stability because i high barriers to entry provide certain protections from competitive pressures ii economic regulation promotes predictability in financial planning and longterm performance through the ratesetting process and iii our largely residential customer base promotes consistent operating results 

the following table sets forth operating revenue for 2010 and number of customers as well as an estimate of population served as of december 31 2010 for our regulated subsidiaries in the states where our regulated businesses operate 

 

  

   approximately 836 of operating revenue from our regulated businesses in 2010 was generated from approximately 27 million customers in our seven largest states as measured by operating revenues in fiscal year 2010 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our annual operating revenue 

overview of networks facilities and water supply 

our regulated businesses operate in approximately 1600 communities in 20 states in the united states our primary operating assets include approximately 90 surface water treatment plants 600 groundwater treatment plants 1200 groundwater wells 60 wastewater treatment facilities 1300 treated water storage facilities 1300 pumping stations and 100 dams and 49000 miles of mains and collection pipes we own substantially all of the assets used by our regulated businesses we generally own the land and physical assets used to store extract and treat source water typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our regulated businesses we have ongoing main renewal programs in all states in which our regulated businesses operate these programs consist of both rehabilitation of existing mains and replacement of mains that have reached the end of their useful service life 

  

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies purchase supply allocations and mandatory conservation measures these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands we employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm the geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of the effect of weather extremes for the company as a whole in any given summer some areas are likely to experience drier than average weather while other areas will experience wetter than average weather 

our regulated businesses are dependent upon a defined source of water supply our regulated businesses obtain their water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes rivers and streams in addition we also obtain water from wells and purchase water from other water suppliers 

the following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our regulated businesses for 2010 by volume 

in our longterm planning we evaluate quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we use comprehensive planning processes and maintain drought and contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ sophisticated models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored for all supplies so that supply capacity may be predicted and mitigated as needed through demand management and additional supply development 

  

the percentage of finished water supply by source type for our top seven states by regulated businesses revenues for 2010 is as follows 

 

  

  the level of water treatment that we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations surface water sources such as rivers typically require significant treatment while some groundwater sources such as aquifers require chemical treatment only in addition a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water purveyors treated water is transported through an extensive transmission and distribution network which includes underground pipes above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water to the customers’ premises we also have installed production meters to measure the water that we deliver to our distribution network we employ a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption ranging from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices touch read or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collecters the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading 

wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards the treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent and the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of in accordance with local standards 

customers 

we have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our regulated businesses for the purposes of our regulated businesses each active customer represents a connection to our water andor wastewater networks as in the case of apartment complexes businesses and many homes multiple individuals may be served by a single connection 

residential customers make up the large majority of our customer base in all of the states in which we operate in 2010 residential customers accounted for 914 of the customers and 603 of the operating revenue 

  

of our regulated businesses residential customers generally provide for stable operating revenue over time and across regions we also serve commercial customers such as shops and businesses industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we supply water to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities and also provide bulk water supplies to other water utilities for distribution to their own customers 

the following table sets forth the number of water and wastewater customers by customer class for our regulated businesses as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 the following table sets forth water services operating revenue by customer class and wastewater services operating revenue excluding other water revenues for our regulated businesses for 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 substantially all of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption typically on a monthly basis our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption 

customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions particularly during the summer our water systems generally experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can have a downward effect on water operating revenue and operating income conversely when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies thereby reducing customer demand and operating revenue these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands other factors affecting our customers’ usage of water include conservation initiatives including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential 

  

consumers declining household sizes in the united states and deterioration in the economy and credit markets which could have an adverse impact on our industrial and commercial customers’ operational and financial performance 

supplies 

our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals energy and fuel as well as maintenance material and other critical inputs many of these inputs are subject to shortterm price volatility shortterm volatility is partially mitigated through existing procurement contracts current supplier continuity plans and the regulatory rate setting process 

because of our geographic diversity we maintain relationships with many chemical equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace and we do not rely on any single entity for a material amount of our supplies we also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and longterm cost effectiveness as a result of our strategic sourcing process and our strong relationships with suppliers we are able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations for example during hurricane katrina we were challenged to locate chemical suppliers not affected by the hurricane as a result of our previously negotiated and established relationships with a network of preferred suppliers we were able to secure a supply of materials and to continue our operations in the affected areas without interruptions 

we typically have a combination of standby power generation or dual electric service feeds at key facilities multiple water production facilities emergency interconnections with adjacent water systems and finished water storage that keep our operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies 

regulation 

economic regulation 

our subsidiaries in the states in which we operate our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective state pucs the term “economic regulation” is intended to indicate that these state pucs regulate the economic aspects of service to the public from systems that fall within their jurisdiction but do not generally establish water quality standards which are typically set by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” andor state environmental authorities and enforced through state environmental or health agencies state pucs have broad authority to regulate many of the economic and service aspects of the utilities that fall within their jurisdiction for example state pucs issue certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations that typically are required for a company to provide public utility services in specific areas of the state they also must approve the rates and conditions under which service is provided to customers and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate although specific authority might differ from state to state in most states these state pucs approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions and relationships between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions in many instances prior to their completion the jurisdiction exercised by each state puc is prescribed by state laws and regulations and therefore varies from state to state regulatory policies not only vary from state to state they may change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the state pucs in the states in which we operate and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate stayouts and delayed or inadequate rate recovery 

economic regulation of utilities involves many competing and occasionally conflicting public interests and policy goals the primary responsibility of state pucs is to maintain the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and the utility and its stockholders for example it may be cost beneficial to develop a new treatment plant but aquifer and land use concerns may suggest the higher cost alternative of piping the resource to the customer although the specific approach to economic regulation does vary certain general 

  

principles are consistent across the states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate based on the united states constitution and state constitutions that prohibit confiscation of property without due process of law and just compensation as well as state statutory provisions and court precedent utilities are entitled to recover through rates charged to customers prudent and reasonable operating costs as well as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on and recovery of prudent used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers the state pucs will also generally accord a utility the right to serve specific areas and will also provide investorowned utilities with limited protection from competition because the requirement of an investorowned utility to operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations typically prevents other investorowned utilities from competing with it in the authorized area in return the utility undertakes the obligation to provide reliable service on a nondiscriminatory basis to all customers within the authorized area 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to a volumetric charge based on consumption and a base fee component set by a tariff approved by the relevant state puc certain states have approved consolidated rates or singletariff pricing consolidated rates or singletariff pricing is the use of a unified rate structure for multiple water systems that are owned and operated by a single utility but may or may not be contiguous or physically interconnected the singletariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state and based on costs that are determined on a statewide or intrastate regional basis thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for us and our customers for states that do not employ single tariffs we may have multiple general rate cases filed at any given point in time 

the process to obtain approval for a change in rates involves filing a petition or “rate case” with the state puc on a periodic basis as determined by our need to recover capital expenditures and operating costs rate cases are normally initiated by the regulated utility whenever the utility determines it needs to recover increased operating expenses or a return on new capital investment or otherwise determines that its current authorized return is not sufficient given current market conditions to provide a reasonable return on investment a state puc may also initiate a rate proceeding or investigation if it believes a utility may be earning in excess of its authorized rate of return pucs may also impose other conditions on the content and timing of filings designed to affect rates rate cases often involve a lengthy administrative process which can be costly the utility the state puc staff consumer advocates and other interveners who may participate in the process prepare and file evidence consisting of supporting testimony and documentation data from a certain twelve month period of time typically forms the basis for a rate filing and is generally known as the “test year” state statutes and puc rules and precedent usually determine whether the test year should be based on a historical period a historical period adjusted for certain “known and measurable” changes or forecasted data the majority of our states require the test year to be based on a historical period or a historical period adjusted for certain known and measurable changes 

the evidence is presented in public hearings in connection with the rate case these hearings which are economic and service quality factfinding in nature are typically conducted in a triallike setting before the state puc or an administrative law judge during the process the utility is required to provide puc staff and interveners with all relevant information they may request concerning the utility’s operations costs and investments the sworn evidentiary record forms the basis for a state puc decision 

some state pucs are more restrictive than others with regard to the types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their ratemaking processes and how they reach their final rate determinations however in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on the aforementioned six areas 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 failure of the pucs to recognize reasonable and prudent operating and capital costs can result in the inability of the utility to earn the allowed return in addition the decisions of state pucs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete therefore there is frequently a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating cost increase and when those costs are reflected in rates for instance an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not begin to be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until filed and approved in the next rate case by the state puc our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files rate cases with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital that are permitted by the state puc 

our regulated subsidiaries also pursue methods to minimize the adverse impact of regulatory lag and have worked with state pucs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result a number of states in which our regulated businesses operate have adopted efficient rate policies including some form of singletariff pricing forwardlooking test years passthrough provisions or infrastructure surcharges states that have adopted a full or partial singletariff pricing policy include pennsylvania new jersey west virginia kentucky ohio indiana illinois and iowa therefore of our seven largest states five have some form of singletariff pricing 

forwardlooking test years and infrastructure surcharges reduce but may not eliminate the regulatory lag associated with the traditional method of recovering rates from state pucs forwardlooking test year mechanisms allow us to earn on a more current basis a return of our current or projected costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital and other “known and measurable changes” in our business some states have permitted use of a fully forecasted test year instead of historical data to set rates examples of these states include illinois kentucky new york tennessee and california in all states in which we operate on a regulated basis pucs have allowed utilities to update historical data for some changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year this allows utilities to take account of some more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process the extent to which historical data can be updated will generally vary from state to state and depends on whether the changes are known and measurable 

also an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs such as a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure or increases in costs beyond the utility’s control such as purchased water costs this infrastructure surcharge mechanism allows our rates to be adjusted and charged to customers outside the context of a general rate proceeding for prespecified portions of our capital expenditures to replace aging infrastructure closer to the time these capital projects are placed in service since infrastructure replacement is a significant element of capital expenditures made by our subsidiaries such programs can reduce regulatory lag currently pennsylvania illinois missouri indiana new york california and ohio have allowed the use of these infrastructure surcharges these surcharges adjust periodically based on qualified capital expenditures being completed or anticipated in a future period these surcharges are typically reset to zero when new base rates are effective and incorporate the costs of these infrastructure expenditures new jersey california virginia and illinois have allowed surcharges for purchased water costs california has allowed surcharges for power and conservation and new york has allowed surcharges for certain costs such as power and chemicals these constructive regulatory mechanisms encourage us to maintain a steady capital expenditure program to repair and improve water and wastewater systems as needed by reducing the regulatory lag on the recovery of prudent expenditures 

  

also some of the states in which we operate permit passthrough provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs such as purchased power and property taxes to be passed on to and recovered from customers outside of a general rate case proceeding 

another regulatory mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag includes the potential ability in certain circumstances to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is in service instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include pennsylvania ohio kentucky virginia illinois and california 

in addition some states have permitted us to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the pucs assess the prudency of such projects 

in some states the puc has implemented mechanisms to enhance utility revenue stability in light of conservation initiatives decreasing per capita consumption or other factors sometimes referred to as “decoupling” these mechanisms to some extent separate recoverable revenues from volumes of water sold for example the state of california has decoupled revenues from water sold to help achieve their initiative to reduce water usage by 20 by 2020 this progressive regulation enables utilities to focus on conservation as revenues are not tied to sales also as a result of this regulation utilities would be less susceptible to consumption changes as a result of conservation declining per capita usage or other factors affecting consumption likewise new york has implemented a surcharge or credit based on the difference between actual net revenues for the preceding year and the net revenue target as estimated in the most recent rate case 

the infrastructure surcharge passthrough provisions the forwardlooking test year and the allowance of a return on utility plant before it is actually in service are examples of mechanisms that present an opportunity to limit the risks associated with regulatory lag where allowed we employ each of these mechanisms as part of our rate case management program to ensure efficient recovery of our costs and investment and to ensure positive shortterm liquidity and longterm profitability the ability of the company to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case however the company strives to use these and other regulatory policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate it is also our strategy to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater we are also subject to certain regulations regarding fire protection services in the areas we serve these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we also are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently the overall trend has been that they have become more stringent over time we face the risk that as newer or stricter standards are introduced they could increase our operating costs we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our regulated businesses are subject in the past we have generally been able to recover costs associated with compliance related to environmental health and safety standards but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy including responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural resources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are materially in compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards 

  

required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples across our water system are analyzed on a regular basis for material compliance with regulatory requirements across the company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2010 we achieved a score of greater than a 999 for drinking water compliance—a fact that we are immensely proud of—and according to the epa statistics american water’s performance has been far better than the industry average over the last several years in fact in 2009 american water was 43 times better than the industry average for compliance with drinking water quality standards maximum contaminant levels and 81 times better for compliance with drinking water monitoring and reporting requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water the united states epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants with 66 of our 87 surface water plants receiving the program’s “director” award we account for approximately onethird of the 200 plants receiving such awards nationwide in addition 62 american water plants have received the “fiveyear phase iii” award while 26 have been awarded the “tenyear phase iii” award 

safe drinking water act 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly more stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns 

to effectuate the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources in 2006 the epa also proposed revisions to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule in 2011 we anticipate that the epa will propose revisions to the total coliform rule we have been actively involved in the revisions to this rule and were part of a federal advisory committee appointed to negotiate the changes the epa is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants including hexavalent chromium fluoride nitrosamines perchlorate some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds but we do not anticipate that any of these regulations will be completed in 2011 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by pucs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system “npdes” permit program established under the clean water act pursuant to the npdes program the epa 

  

or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems we believe that we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals which generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the united states occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see “business—research and development” 

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters these proceedings are described further in the section entitled “item 3—legal proceedings” 

competition and condemnation 

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct or indirect competition in providing services in our existing markets because i we operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a barrier to market entry our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities and strategic buyers that are entering new markets andor making strategic acquisitions consolidation is changing the competitive landscape as small local utilities struggle to meet their capital spending requirements and look to partner with investorowned utilities we also face competition in offering services to new real estate developers where we compete with others on the basis of the financial terms we offer for our services the availability of water and our ability to commence providing services on a timely basis our largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environnement american states water co and california water services group 

the certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations pursuant to which we operate our regulated businesses do not prevent municipalities and rural water and wastewater districts from competing with us to provide water and wastewater utility services further the potential exists that portions of our subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods 

 

  

  

 the acquisition consideration related to such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter we believe our operating subsidiaries 

  

would be entitled to fair market value for any assets required to be sold and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets 

we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business on september 5 2008 pursuant to a condemnation proceeding californiaamerican water company “cawc” sold the assets of our felton california water system which served approximately 1330 customers to the san lorenzo valley water district the next most recent sale of our water and wastewater systems under threat of condemnation occurred in 2003 we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses 

our marketbased operation 

in addition to our regulated businesses we operate the following marketbased operations which generated 3118 million of operating revenue in 2010 representing 115 of total operating revenue for the same periods of the lines of business outlined below no single group within our marketbased operations generates in excess of 10 of our aggregate revenue 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including om and dbo contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities the food and beverage industry and other customers we typically make no capital investment under these contracts with municipalities and other customers instead we perform our services for a fee during the contract term we may make limited capital investments under our contracts with the united states military and certain industrial customers our contract operations group generated revenue of 2253 million in 2010 representing 723 of revenue for our marketbased operations 

we are currently party to more than 250 contracts varying in size and scope across the united states and canada with contracts ranging in term from two to 50 years included in the these contracts are nine 50year contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems and one 3year subcontract with a municipality acting as primary contractor with the department of defense for similar services on an interim basis until construction of new connections to an existing municipal facility is completed all of our contracts with the us government may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event pursuant to the standard terms of the us government contract termination provisions we would be entitled to recover allowable costs that we may have incurred under the contract plus the contract profit margin the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group through our service line protection program provides services to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial establishments to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking water pipes and clogged or blocked sewer pipes inside and outside their accommodations 

we recently introduced linesaver™ an exclusive program for municipalities and public water systems that is available across the country the linesaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipal system 

  

we entered into our first linesaver™ program partnership with the city of trenton new jersey and are currently discussing partnerships with municipalities across the nation the homeowner services group has also launched the linesaver™ program in burlington iowa 

our homeowner services group has approximately 835000 customer contracts in 17 of the states where we operate our regulated businesses 

terratec environmental ltd 

our marketbased operations also includes our biosolids management group terratec which is located in canada and provides environmentally sustainable management and disposal of biosolids and wastewater byproducts 

competition 

we face competition in our marketbased operations from a number of service providers including veolia environnement american states omi and southwest water particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competitive as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as these fixed term contracts frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process 

longterm opportunities 

in the course of pursuing our longterm strategy and growth initiatives we will concentrate on optimizing our regulated businesses’ portfolio as well as sharpening our focus on our marketbased operations optimization of the portfolio may include acquisition of water or wastewater utilities as well as the divestiture of certain operating companies as the result of the regulatory environment or size 

customer growth in our regulated businesses is driven by i organic population growth within our authorized service areas ii adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water andor wastewater utility systems and iii the sale of water to other community water systems generally we add customers through tuckins of small water andor wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers in close geographic proximity to areas where we currently operate our regulated businesses we will continue to acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuckins the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies historically pursuing tuckins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate certain markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses we will also seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing and new markets before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for quality reliability and compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality standards these acquisitions may include acquisitions of companies that have operations in multiple markets 

while our business mix will continue to focus predominantly on regulated activities we will pursue opportunities in the marketbased operations that are complementary to our regulated businesses and our capabilities our focus will center around publicprivate partnerships including municipalities and divisions of the united states department of defense as well as industrial customers we will continue to capitalize on our 

  

om expertise and our existing municipal and federal government relationships while building on our customer base in the industrial sector in identifying and bidding for new ventures that have attractive risk and return characteristics we will also expand our homeowner services business with homeowners and smaller commercial establishments in areas within and beyond our existing regulated footprint 

currently management is performing a strategic review of american water’s portfolio of regulated and marketbased business activities designed to identify potential opportunities for achieving a more rationalized portfolio cost structure improvements and an enhanced financial profile as a consequence of this review management may dispose of certain assets or operations or acquire others 

in december 2010 we announced that our subsidiary missouriamerican water company “mawc” entered into an agreement to purchase 11 regulated water systems and 59 wastewater systems in missouri for approximately 3 million the transaction which requires approval by the missouri public service commission expands mawc’s presence in missouri by approximately 10000 people also at the same time we announced that we entered into a separate agreement to sell our regulated 51 water and five wastewater systems in texas for approximately 6 million texasamerican water company serves approximately 16000 people in the greater houston metropolitan area the acquisition requires approval by the texas commission on environmental quality this transaction is a way to strengthen our operations by creating better economies of scale and providing additional opportunities for both companies to continue providing excellent local customer service 

in january 2011 we announced that we had entered into an agreement with epcor water usa inc “epcor usa” to sell 100 percent of the stock of our regulated water and wastewater operating companies located in arizona and new mexico for an estimated sale price of 470 million subject to certain adjustments our total investment in both subsidiaries was approximately 450 million as of december 31 2010 we plan to use the proceeds from the sale to reduce both equity and debt financing the completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approval by the pucs in both arizona and new mexico 

research and development 

we established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our business our research and development personnel are located in new jersey in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports research through sophisticated testing and analysis since its inception our research and development program has evolved to become a leading waterrelated research program achieving advancements in the science of drinking water including sophisticated water testing procedures and desalination technologies 

since the formation of the epa in 1970 we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa has helped us to achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

in 2010 we spent 277 million on research and development which represents an increase of 07 over the 275 million spent in 2009 we spent 25 million on research and development costs in 2008 approximately onequarter of our research budget is comprised of competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers 

  

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical in providing quality and reliable service at reasonable rates maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

support services 

our american water works service company subsidiary provides shared services and corporate governance that achieve economies of scale through central administration these services are provided predominantly to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services which are provided at cost may include accounting administration business development corporate secretarial education and training engineering financial health and safety human resources information systems legal operations procurement rates security risk management water quality and research and development limited services are also provided to our marketbased operations these arrangements afford our operating companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis 

we operate two national customer service centers which are located in alton illinois and pensacola florida and employ approximately 700 people in total 

our security department provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing implementing monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs we are in contact with federal state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply 

employee matters 

currently we employ approximately 7600 fulltime employees of these approximately 3700 or 49 are represented by unions we have 84 collective bargaining agreements in place with 18 different unions representing our unionized employees in september 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement the company implemented our “last best and final” offer in order not to disrupt health care coverage for our employees at this time we don’t believe that this circumstance will result in a system wide work stoppage however management has developed contingency plans that will be implemented as necessary if a work stoppage or strike does occur management does not expect that such a work stoppage or strike would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company over onethird of our local union contracts will expire during 2011 in addition to the expired national benefit agreement seven local union contracts covering approximately 1000 employees expired without a new agreement being reached prior to december 31 2010 in regards to these contracts there have been no work stoppages

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position or results of operations which in turn could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

risks related to our industry and business 

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation decisions by state pucs and other regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are economically regulated by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses to enable us to finance the addition of new or the replacement of existing water and wastewater infrastructure and to allow us the opportunity to earn what they determine to be an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

our ability to meet our financial objectives depends upon the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted even if approved there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses and the recovery of our investment andor provide us an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment if the authorized rates are insufficient to cover operating expenses to allow for the recovery of our investment and to provide an appropriate return on invested capital or if rate increase decisions are delayed our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital andor a return of our invested capital that are permitted by state pucs as billings to customers are based on usage rather than a fixed amount 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations compliance with increasingly stringent laws and regulations could impact our operating costs and violations of such laws and regulations could subject the company to substantial liabilities and costs 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local laws and regulations and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements 

  

include the united states clean water act of 1972 which we refer to as the clean water act and the united states safe drinking water act of 1974 which we refer to as the safe drinking water act the amendments to and reauthorizations of the clean water and safe drinking water acts and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs or damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to a company not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws and regulations and other health and safety and water quality regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement have tended to become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases to recover such costs or that such costs will not adversely and materially affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations requiring us to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused adverse environmental impacts the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by our insurance policies and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control and changes in certain agreements can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

any governmental entity that regulates our operations may enact new legislation or adopt new regulations or policies at any time and new judicial decisions may change the interpretation of existing legislation or regulations at any time the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or changes in agency policy including those as a response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these changes or any other changes in laws regulations judicial decisions or agency policies applicable to us may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

availability of water supplies restrictions on use natural hazards weather conditions and competing uses may interfere with our sources of water demand for water services and our ability to supply water to customers 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as such we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights based on statutory or common law principles and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements can change from time to time and adversely impact our water supply drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water for example in our monterey county ca operations in order to augment our sources of water supply we have implemented conservation rates and other programs to address demand and are utilizing aquifer storage and recovery facilities to store winter water for summer use in december 2010 we obtained approval from the state puc for construction of a regional desalination plant which is intended to provide an alternate water source for the monterey peninsula 

governmental restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas if a regional drought were to occur affecting our service areas and adjacent systems governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system there were voluntary conservation efforts or water use restrictions implemented during certain periods of 2010 in parts of virginia following drought conditions water demand may not return to predrought levels even after restrictions are lifted 

service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas these include winter storms and freezing conditions in our colder climate service areas high wind conditions in our service 

  

areas known to experience tornados earthquakes in our service areas known to experience seismic activity high water conditions for our facilities located in or near designated flood plains hurricanes in our coastal service areas and severe electrical storms which are possible across all of our service areas these weather events may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage any interruption in our ability to supply water or to collect treat and properly dispose of wastewater or any costs associated with restoring service could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore losses from business interruptions or damage to our facilities might not be covered by our insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

declining water usage per residential customer may reduce our longterm revenues financial condition and results of operations 

increased water conservation including through the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers combined with declining household sizes in the united states has contributed to a trend of declining water usage per residential customer our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use the rate we charge for our water is regulated by state pucs and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect changes in demand declining usage will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or to grow our residential customer base to the extent necessary to offset the residential usage decline 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection or sewage systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages which may not be recoverable in rates this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition moreover in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow our losses might not be covered by insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we suffer delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is very capital intensive we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2010 we invested 7656 million in net companyfunded capital improvements we expect the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems could increase in the future we fund these projects from cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and through the issuance of longterm debt and equity securities we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all 

in addition we believe that our dividend policy could limit but not preclude our ability to pursue growth in particular this limitation could be significant for example with respect to large acquisitions and growth opportunities that require cash investments in amounts greater than our available cash or external financing resources in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions including tuckin acquisitions principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend 

  

policy we expect that we will need additional financing however we intend to retain sufficient cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we may fail to maintain our existing property plant and equipment realize our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and successfully expand the rate base upon which we are able to earn future returns on our investment and a return of our investment even if we have adequate resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital expenditures on time as a result of construction delays or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we also face the risk that after we make substantial capital expenditures the rate increases granted to us by state pucs may not provide a sufficient opportunity to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses and to allow us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

our business is impacted significantly by weather conditions which are subject to fluctuations these fluctuations could adversely affect demand for our water service and our revenues 

demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other outside water use throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months demand tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal if there is more rainfall than normal andor rainfall is more frequent than normal the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we own approximately 100 dams a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and downstream property damage for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

we also are required from time to time to decommission repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs can be and has been material we might not be able to recover such costs through rates the inability to recover these higher costs or regulatory lag in the recovery of such costs can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams in monterey county ca we filed an application with the california public utilities commission “cpuc” on september 22 2010 to seek approval for removal of the san clemente dam on the carmel river the application includes a proposal that certain funding for the project would come from state and federal sources we can provide no assurances that any state or federal funding will be made available 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in reservoirs located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators including state pucs with 

  

jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance at acceptable rates in the future 

contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries to civil or criminal enforcement actions private litigation and cleanup obligations 

our water supplies are subject to contamination including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether “mtbe” and possible terrorist attacks in the event that our water supply is contaminated we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply of water from another water source including in some cases through the purchase of water from a thirdparty supplier in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods if we are unable to substitute water supply in a costeffective manner our financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected we might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort contractual obligations or other lawsuits or criminal enforcement actions or other consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 

our business transformation initiative “bt” involves risks could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and profitability 

we have undertaken a business transformation project which is intended to upgrade our antiquated and manual processes and systems this multiyear enterprisewide initiative is intended to support our broader strategic initiatives the project is intended to optimize workflow throughout our field operations improve our backoffice operations and enhance our customer service capabilities the scale and anticipated future costs associated with the business transformation project are significant and we could incur significant costs in excess of what we are planning to spend any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may result in delays which in turn may increase the costs of the project when we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure further we may not realize the cost improvements and greater efficiencies we hope for as a result of the project in addition we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely or adequate rate recovery of these increased costs associated with the transformation project 

currently we operate numerous systems that have varying degrees of integration which can lead to inefficiencies workarounds and rework as such delays in the initiative being put into service will also delay cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the project we may also experience difficulties consolidating our current systems moving to a common set of operational processes and implementing a successful change management process these difficulties may impact our customers and our ability to meet their needs efficiently any such delays or difficulties may have a material and adverse impact on our business client relationships and financial results 

our liquidity and earnings could be adversely affected by increases in our production costs including the cost of chemicals electricity fuel or other significant materials used in the water and wastewater treatment process 

we incur significant production costs in connection with the delivery of our water and wastewater services our production costs are driven by purchased water chemicals used to treat water and wastewater as well as 

  

electricity and fuel which are used to operate pumps and other equipment used in water treatment and delivery and wastewater collection treatment and disposal we also incur production costs for waste disposal for 2010 production costs accounted for 235 of our total operations and maintenance costs these costs can and do increase sometimes unexpectedly and in substantial amounts 

our regulated businesses might not be able to recover increases in the costs of chemicals electricity fuel other significant inputs or waste disposal through rates or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner our marketbased businesses may not be able to recover these costs in contract prices or other terms the inability to recover these higher costs can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

risks associated with potential acquisitions or investments may adversely affect us 

we will continue to seek to acquire or invest in additional regulated water andor wastewater systems that we believe will permit us to achieve a more rationalized portfolio cost structure improvements and an enhanced financial profile including acquiring systems in markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses and through tuckins we will also continue to seek to enter into related marketbased businesses and services that complement our businesses these transactions may result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may also experience difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals for acquisitions and any regulatory approvals we obtain may require us to agree to costly and restrictive conditions imposed by regulators we may not identify all significant risks when conducting due diligence for a transaction and we could be exposed to potential liabilities for which we will not be indemnified there may be difficulties integrating new businesses including bringing newly acquired businesses up to the necessary level of regulatory compliance retaining and integrating key personnel achieving strategic objectives and integrating acquired assets and technological systems the demands of identifying and transitioning newly acquired businesses or pursuing investment opportunities may also divert management’s attention from other business concerns and otherwise disrupt our business any of these risks may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

risks associated with potential disposition of certain assets may adversely affect us  

the company is performing a strategic review of its portfolio of regulated and marketbased business activities designed to identify potential opportunities for achieving a more rationalized portfolio cost structure improvements and an enhanced financial profile as a consequence of this review management may determine to seek to dispose of certain assets or operations the demands of identifying and transitioning newly disposed businesses may divert management’s attention from other business concerns and otherwise disrupt our business we may also experience difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals for dispositions and any regulatory approvals we obtain may require us to agree to costly and restrictive conditions imposed by regulators any of these risks may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

  

capital markets have experienced a significant period of dislocation and instability which could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on our revolving credit facility commercial paper programs and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we borrowed under our existing 840 million revolving credit facility commitments under this revolving credit facility of 685 million mature on september 15 2013 and the remaining 155 million of commitments expire on september 15 2012 american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities and 364 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 22 2011 awcc had 1947 million of outstanding commercial paper as of february 22 2011 we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures 

the resulting lack of available credit and increased volatility in the financial markets or changes to our credit ratings could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and our ability to manage our liquidity in particular as a result of higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities increased commercial paper borrowing costs and increased costs related to variable rate debt the company’s interest expense could increase and adversely impact our results of operations 

the capital market disruptions could result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased commercial paper borrowing costs as a result continuation of the market disruptions could increase the company’s interest expense and adversely impact our results of operations 

market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations which may affect investment returns that may fall below the company’s projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets will increase the funding requirements under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value additionally the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans also future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates and our results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected 

  

our reliance on thirdparty suppliers poses significant risks to our business and prospects 

we contract with third parties for goods and services that are essential to our operations such as maintenance services pipes chemicals electricity water gasoline diesel and other materials we are subject to substantial risks because of our reliance on these suppliers for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 as a result of any of these factors we may be required to find alternative suppliers for the raw materials and services on which we rely accordingly we may experience delays in obtaining appropriate raw materials and services on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities from such alternative suppliers at a reasonable price which could interrupt services to our customers and adversely affect our revenues financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations or require us to effect additional dilutive equity issuances 

our total assets include substantial goodwill at december 31 2010 our goodwill totaled 12507 million the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of rwe in 2003 and the acquisition of e’town corporation in 2001 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable annual impairment reviews are performed at november 30 of each year and interim reviews are performed when management determines that a triggering event has occurred we have been required to reflect as required by the applicable accounting rules noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairments in the past in the first quarter of 2009 we recorded a noncash charge to operating results for a goodwill impairment in the amount of 4500 million in addition we recorded noncash charges to operating results for a goodwill impairment in the amounts of 7500 million 5093 million and 2278 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these amounts include impairments relating to discontinued operations as a result of these impairments net income was reduced by 4430 million 7385 million 5015 million and 2236 million in 2009 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

the company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

  

our regulated businesses compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities as well as strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities which may hinder our ability to grow our business 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities as well as strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities including tuckins our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities near our existing operations thereby preventing us from acquiring them competing governmental entities utilities and strategic and financial buyers have challenged and may in the future challenge our applications for new service territories our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new territories with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations or that can submit more attractive bids 

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized movements may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through the governmental power of eminent domain should a municipality or other government subdivision seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain we may resist the acquisition contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated business’s management from the operation of its business 

on september 5 2008 under threat of condemnation cawc sold the assets of our felton california water system which served approximately 1330 customers to the san lorenzo valley water district if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges 

we may not be able to fully utilize our us and state net operating loss carryforwards 

as of december 31 2010 we had us federal and state net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 11853 million and 7147 million respectively our federal nol carryforwards begin to expire in 2024 and our state nol carryforwards will expire between 2011 and 2030 our ability to utilize our nol carryforwards is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income moreover because the rwe divestiture was considered an “ownership change” under section 382 of the internal revenue code the amount of nol carryforwards that may be utilized in any year is limited our management believes the federal nol carryforwards are more likely than not to be recovered and currently require no valuation allowance the establishment or increase of a valuation allowance would increase our deferred income tax assets and reduce our net income however at december 31 2010 2743 million of the state nol carryforwards have been offset by a valuation allowance because the company does not believe these nols are more likely than not be realized in the future 

our actual results may differ from those estimated by management in making its assessment as to our ability to use the nol carryforwards moreover changes in income tax laws the economy and general business environment could affect the future utilization of the nol carryforwards if we are unable to fully utilize our nol carryforwards to offset taxable income generated in the future our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

our marketbased operations through american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees and other forms of financial security to our publicsector and public clients that could be claimed by our clients or potential clients if we do not meet certain obligations 

under the terms of some of our indebtedness and some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding its regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of the performance of our marketbased operations including financial guarantees or deposits to ensure performance of certain obligations at 

  

december 31 2010 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 32790 million and this amount is likely to increase if our marketbased operations grow the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms all of our contracts with the department of defense for the operation and maintenance of water and wastewater systems may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract the contract price for each of these military contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions in addition if the obligor on the instrument fails to perform certain obligations to the satisfaction of the party that holds the performance commitments that party may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to maintain those systems which will negatively affect us as the operators of the systems 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner to undertake capital improvements in some cases we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner 

our marketbased operations are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received 

some of our marketbased operations enter into longterm contracts pursuant to which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee our marketbased operations are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party in addition directly or through our marketbased subsidiaries we often guarantee our marketbased operations’ obligations under those contracts losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity 

we rely on our information technology “it” systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and cause our results of operations to be reduced we depend on our it systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections our it systems also allow us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers our it systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 such damages or interruptions may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and similar events in addition the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact on the company of any of the foregoing events 

in addition we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2010 our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 57080 million and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our credit facilities or be required to issue new debt securities in the capital markets we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets or do so on favorable terms if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business that would prevent us from maintaining or increasing our business and cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 

our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger prepayment obligations 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in us being required to repay or refinance on less favorable terms 

  

these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to repay or refinance on less favorable terms these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates in 2007 we were not in compliance with reporting covenants contained in some of the debt agreements of our subsidiaries such defaults under the reporting covenants were caused by our delay in producing our 2006 quarterly and audited annual consolidated financial statements we have obtained all necessary waivers under the agreements we can provide no assurance that we will comply in the future with all our reporting covenants and will not face an event of default under our debt agreements or that such default will be cured or waived 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

currently approximately 3700 of our employees or 49 of our total workforce are unionized and represented by 18 different unions approximately onethird of our 84 union collective bargaining agreements expire annually with 38 agreements covering 1546 employees scheduled to expire before the end of 2011 we might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are favorable to us and negotiations or dispute resolutions undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or become subject to the risk of labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may all adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flows and liquidity in 2010 we declared “impasse” in negotiations of our national benefits agreement with most of the labor unions representing employees in our regulated businesses the prior agreement expired on july 31 2010 however negotiations did not produce a new agreement the company implemented our “last best and final” offer in order not to disrupt health care coverage for our employees we cannot provide assurance that a work stoppage or strike would not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting existed during 2009 if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis any inability to report and file our financial results in an accurate and timely manner could harm our business and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock 

as a public company we are required to comply with the sarbanesoxley act and other rules and regulations that govern public companies in particular we are required to certify our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act for the year ended december 31 2010 which requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” however from 2003 until the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008 as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe we were not required to maintain a system of effective internal controls or comply with the requirements of the sec and the sarbanesoxley act nor to prepare our own consolidated financial statements in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2006 we and our independent registered public accountants identified six material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting each of which could have resulted in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements since that time we have addressed all areas of material weakness as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2010 we and our independent registered public accountants have tested the effectiveness of controls designated to address the weaknesses and based on the results of these tests no longer consider these control deficiencies to be material weaknesses for further discussion see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—our internal control and remediation initiatives” moreover we cannot provide assurance that we have identified all or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses any of which may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and cause future delays in filing our financial statements and periodic reports with the sec any such delays in the filing of our financial statements and 

  

periodic reports may result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions could be imposed on us by the sec we believe that any such misstatements or delays could negatively impact our liquidity access to capital markets financial condition and the market value of our common stock or cause a downgrade in the credit ratings of american water or awcc 

we may be required to adopt international financial reporting standards “ifrs” or other accounting or financial reporting standards the ultimate adoption of which could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

we could be required to adopt ifrs or other accounting or financial reporting standards different from gaap in the united states of america which is currently applicable to our accounting and financial reporting in 2008 the sec released a timetable for the adoption of ifrs according to which we could be required to adopt ifrs by 2016 under gaap we are subject to the accounting procedures for accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation which among other things allow us to defer certain costs if we believe it is probable that we will be allowed to recover those costs by future rate increases currently ifrs does not contain provisions equivalent to the current gaap accounting procedures the implementation and adoption of new accounting or financial reporting standards could affect our reported performance which in turn could favorably or unfavorably impact our business financial condition or results of operations furthermore the transition to and application of new accounting or financial reporting standards could result in increased administrative costs 

derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses 

we are party to an interest rate swap contract with a financial institution to hedge against the fair value of our debt and may enter into additional interest rate swap contracts in the future changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are not cash flow hedges and thus are reported in income and accordingly could materially affect our reported income in any period in addition our hedging strategy may not be effective to mitigate adverse effects on our profitability during any period in which interest rates change and the costs of this hedging strategy may exceed the benefits moreover in the light of current economic uncertainty and financial institution failures in the recent past we may be exposed to the risk that our counterparty in a derivative transaction may be unable to perform its obligations as a result of being placed in receivership or otherwise in the event that a counterparty to a material derivative transaction is unable to perform its obligations thereunder we may experience material losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

the global economic and financial market environment may adversely affect our business and operations 

the existing and continuing global economic and financial market environment has caused among other things a general tightening in the credit markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending and lower consumer net worth all of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our customers and suppliers may or will be severely affected by the current economic turmoil current or potential customers and suppliers may no longer be in business may be unable to continue to pay for our services or may decide to reduce their consumption of our services all of which could lead to reduced demand for our services reduced operating income an increased incidence of customer payment delays or defaults for services delivered further suppliers may not be able to supply us in a timely manner may increase prices or go out of business which could result in our inability to meet consumer demand as such a continuing negative global economic and financial market environment could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in 1995 the california state water resources control board issued an administrative order to cawc requiring cawc to implement an alternative water supply in lieu of diversions from the carmel river the state water resources control board held new administrative hearings in the summer of 2008 to address claims that cawc has exceeded its water diversion rights in the carmel river and has not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by the state water resources control board’s 1995 order the state water resources control board adopted a cease and desist order applicable to cawc on october 20 2009 the 2009 order finds that cawc has not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river as required by the 1995 order the 2009 order requires among other things that cawc significantly decrease its yearly diversions from the carmel river according to a set reduction schedule running from the date the order was adopted until december 31 2016 at which point all unpermitted diversions must end the 2009 order also requires that cawc plan design and implement within twentyfour months of the date the order was adopted projects designed to reduce the need for carmel river diversions we have appealed the 2009 order to the superior court of california challenging the findings and requirements of that order we can provide no assurances however that the appeal will be successful or that if unsuccessful we will be able to comply with the requirements under the 2009 order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to us on december 2 2010 the state puc approved cawc’s participation in a regional desalination project which when operating is intended to fulfill cawc’s obligation under the 1995 order in addition to other obligations 

in 1998 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which we refer to as noaa listed the south central california coast steelhead trout as threatened pursuant to the federal endangered species act and subsequently designated the carmel river as critical habitat for those trout in 2001 cawc entered into a 

  

conservation agreement with noaa requiring cawc to implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the carmel river watershed study the removal of the san clemente dam and explore longterm water sources other than a new reservoir in the carmel river since that time cawc has implemented a number of measures to reduce the impact of its operations on the steelhead trout and other species including pursuing permits to construct the previously mentioned desalination project as an alternative source of water in early 2004 noaa informed cawc of its concern that cawc’s ongoing operations would cause the “take” of significant numbers of steelhead trout during the several remaining years required to implement the desalination project in june 2006 cawc and noaa entered a settlement agreement whereby cawc agreed to fund certain additional projects to improve habitat conditions for and aid in the recovery of steelhead trout in the carmel river watershed under this 2006 agreement cawc is required among other things to make an initial payment of 35 million plus six annual installments of 11 million the settlement agreement requires that all payments made by cawc to noaa be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed noaa has agreed not to assess any penalties or otherwise prosecute cawc for any “take” of steelhead trout so long as cawc complies with the settlement agreement effective march 3 2009 the company and noaa executed an amended settlement agreement to allow the required payments to be made to and managed by a california state agency under an existing mitigation program thereby ensuring that settlement payments will be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed the 2009 amendment also extended the duration of the agreement for an additional year consistent with the amended agreement the company paid an initial 35 million in april 2009 made the first 11 million installment payment in july 2010 and is scheduled to make the second 11 million installment payment in july 2011 the settlement agreement also requires the company and noaa to meet and negotiate a resolution to noaa’s concerns regarding changes to the company’s operations on the carmel river to protect the fish and improve its habitat the company and noaa are currently engaged in this second phase of negotiations on march 14 2008 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association notified cawc of their intent to file a citizen suit 60 days therefrom for violations of the federal endangered species act alleging the “take” of steelhead trout by cawc along the carmel river and seeking injunctive relief to reduce river water diversions and increase river flow and fish passage facilities on june 25 2009 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association filed suit in united states district court for the northern district of california seeking to enjoin the company’s pumping on the carmel river the suit was dismissed on the company’s motion on january 8 2010 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association also filed an administrative complaint with the california state water resources control board in december 2008 claiming that certain fish passage facilities do not meet existing permit requirements cawc also undertakes activities to protect the threatened california redlegged frog and its habitat in the carmel river pursuant to a prior agreement with the us fish and wildlife service “usfws” this agreement is currently expired and cawc is in discussions with usfws to renew the agreement 

in october 2010 a proceeding was commenced against american water canada corporation our canadian subsidiary and its client alleging the violation of the ontario safe drinking water act in connection with the temporary failure of an alum pump used for disinfection of the elgin area drinking water system the company believes it has valid defenses to these allegations and intends to vigorously defend them while it is possible the consequence of the proceeding could result in penalties the company does not anticipate they will be material 

in addition in november 2010 a proceeding was commenced against terratec environmental ltd one of our canadian subsidiaries alleging the violation of the ontario water resource act in connection with the alleged discharge of anaerobic digestate into a creek that leads to lake ontario the company has not received discovery from the government regarding this matter while it is possible the consequence of the proceeding could result in penalties the company does not anticipate they will be material

executive overview 

general 

american water works company inc herein referred to as “american water” or the “company” is the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served our more than 7000 employees provide drinking water wastewater and other water related services to approximately 15 million people in more than 30 states and in two canadian provinces our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial and industrial customers our regulated businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by state regulatory agencies in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters our regulated businesses currently provide services in 20 states and in 2010 served approximately 33 million customers based on the number of connections to our water and wastewater networks we report the results of these businesses in our regulated businesses segment we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state regulatory agencies we report the results of these businesses in our marketbased operations as noted under “business section” our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industrywide factors including but not limited to i economic utility regulation ii economic environment iii the need for infrastructure investment iv an overall trend of declining water usage per customer iv weather and seasonality and vi access to and quality of water supply 

in 2010 we continued to execute on our strategy of providing value to our customers and shareholders by delivering solid financial results making capital investments in our infrastructure and focusing on efforts to earn an appropriate rate of return on prudent investments also in 2010 we continued to bring new water solutions to challenged water and wastewater systems by acquiring several smaller systems in pennsylvania indiana and missouri as part of our strategic review of our business activities the company ended the year with an agreement to acquire 11 water and 59 wastewater systems in missouri leveraging the strength of our largescale operations in that state also in a separate agreement we agreed to sell our smaller regulated operations located in texas these transactions are expected to be finalized during 2011 

2010 financial results 

our results for the year ended december 31 2010 demonstrated significant progress in difficult and challenging economic and regulatory environments we continued to increase our net income while making significant capital investment in our infrastructure and implementing operational efficiency improvements necessary to offset increases in production and employee benefit costs in 2010 we generated 27107 million in total operating revenue and 7481 million in operating income compared to total operating revenue of 24407 million and 1736 million in operating income in 2009 which reflected a 4500 million impairment charge 

  

for the yearended december 31 2010 we reported net income of 2678 million as compared to a net loss of 2331 million for the year ended december 31 2009 results in 2009 were affected by the impairment charge referenced above basic and diluted earnings per average common share were 153 for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to a basic and diluted loss per average common share of 139 for the year ended december 31 2009 in addition we generated increased cash flow from operations during 2010 of 7749 million compared to 5962 million in 2009 

for the year ended december 31 2010 our regulated businesses our largest operating segment generated 24242 million in operating revenue representing 894 of our consolidated operating revenue compared to 22073 in operating revenues representing 904 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2009 this increase of 98 in operating revenues when compared to 2009 was primarily driven by rate increases as well as increased sales volume in all customer classes in 2010 additionally for the year ended december 31 2010 our marketbased operations generated 3118 million in operating revenue compared to 2577 million in operating revenues in 2009 the increase in the marketbased operations’ revenues is mainly attributable to increased revenues associated with our entry into the industrial om market through an acquisition in december of 2009 hereafter referred to as the “contract operations’ acquisition” as well as additional revenues associated with our military contracts 

see “results of operations” below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations as well as our business segments 

capital investments 

we invested approximately 766 million and 785 million in companyfunded capital improvements in 2010 and 2009 respectively these capital investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations renew aging treatment and network assets provide capacity for new growth and enhance system reliability security and quality of service the need for continuous investment presents a challenge due to the potential for regulatory lag or the delay in recovering our operating expenses and earning an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital in conjunction with our capital program management continued its focus on reducing regulatory lag during 2010 

one of our major accomplishments in 2010 was obtaining regulatory approval and rate recognition of the newly constructed 164 million water treatment plant in kentucky which was placed in service during september 2010 

for 2011 and the foreseeable future we anticipate spending between 800 million and 1 billion yearly on companyfunded capital investment depending upon the timing of major capital projects 

continued efforts to earn an appropriate rate of return 

in 2010 we received authorizations for additional annualized revenues from general rate cases including staged increases of 2012 million as of december 31 2010 we are awaiting final orders in six other states including virginia and hawaii where interim rate increases have been put into effect requesting additional annualized revenues of 947 million there is no assurance that all or any portion thereof of any requested increases will be granted 

also in 2010 we were granted 183 million in additional annualized revenues assuming constant sales volumes from infrastructure charges in several of our states additionally on february 25 2010 our new jersey subsidiary filed a petion with the board of public utilities “board” for approval to recover rates through a surcharge of approximately 33 million on an annual basis for an increase in purchased water and sewer treatment costs on august 4 2010 the board authorized njawc to recover in rates a surcharge of approximately 31 million on an annual basis for purchased water and sewer treatment costs 

  

in january 2011 additional annualized revenue of 55 million and 17 million resulting from infrastructure charges in our pennsylvania and illinois subsidiaries respectively became effective 

2011 and beyond 

our strategy for the future will continue to focus on earning an appropriate rate of return on our investments promoting constructive regulatory frameworks expanding the regulated businesses segment through focused acquisitions and pursuing “regulatedlike” opportunities in our marketbased operations we will also continue to modernize our infrastructure and focus on operational efficiencies 

in particular for 2011 we will focus on the execution of the portfolio optimization initiative which includes the acquisition of 11 regulated water systems and 59 wastewater systems in missouri the transaction which requires approval by the missouri public service commission expands our presence in the state of missouri we will also be focused on the divestiture of our arizona new mexico and texas regulated subsidiaries by late 2011 or early 2012 also in 2011 we will concentrate on resolving rate cases outstanding on december 31 2010 and file additional rate cases where necessary and we will initiate state specific efforts to address declining usage and continued implementation or improvement of infrastructure surcharge mechanisms 

in 2011 we expect although we cannot predict with any certainty that we will continue to be challenged by the economic environment as well as declining residential water usage per customer while financial markets have been relatively stable the housing market is weak industrial production remains below prerecession levels and unemployment rates are still high even though usage volumes for water increased in 2010 compared to 2009 the demand for water has been lower than expected and remains lower than the 2008 usage levels in addition increased water conservation including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers combined with declining household sizes in the united states have contributed to a trend of declining water usage per residential customer all of the states served by our regulated businesses have experienced a declining trend in water usage per residential customer with the rate decline in the various states ranging between 05 and 2 annually over the last 10 years because the characteristics of residential water use are driven by many factors including socioeconomic and other demographic characteristics of our service areas climate seasonal weather patterns and water rates these declining trends vary by state and service area and change over time we do not believe that the trend in any particular state or region will have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon operating revenues generated from rates we charge to our customers for the volume of water they use declining usage due to conservation or the economic environment contribute to regulatory lag and will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure appropriate regulatory treatment to offset the usage decline 

also in 2011 we expect to continue to improve our operating efficiency ratio which we define as operation and maintenance expense divided by operating revenues adjusted for purchased water increase our earned regulated return and expand our marketbased operations with a focus on the homeowners services group military contract operations and municipal contract operations only where the business model provides for value creation for both american water and the municipality 

we are committed to operating our business responsibly and managing our operating and capital costs in a manner that serves our customers and produces value for our shareholders we are committed to an ongoing strategy to make ourselves more effective efficient and innovative 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated businesses and marketbased operations for the periods indicated without giving effect to intersegment eliminations 

 

  

   

our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide services to residential commercial and industrial customers this business is subject to state regulation and our results of operations are impacted significantly by rates authorized by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate the table below details additional annualized revenues including step increases and assuming a constant volume resulting from rate authorizations which were granted in 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

  

      the effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2010 were october 1 2010 july 1 2010 april 23 2010 and may 3 2010 in kentucky missouri illinois and indiana respectively rate increases granted in 2010 for pennsylvania new jeresey and arizona were not effective until january 1 2011 the effective date for the 2009 pennsylvania rate increase was november 7 2009 the effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2008 were december 8 2008 november 28 2008 and august 8 2008 in new jersey missouri and illinois respectively 

  

as previously noted an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs such as a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure the following table details additional annualized revenue authorized through infrastructure surcharge mechanisms which were granted in 2010 as these surcharges are typically rolled into the new base rates and therefore are reset to zero when new base rates are effective certain of these charges may also be reflected in the total general rate case amounts awarded in the table above if the order date was following the infrastructure surcharge filing date 

 

 comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 

operating revenues our operating revenues increased by 2700 million or 111 to 27107 million for 2010 from 24407 million for 2009 regulated businesses’ revenues increased by 2169 million or 98 for 2010 compared to 2009 the marketbased operations’ revenues for 2010 increased by 541 million or 210 from 2009 

the increase in the regulated businesses’ revenues was primarily attributable to rate increases and increased consumption the increase in our marketbased operations was primarily attributable to higher revenues in our contract operations group due to additional revenues from the contract operations’ acquisition increased military contract revenues mainly attributable to incremental contract work awarded to us in 2010 the full year effect of our two newest military contracts announced in 2009 and increased revenues in our homeowner services group mainly as a result of increased product penetration within its existing customer base these increases were partially offset by lower om and design and build contract revenues 

  

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and water sales volume by customer class 

 

 water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2010 increased 1245 million or 99 from 2009 primarily due to rate increases and a slight increase in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers increased by 15 billion gallons or 07 from 2009 we attribute this increase to warmer and drier weather in the midatlantic region of the united states primarily in the third quarter in 2010 partially offset by wetter weather in parts of the midwest region of the united states 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2010 increased by 438 million or 102 mainly due to rate increases in addition to an increase in sales volume compared to 2009 the volume of water sold to commercial customers increased by 26 billion gallons or 31 from 2009 we believe this increase is due to the combination of the aforementioned weather conditions and improved economic environment in certain states in which we operate 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers for 2010 increased 128 million or 128 from 2009 mainly due to rate increases and an increase in sales volumes the volume of water sold to industrial customers increased 43 billion gallons or 119 from 2009 we believe that this increase is due to an improved economic environment in certain states in which we operate 

water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 246 million or 91 from 2009 mainly due to rate increases revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 1212 million for 2010 an increase of 80 million from 2009 revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2010 totaled 1754 million an increase of 166 million from 2009 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 12 states revenues from these services for 2010 increased by 49 million or 55 from 2009 the increase was primarily attributable to increases in rates charged to customers in a number of our operating companies 

other revenues —other revenues include such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items for 2010 other revenues increased by 47 million mainly due to an increase in work for a managed contract as well as increased rental revenues compared to the same period in the prior year 

  

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 1058 million or 82 for 2010 compared to 2009 in 2009 and 2008 the amortization associated with the regulatory asset and regulatory liability for cost of removal had been classified as a component of maintenance expense within the operations and maintenance expense category of the company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss beginning with the 2010 yearend consolidated financial statements the company is presenting the amortization of removal costs net of salvage value within the depreciation and amortization expense of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss based on the manner in which the company evaluates its results and consistent with our peers the amortization associated with removal costs is included in depreciation and amortization the 2009 and 2008 amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2010 presentation 

operation and maintenance expenses for 2010 and 2009 by major expense category were as follows 

 

 production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal increased by 234 million or 77 for 2010 compared to 2009 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 the increase in our fuel and power costs was driven by higher costs in our regulated business of 41 million primarily due to increased production volumes and higher cost in our marketbased operations of 31 million most of which is attributable to our contract operations’ acquisition the increase in purchased water is primarily associated with our regulated businesses and is attributable to higher costs incurred by our suppliers that are passed on to us the majority of this purchased water increase is in states that permit us to passthrough this increase to our customers without the need for of a full rate proceeding the decrease in chemical costs is primarily attributable to lower chemical costs in our regulated businesses as a result of favorable contract pricing in addition to favorable water quality due to reduced rainfall in several of our operating subsidiaries waste disposal costs increased primarily due to disposal costs attributable to the contract operations’ acquisition which accounted for 30 million of the increase additionally 19 million of the increase is related to the recognition of previously deferred costs allowed by a cost recovery mechanism in one of our operating companies as well as increases in sludge removal costs in one of our regulated operating companies 

  

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and pension expense increased 631 million or 117 for 2010 compared to 2009 these employeerelated costs represented 434 and 421 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2010 and 2009 respectively and include the categories shown in the following table 

 

 a driver of the increase in salaries and wages and other benefits was the addition of employees as a result of the contract operations’ acquisition totaling 159 million and 21 million respectively the remainder of the increases in salaries and wages was due to wage increases higher incentive compensation and severance expenses as well as increased overtime costs of 53 million in certain of our regulated operating companies pension expense increased for the year ended december 31 2010 due to increased pension contributions by certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on employee retirement income security act of 1974 “erisa” minimum funding requirements this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of actuarial losses attributable to higher than expected returns on plan assets in 2009 group insurance increased due to the deferral of 27 million of costs in 2009 as part of our pennsylvania subsidiary’s rate order and 12 million of incremental costs as the result of the contract operations’ acquisition the remainder of the cost increase is attributable to the rising cost of health care 

operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation legal and other professional services as well as information systems and other office equipment rental charges for 2010 these costs increased by 58 million or 23 compared to 2009 

 

 the increase in contracted services is attributable to increased construction activity in the contract operations group related to military contracts of approximately 86 million partially offset by lower temporary labor expenses due to the filling of vacant positions and a reduction in our legal and accounting expenses the increase in office supplies and services is primarily the result of the contract operations’ acquisition while the increase in transportation costs was due to higher gasoline prices during 2010 compared to 2009 the decrease in the “other” category is mainly attributable to the establishment of a regulatory asset for a 35 million payment previously expensed by our california operating company to the california department of fish and game “cdfg” on behalf of noaa in the third quarter of 2010 this reversal was the result of an advice letter issued by the california public utility commission which now allows for rate recovery of such payment also contributing to the reduction were lower costs attributable to the fact that the 2009 amount included an 

  

adjustment of 34 million attributable to previously capitalized costs and 19 million of divestiture related costs these reductions were offset by a 50 million contribution to the american water charitable foundation a 501c3 organization that was established in december 2010 to encourage and support employee volunteerism and community giving 

maintenance materials and services which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance increased 229 million or by 252 for 2010 compared to 2009 

 

 the regulated businesses’ maintenance materials and service costs increased by 133 million in 2010 which was mainly attributable to higher levels of tank painting meter testing pump tank and well maintenance and paving costs throughout our regulated subsidiaries these increases were partially offset by the inclusion of additional costs incurred by our arizona subsidiary attributable to a backbilling by the city of glendale arizona for our pro rata share of sewer line maintenance amounting to 10 million in 2009 in our marketbased operations these expenses increased 96 million primarily due to higher maintenance expenses of 59 million in the contract operations group including increased cost associated with the contract operations’ acquisition as well as higher costs related to military contracts resulting from incremental construction projects and growth mainly related to the fort meade and fort belvoir locations 

customer billing and accounting expenses decreased by 06 million or 12 for 2010 compared to 2009 

 

 the decrease in the uncollectible accounts expense was the result of improved collection in our receivables in excess of 120 days in our regulated businesses which had a favorable impact of 24 million on our uncollectible account expense partially offset by increased reserves due to higher accounts receivable balances as a result of increased revenues 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs decreased by 89 million or 169 for 2010 compared to 2009 

 

   

the decrease in insurance expense is primarily due to the positive resolution of prior years’ claims in 2010 compared to 2009 regulatory expenses were higher in 2009 due to the rate case expenses of 35 million that could not be recovered by our california subsidiary 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 195 million or 58 for 2010 compared to 2009 this increase was due to our continued investment in our infrastructure and capital expenditures many of which were placed into service in 2010 by our regulated businesses this increase was partially offset by the 24 million writeoff of certain software costs in 2009 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by 194 million or 97 in 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 this increase was due to higher gross receipts taxes of 67 million primarily in our new jersey regulated subsidiary higher property taxes of 59 million throughout our regulated operations higher payroll taxes of 33 million as a result of our increased wages and salaries for the year december 31 2010 and higher capital stock taxes of 17 million 

impairment charge no impairment charge was recorded in 2010 for the twelve months ended december 31 2009 we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill for our regulated businesses in the amount of 4482 million and in our marketbased operations of 18 million the 2009 impairment charge which was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 was primarily related to the high degree of stock market volatility experienced and as of march 31 2009 the sustained period for which the company’s market price was below its carrying value 

other income expenses interest expense net of interest income which is the primary component of our other income expenses increased by 185 million or 62 for 2010 compared to 2009 the increase is primarily due to the refinancing of shortterm debt with longterm debt during 2009 as well as increased borrowing associated with capital expenditures as a result of the volatile market conditions in 2008 the company utilized its shortterm debt credit facilities to fund our capital projects and other operating needs which resulted in higher shortterm borrowings in the first half of 2009 our short term borrowings were steadily reduced during 2009 through a significant number of longterm debt refinancings with fixed interest rates the increase in fixed rate longterm debt resulted in higher interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 also in addition to the increase in interest expense allowance for funds used during construction “afudc” decreased by 24 million for 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 as a result of assets being placed into service primarily in our arizona kentucky and indiana regulated subsidiaries furthermore other income increased due to higher joint venture income and changes in market value of companyheld deferred compensation other items affecting other income expense include the release of the remaining balance of a loss reserve of 13 million as a result of the resolution of outstanding issues and uncertainties that occurred during 2010 as well as the recognition of funds received related to the mbte legal settlement for 19 million resulting from the outcome of a subsidiary’s rate order 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 602 million or 496 to 1816 million for 2010 from 1214 million in 2009 the effective tax rates in 2010 and 2009 were 404 and 1087 respectively the 2009 effective tax rate reflects the tax effects of the 2009 goodwill impairment charge as the company considers this charge as infrequently occurring or unusual in addition to the tax benefits associated with the goodwill impairment charge 2009 also included tax benefits attributable to the impact of tax law changes as well as other discrete items the company’s annual effective tax rate was 409 and 393 for 2010 and 2009 respectively excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge and various other discrete items totaling 21 million in 2010 and 31 million in 2009 

net income loss net income for 2010 was 2678 million compared to a net loss of 2331 million for 2009 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

  

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

operating revenues our operating revenues increased by 1038 million or 44 to 24407 million for 2009 from 23369 million for 2008 regulated businesses’ revenues increased by 1246 million or 60 for 2009 compared to 2008 the marketbased operations’ revenues for 2009 decreased by 145 million or 53 from 2008 

the increase in the regulated businesses’ revenues was primarily due to incremental revenues of 1873 million resulting from rate increases obtained through general rate cases as well as higher revenues resulting from surcharges and balancing accounts of 182 million additional revenues of 49 million were attributable to water and wastewater acquisitions most of which were in the later half of 2008 and fire service revenues increased by 53 million these increases were offset by a 936 million decrease in revenues related to lower customer consumption in a number of our operating companies mainly as a result of wet and cool weather in the midatlantic and midwestern regions of the united states as well as the downturn in the economy and conservation 

our marketbased operations’ operating revenues decreased by 145 million or 53 to 2577 million in 2009 from 2722 million for 2008 the net decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues in our contract operations group and in our applied water management group partially offset by increased revenues in our homeowner services group the decrease in contract operations group revenues was primarily attributable to lower revenues associated with design and build contracts offset by increased military construction and om project revenues revenues of the applied water management group which was combined into the contract operations group during 2010 were lower than the prior year primarily due to the disposal of a pumping and hauling business in late 2008 and a decline in design and build activity resulting from the downturn in new home construction the increase from our homeowner services group represented increased product penetration within its existing customer base and the addition of new mexico to our list of states where we offer our services 

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and water sales volume by customer class 

 

 water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2009 increased 648 million or 54 from 2008 primarily due to rate increases offset by a decrease in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers decreased by 104 billion gallons or 49 from 2008 we attribute this decrease to wetter and cooler weather conditions in a number of states in which we operate water conservation 

  

in general as well as the impact of california’s new conservation tariffs which were effective in 2009 and its severe water shortage due to legal restrictions imposed upon withdrawals from the sacramento delta and a longterm drought also contributed to the reduction 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2009 increased by 228 million or 56 mainly due to rate increases offset by decreases in sales volume compared to 2008 the volume of water sold to commercial customers decreased by 44 billion gallons or 49 from 2008 we attribute this decrease to the weather conditions as well as the downturn in the economy 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers for 2009 decreased 21 million or 20 from 2008 mainly due to decreased sales volume offset by rate increases the volume of water sold to industrial customers decreased 58 billion gallons or 138 from 2008 we attribute the decrease in the sales volumes to the thencurrent economic environment as customers reduced demand due to slowdown in their production process or the shutdown of production altogether in the case of some bankruptcies 

water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 163 million or 64 from 2008 mainly due to rate increases revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 1132 million for 2009 an increase of 88 million from 2008 revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2009 totaled 1588 million an increase of 75 million from 2008 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 12 states revenues from these services for 2009 increased by 98 million or 122 from 2008 the increase was attributable to increases in rates charged to customers in a number of our operating companies as well as higher revenues as a result of acquisitions of wastewater systems in pennsylvania and west virginia in the last six months of 2008 

other revenues —other revenues include such items as reconnection charges initial application service fees rental revenues revenue collection services for others and similar items these revenues increased by 35 million or 119 mainly due to an increase in work for a managed contract in 2009 compared to 2008 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 211 million or 17 for 2009 compared to 2008 

operation and maintenance expenses for 2009 and 2008 by major expense category were as follows 

 

   

production costs increased by 147 million or 51 for 2009 compared to 2008 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 the decrease in fuel and power costs was primarily due to lower fuel prices in addition to the decreased water sales volumes partially offset by increased electric rates purchased water increased due to rate increases by our suppliers the increase in chemical costs was due to rising prices for those commodities compared to the same period in the prior year 

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and pension expense increased 347 million or 69 for 2009 compared to 2008 these employeerelated costs represented 421 and 401 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

 salaries and wages increased 58 million and 38 million in our regulated and marketbased operations respectively these increases primarily resulted from increased employee headcount as a result of enhancing customer service and merit wage rate increases partially offset by 43 million of wages related to job reclassification of certain hourly employees for services performed which was recorded in 2008 in addition to less expense for overtime worked in 2009 the increase in pension expense was primarily due to an increase in our regulated businesses’ pension expense of 117 million or 258 for 2009 over 2008 this increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses attributable to lower than expected returns on plan assets in 2008 as a result of the decline in the economic environment these market conditions were also the primary reason for the increase in costs for the other post employment benefits which are included in the group insurance amounts above medical benefit expenses for employees which are included in group insurance increased due to an increase in the number of employees and the rising cost of health care other benefits increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages which in turn resulted in increased company contribution to the 401k and defined contribution plans also other benefit expenses increased due to the benefit expense related to the new employee stock purchase plan 

  

operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation legal and other professional services as well as information systems and other office equipment rental charges for 2009 these costs decreased by 347 million or 123 compared to 2008 

 

 contracted services decreased in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in contracted services in our marketbased operations of 191 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of a decreased level of activity for our design build and operate project in fillmore california additionally consulting fees associated with our remediation efforts to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 decreased 94 million the decrease in transportation costs is due to lower gasoline prices on average in 2009 as compared to 2008 other operating supplies and services decreased due to lower divestiture and initial public offering “ipo” related costs these costs totaled 19 million in 2009 compared to 124 million in 2008 offsetting these decreases were 2009 condemnation costs of 24 million the establishment of reserves for assets not recoverable at this time associated with the california rate case of 10 million an increase in business development costs of 10 million and 15 million of profits included in our marketbased operations’ expenses in 2008 as a result of the finalization and acceptance by the third party related to construction projects also included was an adjustment of 34 million attributable to previously capitalized costs 

maintenance materials and services which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance decreased 39 million or by 42 for 2009 compared to 2008 

 

 our regulated businesses’ maintenance materials and service costs decreased 06 million in 2009 the 2008 costs included 26 million associated with a program in illinois to maintain valves and fire hydrants offsetting these decreases were additional costs incurred by our arizona subsidiary attributable to a back billing by the city of glendale arizona for our pro rata share of sewer line maintenance amounting to 10 million as well as increased tank painting costs of 07 million in one of our operating subsidiaries the marketbased operations’ maintenance and services expenses decreased by 33 million mainly due to decreased homeowner services maintenance services and supplies due to favorable claims experience 

  

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 38 million or 85 for 2009 compared to 2008 

 

 the increase was primarily the result of higher uncollectible accounts expense in our regulated businesses of 27 million due to an unusually low balance in 2008 as the result of a collection effort in the first quarter of 2008 to collect previously written off accounts our overall 2009 writeoff percentages and specific provisions for certain receivables including a number of commercial and industrial customers that have filed for bankruptcy increased in 2009 due the uncertainty of collectability which we believe was attributable to the thencurrent economic environment our marketbased operations’ uncollectible expense decreased 16 million primarily as a result of the collection of accounts previously writtenoff the increase in the other category is mainly due to an increase in collection fees in our regulated businesses 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 66 million or 144 for 2009 compared to 2008 

 

 insurance expense increased due to less favorable claims experience in 2009 compared to 2008 in addition to higher general liability and property insurance premiums regulatory expenses increased in 2009 primarily as a result of a 35 million writeoff of rate case expenses as well as 13 million of ongoing rate case expenses associated with our california subsidiary costs incurred in connection with the rate case appeal in our tennessee subsidiary as well as increased amortization of costs related to final rate orders received in several states partially offsetting these increases were decreases associated with the writeoff of deferred rate case expenses in tennessee illinois and ohio in 2008 amounting to 32 million 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 224 million or 72 for 2009 compared to 2008 this increase was primarily due to additional assets placed in service mainly in our regulated businesses over the last year and a 24 million writeoff of certain software costs 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items remained relatively unchanged increasing by only 01 million or 01 in 2009 compared to 2008 

impairment charge the impairment charge was 4500 million for 2009 compared to 7500 million for 2008 the 2009 amount recorded included an impairment charge to goodwill of our regulated businesses in the amount of 4482 million and our marketbased operations of 18 million the 2009 impairment charge which was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 was primarily related to the high degree of stock market volatility experienced and as of march 31 2009 the sustained period for which the company’s market price was below its 

  

carrying value the 2008 impairment charge was primarily due to the market price of the company’s common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than what was anticipated during our 2007 annual impairment test also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company’s debt due to increased interest rates see “factors affecting our results of operations—goodwill impairment” 

other income expenses interest expense net of interest income the primary component of our other income expenses increased by 114 million or 40 for 2009 compared to 2008 the increase is primarily due to increased borrowings associated with capital expenditures in addition afudc decreased by 40 million in 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of certain key projects being placed inservice other items contributing to the change include lower miscellaneous income for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of the change in market value of investments held for certain employees’ elected deferred compensation 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 96 million or 86 to 1214 million for 2009 from 1118 million for 2008 the effective tax rates of 1087 and 248 for 2009 and 2008 respectively reflect the tax effects of the goodwill impairment charges as discrete items as the company considers these charges as infrequently occurring or unusual in addition to the tax benefits associated with the goodwill impairment charges 2009 included tax benefits attributable to the impact of tax law changes as well as other discrete items the company’s annual effective tax rate was 393  and 398  for 2009 and 2008 respectively excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charges and the various other discrete items 

net loss the net loss for 2009 was 2331 million compared to a net loss of 5624 million for 2008 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures our business is very capital intensive and requires significant capital resources a portion of these capital resources is provided by internally generated cash flows from operations when necessary we obtain additional funds from external sources in the debt and equity capital markets and through bank borrowings our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets if these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms we have access to revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of 8500 million we rely on these revolving credit facilities and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to back our commercial paper program disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt and equity securities in the capital markets see “—credit facilities and shortterm debt” 

in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we primarily issue commercial paper which is backed by awcc’s revolving credit facilities awcc had 27 million of outstanding borrowings and 368 million of outstanding letters of credit under its credit facilities as of december 31 2010 as of december 31 2010 awcc had 8105 million available under our credit facilities that we can use to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and back our 1753 million outstanding commercial paper we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated operating companies receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers 

  

begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines 

we use our capital resources including cash to i fund capital requirements including construction expenditures ii pay off maturing debt iii pay dividends iv fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and v invest in new and existing ventures we spend a significant amount of cash on construction projects that we expect to have a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag see “business—regulation—economic regulation” we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and cash flows from operations since we continue to make investments equal to or greater than our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are weighted toward the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation infrastructure investment inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining per customer usage of water and weather and seasonality 

cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements make our dividend payments and fund a portion of our capital expenditures requirements we will seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed there can be no assurance that we will be able to access such markets successfully on favorable terms or at all operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulated environments or changes in our customers’ economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated 

 

  

   

 the increase in cash flows from operations during 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily due to an increase in revenues and the change in working capital 

the increase in cash flows from operations during 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to increased revenues offset by changes in working capital mainly driven by changes in taxes receivable and taxes accrued the change in taxes is primarily due to the fact that a 350 million tax refund including interest was received in december 2008 no similar amount was received at the end of 2009 the increase in the 2009 pension contributions was the result of the company’s 2008 unfunded status of its pension plan which increased significantly primarily due to lower than expected 2008 asset returns 

the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1668 million in 2011 of which 210 million was already made in january 2011 in addition we currently estimate that contributions will amount to 1550 million in 2012 1276 million in 2013 1264 million in 2014 and 1073 million in 2015 actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows for the periods indicated 

 

  

 cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due the change in “other investing activities” in 2010 which resulted from the change in the net restricted funds released attributable primarily to the drawdown of the restricted funds by our kentucky and pennsylvania regulated operating companies this increase was partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures as a result of delayed construction in the first quarter of 2010 due to the severe weather conditions in certain states in which we operate as well as a higher spending in 2009 on water treatment plant expenditures as a number of facilities were under construction in 2009 

cash flows used in investing activities decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 mainly due to a decrease in capital expenditures which was primarily attributable to our decision as a result of the 2008 credit market disruptions to decrease in 2009 our investment in our regulated utility plant projects 

in 2011 we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 800 million and 1 billion we intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base while working with regulators in the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment 

  

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

during 2010 we continued to move forward with bt to enhance processes and upgrade antiquated legacy systems in order to generate efficiencies and provide more cost effective service to our customers in 2010 we completed our evaluation of appropriate software solutions and selected our software vendor as well as our system integrator during the fourth quarter of 2010 we began working with the system integrator to analyze our current processes and to design a blueprint for business processes and new systems that will enable business transformation this work will continue through the first quarter of 2011 during the remainder of 2011 we will begin the detailed design and build of the enterprise resource planning “erp” application we expect to have all three enterprisewide systems or applications—the erp a new customer information system and an enterprise asset management system—implemented by the end of 2014 

current estimates indicate that bt expenditures could total as much as 280 million through december 31 2010 we have spent 345 million on the project expenditures associated with bt are included in the estimated capital investment spending of 800 million to 1 billion capital investment spending outlined above as with any other initiative of this magnitude there are risks that could result in increased costs any technical difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative such as implementing a successful change management process may result in delays which in turn may increase the costs of the project and also delay and perhaps reduce any cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the initiative when we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure while we believe such expenditures can be recovered through regulated rates we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely rate recovery of these increased costs associated with this transformation project any such delays or difficulties encountered with such recovery may have a material and adverse impact on our business customer relationships and financial results we believe that the goals of bt—increasing our operating efficiency and effectiveness and controlling the costs associated with the operation of our business—are important to providing the quality service to our customers and communities we serve 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures 

 

 capital expenditures during the periods noted above were related to the renewal of supply and treatment assets construction of new water mains and customer service lines as well as rehabilitation of existing water mains and hydrants 

  

capital expenditures for 2010 decreased by 196 million or 25 from 7853 million in 2009 as a result of delayed construction due to severe weather conditions in the first quarter of 2010 in certain states in which we operate and increased water treatment facility expenditures in 2009 construction expenditures for 2009 decreased by 2235 million or 222 over 2008 as a result of our 2009 decision to address the credit market disruptions 

on april 25 2008 the kentucky public service commission approved kentuckyamerican water company’s application for a certificate of convenience and necessity to construct a 200 million gallon per day treatment plant on the kentucky river and a 306 mile pipeline to meet central kentucky’s water supply deficit the kentucky project with total construction costs of 164 million was placed in service in september 2010 

an integral aspect of our strategy is to seek growth through tuckins by helping commissions with troubled water systems as well as other acquisitions that are complementary to our existing business and support the continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt or equity offerings 

the following provides a summary of the major acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities in the years indicated 

2010 

 

 2009 

 

 2008 

 

  

 our investing activities could require considerable capital resources which we have generated through operations and attained through financing activities we can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans the company’s announced sale of its arizona and new mexico subsidiaries will have a favorable impact on cash flows from investing activities when the deal is closed as the proceeds from such sale are expected to be approximately 470 million 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities primarily focused on funding construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt mainly through awcc we access capital markets on a regular basis subject to market conditions as a result of the anticipated proceeds from the divestiture of our arizona and new mexico regulated businesses we expect to fund our 2011 cash requirements with shortterm debt additionally because of this transaction we do not anticipate the need for an equity offering in 2011 in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds this amounted to 70 million 212 million and 31 million for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

on may 1 2009 we and awcc filed a universal shelf registration statement that enabled us to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities including common stock preferred stock and debt securities all subject to market demand and ratings status during 2010 no common stock or preferred stock offerings were made pursuant to this filling 

pursuant to a public offering in june 2009 the company completed the sale of 145 million shares of common stock at 1725 per share the proceeds from the offering net of underwriters’ discounts and expenses payable by the company were 2423 million the proceeds from the offering were used to repay shortterm debt at the same time rwe completed a partial divestiture of its investment in the company through the sale of 115 million shares also at a price of 1725 rwe granted the underwriters a 30day option to purchase up to an additional 39 million shares of the company’s stock at a price of 1725 the underwriters exercised their option and purchased 39 million shares to cover overallotments the company did not receive any proceeds from the rwe sale of the company’s shares prior to the sale of these shares by rwe and the company rwe owned approximately 60 of the company’s common shares after the sales of shares and exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option rwe owned approximately 47 of the company’s shares

as of december 31 2008 the company had issued through its subsidiaries 1203 million of variable rate demand bonds which were periodically remarketed during the months of january and february 2009 awcc purchased these variable rate demand bonds because no investors were willing to purchase the bonds at acceptable market rates and held such bonds in treasury as a result of these repurchases in early 2009 and prior to the release of our 2008 10k the debt was reflected in current portion of longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 on may 21 2009 awcc remarketed 529 million of these variable rate demand notes as fixed rate tax exempt water facility revenue bonds with interest rates ranging from 600 to 675 the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay shortterm debt also on may 21 2009 awcc remarketed 319 million of the variable rate notes held in the company’s treasury and subsequently remarketed 233 million as fixed rate tax exempt water facility revenue bonds in the third quarter of 2009 the residual 86 million remains variable rate on the open market during the third quarter 2009 awcc successfully remarketed 249 million of the variable rate demand notes as fixed rate tax exempt water facility revenue bonds with an interest rate of 625 the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay shortterm debt the remaining 106 million was held in the company’s treasury at december 31 2009 they were subsequently remarketed as fixed rates bonds with a coupon rate of 525 and a maturity date of 2028 on july 27 2010

credit facilities and shortterm debt 

the components of shortterm debt were as follows 

 

 awcc our finance subsidiary has entered into a 100 million committed revolving line of credit with pnc bank na which was scheduled to terminate on december 31 2010 on december 22 2010 this line of credit was extended for an additional year and will terminate on december 31 2011 unless extended this line is used primarily for shortterm working capital needs interest rates on advances under this line of credit are based on the one month libor on the outstanding debt plus 175 basis points for 2010 and 2011 in addition there is a fee of 25 basis points charged quarterly on the portion of the commitment that is undrawn as of december 31 2010 the outstanding borrowing against this credit line was 27 million there were no outstanding borrowings under this revolving line of credit at december 31 2009 if this line of credit were not extended beyond its current maturity date of december 31 2011 awcc would continue to have access to its 8400 million unsecured revolving credit facility described below 

  

awcc has entered into an 8400 million senior unsecured credit facility syndicated among the following group of 11 banks with jpmorgan chase bank na acting as administrative agent 

 

 this revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire on september 15 2012 is principally used to support the commercial paper program at awcc and to provide up to 1500 million in letters of credit a majority of the banks agreed to further extend 6850 million of commitments under this revolving credit facility to september 15 2013 if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances the company may request the other lenders to assume the defaulting lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment however the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender’s commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to replace a defaulting lender awcc had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities and 364 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 22 2011 also as of february 22 2011 awcc had 1947 million of commercial paper outstanding 

on december 31 2010 and 2009 awcc had the following sublimits and available capacity under the revolving credit facility and indicated amounts of outstanding commercial paper 

 

 interest rates on advances under the revolving credit facility are based on either prime or libor plus an applicable margin based upon our credit ratings as well as total outstanding amounts under the agreement at the time of the borrowing the maximum libor margin is 55 basis points 

the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 was approximately 042 and 082 respectively 

  

capital structure 

the following table indicates the percentage of our capitalization represented by the components of our capital structure as of december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 the changes to our capital resource mix during 2008 were accomplished through the various financing activities noted above in “cash from financing activities” the capital structure at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 more closely reflects our expected future capital structure 

as a condition to some puc approvals of the rwe divestiture we agreed to maintain a capital structure with a minimum of 45 common equity at the time of the consummation of our initial public offering on april 28 2008 as a result of the impairment charge recorded for the three months ended march 31 2008 our capital structure did not meet this minimum requirement and we received a cash equity contribution from rwe of 2450 million on may 1 2008 this cash was used to repay 2434 million of shortterm debt following the initial public offering rwe was not obligated to make any additional capital contributions 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue debt or access our revolving credit lines we were in compliance with our covenants as of december 31 2010 however our california and ohio subsidiaries did not meet the interest coverage test of at least 15x for the twelve months ended december 31 2010 under the mortgage indenture and therefore they would be unable to issue new secured debt see “risk factors—risks related to our industry and business—our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger repayment obligations” longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things limit the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets subject to certain exceptions 

the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2010 our ratio was 058 and therefore we were in compliance with the ratio 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets depends on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets we primarily access the capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we also issue debt at our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities to lower our overall cost of debt the following table shows the company’s securities ratings as of december 31 2010 

 

   

on january 28 2011  standard  poor’s ratings services which we refer to as sp reaffirmed its “bbb” corporate credit rating on awcc and american water and awcc’s “a2” shortterm rating sp’s rating outlook for both american water and awcc is stable 

on november 19 2010 moody’s investors service which we refer to as moody’s affirmed its “baa2” corporate credit rating on awcc and american water and affirmed awcc’s “p2” shortterm rating the rating outlook for both american water and awcc is stable 

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flow is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facilities 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy fuels and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance depending on the company’s net position with a counterparty the demand could be for the posting of collateral in the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided the obligation to supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the company’s situation at the time of the demand if we can reasonably claim that we are willing and financially able to perform our obligations it may be possible to argue successfully that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future payments should be sufficient we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends rather than retaining that cash for other purposes generally our policy is to distribute 50 to 70 of our net income annually we expect that dividends will be paid quarterly to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock will not be cumulative only declared dividends will be paid 

during 2010 2009 and 2008 we paid 1503 million 1373 million and 641 million in dividends respectively for 2010 we paid a dividend of 022 per share on december 1 2010 and september 1 2010 and 021 per share on june 1 2010 and march 1 2010 for 2009 we paid a dividend of 021 per share on december 1 2009 and september 1 2009 and 020 per share on june 1 2009 and march 2 2009 for 2008 we paid a dividend of 020 per share on september 2 2008 and december 1 2008 

subject to applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors we will pay cash dividends of approximately 022 per share per quarter in 2011 to be paid approximately 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter the quarterly and annual average aggregate dividend amounts for the four quarters would be 385 million and 1540 million annually the aggregate dividend amounts are based upon 1750 million shares outstanding as of december 31 2010 under delaware law our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our “surplus” which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities minus 

  

statutory capital or if there is no surplus out of our net profits for the then current andor immediately preceding fiscal year although we believe we will have sufficient net profits or surplus to pay dividends at the anticipated levels during the next four quarters our board of directors will seek periodically to assure itself of this before actually declaring any dividends in future periods our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient to allow payment of dividends and such opinions may not be forthcoming if we sought and were not able to obtain such an opinion we likely would not be able to pay dividends 

on january 28 2011 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 022 per share payable on march 1 2011 to all shareholders of record as of february 18 2011 

current credit market position 

the company believes it has sufficient liquidity should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets the company funds liquidity needs for capital investment working capital and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations public and private debt offerings commercial paper markets and credit facilities with 8500 million in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of banks the company closely monitors the financial condition of the financial institutions associated with its credit facilities 

the company expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets on favorable terms before the maturity dates of its current credit facilities and the company does not expect a significant number of its lenders to default on their commitments thereunder in addition the company can delay major capital investments or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt or equity securities at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that the subsidiary can distribute to us 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions that we believe are consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 

  

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business these financial obligations as of december 31 2010 are set forth in the table below 

 

 note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our marketbased operations are not included in the above amounts 

 

         publicprivate partnerships 

west virginiaamerican water company which we refer to as wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships wvawc constructed utility plant financed by wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to 

  

wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

wvawc leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities was approximately 1597 million at december 31 2010 

marketbased operations’ performance obligations 

our marketbased operations’ contract operations group enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2060 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenues of 20820 million at december 31 2010 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2011 and 2048 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 11970 million at december 31 2010 some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

our financial condition results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we account for these regulated operations in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements use of the authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria 1 thirdparty regulation of rates 2 costbased rates and 3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates as of december 31 2010 we had concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of the business no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as a onetime extraordinary item and continued impacts on our operating activities 

  

regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow for recovery through rates charged to customers regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred as of december 31 2010 we have recorded 10160 million of net regulatory assets within our consolidated financial statements also at december 31 2010 we had recorded 3037 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates if subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement our statement of operations and financial position could be materially affected 

goodwill 

the company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan at december 31 2010 the company’s goodwill was 12507 million the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values including goodwill on the measurement date if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

for the november 30 2010 impairment test the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques 

 

  

 the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the regulated reporting unit’s historic and forecasted cash flows the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers 

  

the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s threeyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital 

because of the unique nature small size and lack of historical earnings of most of the marketbased reporting units a market approach historically could not be reasonably applied as such the estimated fair values of the marketbased reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models for the november 30 2010 impairment test a market approach was introduced to the marketbased reporting units as the larger marketbased reporting units have begun to mature 

the company has completed its november 30 2010 annual impairment review and does not believe that the company’s goodwill balance was impaired the company’s fair value calculated in its 2010 impairment test period was greater than the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units 

however there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge 

we also made certain assumptions which we believe to be appropriate that support the fair value of our reporting units we considered in addition to the listed trading price of the company’s shares the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate as a result we concluded that the company’s fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone 

the difference between our calculated market capitalization which approximates carrying value and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulted from an estimated control premium the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling majority interest in the company in estimating the control premium management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace 

for the year ended december 31 2010 no impairment charge was recorded for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill in the amounts of 4500 million and 7500 million respectively 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market value of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a 

  

different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period unbilled utility revenues as of december 31 2010 and 2009 were 1409 million and 1303 million respectively increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and favorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue however since the majority of our customers are billed on a monthly basis total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged 

revenue from marketbased operations is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

accounting for income taxes 

the parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for united states tax purposes members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns 

certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes the company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements these deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse in addition the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences previously flowed through to customers reverse 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations the pension plans have been closed for any employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after 

  

january 1 2006 will be provided with a 525 of base pay defined contribution plan we also maintain postretirement benefit plans for eligible retirees the retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices in selecting a discount rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans a yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 532 593 and 612 at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 527 582 and 609 at december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 790 for 2010 2009 and 2008 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 760 for 2010 and 2009 and 775 for 2008 

the asset allocations for the company’s us pension plan at december 31 2010 and 2009 by asset category are as follows 

 

   

the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocations for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2010 and 2009 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held directly and through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and post retirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 782 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date while 181 of the assets are valued using other observable inputs and 37 use unobservable inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 350 for 2010 and 400 for 2009 and 2008 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 850 in 2010 gradually declining to 500 in 2017 and thereafter 

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 

 we will use a discount rate and eroa of 532 and 790 respectively for estimating our 2011 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and eroa of 527 and 760 respectively for estimating our 2011 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2010 and 2009 pension and postretirement costs were 800 million and 726 million respectively the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1668 million 1550 million 1276 million 1264 million and 1073 million in 2011 2012 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates 

  

the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

new accounting standards 

revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 

in october 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance that amends existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenuegenerating transaction where multiple deliverables exist and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables the guidance is expected to result in more multipledeliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance this guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1 2011 and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements the company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance may have on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

business combinations 

in december 2010 the fasb clarified the requirements for reporting of pro forma revenue and earnings disclosures for business combinations the accounting update specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2010 as this guidance clarifies and provides for additional disclosure requirements only the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

intangibles—goodwill 

in december 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that modifies step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts the update requires that for those reporting units an entity is required to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist the qualitative factors are consistent with existing authoritative guidance which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2010 the company does not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

fair value measurements 

in january 2010 the fasb issued authoritative guidance that requires new disclosures of i the amounts of significant transfers into and out of level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers and ii information in the reconciliation of recurring level 3 measurements those using significant unobservable inputs about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis this update also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation 

  

techniques used to measure fair value this guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the requirement to disclose information about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level 3 measurements which does not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2010 as this guidance clarifies and provides for additional disclosure requirements only the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows in addition the company does not expect the adoption of the requirement to disclose additional information in the reconciliation of level 3 measurements to have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices equity prices and interest rates we are exposed to risks from changes in interest rates as a result of our issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates we also have the ability to enter into financial derivative instruments which could include instruments such as but not limited to interest rate swaps swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure as of december 31 2010 a hypothetical increase of interest rates by 1 associated with our shortterm borrowings would result in a 18 million decrease in our pretax earnings 

in july 2010 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of 1000 million this agreement effectively converted the interest on 1000 million of outstanding 6085 fixed rate debt maturing 2017 to a variable rate of sixmonth libor plus 3422 we entered into this interest rate swap to mitigate interest cost at the parent company relating to debt that was incurred by our prior owners and was not used in any manner to finance the cash needs of our subsidiaries as the swap interest rates are fixed through april 2011 a hypothetical 1 increase in the interest rates associated with the interest swap agreement would result in a 07 million decrease on our pretax earnings for the year ended december 31 2011 this calculation holds all other variables constant and assumes only the discussed changes in interest rates 

our risks associated with price increases for chemicals electricity and other commodities are reduced through contractual arrangements and the ability to recover price increases through rates nonperformance by these commodity suppliers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

the market price of our common stock may experience fluctuations many of which are unrelated to our operating performance in particular our stock price may be affected by general market movements as well as developments specifically related to the water and wastewater industry these could include among other things interest rate movements quarterly variations or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and governmental or regulatory actions this volatility may make it difficult for us to access the capital markets in the future through additional offerings of our common stock regardless of our financial performance and such difficulty may preclude us from being able to take advantage of certain business opportunities or meet business obligations 

we are exposed to credit risk through our water wastewater and other waterrelated activities for both our regulated businesses and marketbased operations our regulated businesses serve residential commercial industrial and municipal customers while our marketbased operations engage in business activities with developers government entities and other customers our primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on 

  

contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer accounts receivable balances our credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and involve monitoring of customer exposure and the use of credit risk mitigation measures such as letters of credit or prepayment arrangements our credit portfolio is diversified with no significant customer or industry concentrations in addition our regulated businesses are generally able to recover all prudently incurred costs including uncollectible customer accounts receivable expenses and collection costs through rates 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates in addition pension and other benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields 

we are also exposed to a potential national economic recession or further deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which we operate the credit quality of our customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of our customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes in addition as a result of the downturn in the economy and heightened sensitivity of the impact of additional rate increases on certain customers there can be no assurances that regulators will grant sufficient rate authorizations therefore our ability to fully recover operating expense recover our investment and provide an appropriate return on invested capital made in our regulated businesses may be adversely impacted

in 2003 we were acquired by rwe and were no longer a publicly traded company in 2005 rwe decided to divest american water and in march 2006 they decided to affect the divestiture through the sale of shares in one or more public offerings 

on april 28 2008 rwe aqua holdings gmbh a german limited liability company and a direct whollyowned subsidiary of rwe which then was the sole owner of the company’s common stock completed a partial divestiture of its investment through an initial public offering with the sale of 632 million shares of the company’s common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008 we again became listed on the nyse under the symbol “awk” and resumed our position as the largest publicly traded water utility company in the united states as of december 31 2008 rwe owned approximately 60 of the company’s shares of common stock on june 10 2009 and august 18 2009 rwe continued to divest of its 

  

investment in our common stock through public offerings of an additional 154 million shares and 403 million shares respectively on november 24 2009 rwe completed the sale in a public offering of the remaining 411 million shares of our common stock including 37 million shares sold upon underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option as a result of the full exercise of the underwriter’s option rwe fully divested of our common stock 

regulated businesses overview 

our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial and industrial customers our subsidiaries that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by certain state commissions or other entities engaged in economic regulation hereafter referred to as “pucs” in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters we report the results of this business in our regulated businesses segment for 2009 operating revenue for our regulated businesses was 22073 million prior to intersegment eliminations accounting for 904 of total operating revenue for the same period regulated business operating revenues were 20827 million for 2008 and 19876 million for 2007 accounting for 891 and 898 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

the following charts set forth operating revenue for 2009 and customers as of december 31 2009 for the states in which our regulated businesses provide services 

 

 

nonregulated businesses overview 

we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs through our nonregulated businesses our nonregulated businesses include our 

 

   

  

  

  

 we report the results of these lines of business in our nonregulated businesses segment for 2009 operating revenue for our nonregulated businesses was 2577 million prior to intersegment eliminations accounting for 106 of total operating revenue for the same period nonregulated business operating revenues were 2722 million for 2008 and 2427 million for 2007 accounting for 116 and 110 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

our industry 

overview 

the united states water and wastewater industry has two main segments i utility which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers and ii general services which involves providing water and wastewater related services to water and wastewater utilities and other customers on a contract basis 

the utility segment includes municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions and investorowned systems the environmental protection agency “epa” estimates that governmentowned systems make up the vast majority of the united states water and wastewater utility segment accounting for approximately 84 of all united states community water systems and approximately 98 of all united states community wastewater systems investorowned water and wastewater systems account for the remainder of the united states water and wastewater community water systems growth of service providers in the regulated utility segment is achieved through acquisitions including small water and wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers that are in close geographic proximity to our regulated business operations these smaller acquisitions we refer to as “tuckins” of other water and wastewater systems and organic growth of the population served by such providers 

the utility segment is characterized by high barriers to entry including high capital spending requirements investorowned water and wastewater utilities also face regulatory approval processes in order to do business which may involve obtaining relevant operating approvals including certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations from state pucs investorowned water and wastewater systems are generally subject to economic regulation by the state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters for both investorowned and governmentowned water and wastewater utilities 

the general services segment includes engineering and consulting companies and numerous other feeforservice businesses these include the building and operating of water and wastewater utility systems system repair services lab services sale of water infrastructure and distribution products such as pipes and other specialized services the general services segment is characterized by aggressive competition and marketdriven growth and profit margins 

  

the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in constant need of modernization and facilities replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of wastewater discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization the epa estimates that approximately 335 billion of capital spending will be necessary between 2007 and 2026 to replace aging infrastructure and to comply with quality standards to ensure quality water systems across the united states in addition the epa estimates that approximately 390 billion of capital spending will be necessary over the next 20 years to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states 

the following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2007 through 2026 for united states water systems 

capital expenditures related to municipal water supply treatment and distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities are typically funded by water and wastewater rates taxes or the issuance of bonds however raising large amounts of funds is challenging for municipal water utilities which impacts their ability to increase capital spending in order to meet their capital spending challenges many municipalities are examining a combination of privatizations and partnerships with the private sector privatization typically involves a transfer of responsibility for the operation of the utility from the municipality to the private sector and in some cases may involve ownership transfer normally for specified longterm periods with transfer back to the municipality at expiration of the term of the agreement partnerships between municipalities and the private sector include arrangements like om dbo design build operatemaintain and design build own operatemaintain and transfer contracts under these types of contracts the municipality either retains ownership or regains ownership of the water andor wastewater system and the private sector takes responsibility for managing and operating the system 

  

over the next several years we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 800 million and 1 billion per year our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace existing infrastructure as needed and construction of facilities to meet new customer growth the charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures by asset type and purpose of investment respectively 

fragmentation and consolidation 

according to the epa the utility segment of the united states water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented with approximately 52000 community water systems and approximately 16000 community wastewater facilities as shown in the charts below the majority of the approximately 52000 community water systems are very small serving a population of 500 or less 

the following charts set forth the total united states water industry by system type and the total population served by system type respectively for 2008 water statistics 

 

 

  

this large number of relatively small water and wastewater utilities results in inefficiencies in the marketplace since smaller utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities these inefficiencies may lead to industry consolidation in the future as the larger investorowned utilities acquire smaller local water and wastewater systems larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of adverse weather such as droughts excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas larger utilities generally are able to spread overhead expenses over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale and sharing of best practices companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower unit costs and improve service at the same time 

water and wastewater rates 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generate operating revenue from customers based on rates that are established by state pucs through a ratesetting process that may include public hearings evidentiary hearings and the submission by the utility of evidence and testimony in support of the requested level of rates in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on five areas i the amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered “used and useful” in providing public service ii the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service typically by making reference to a representative 12month period of time known as a test year iii the appropriate rate of return iv the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements equitably across the customer base and v the quality of service the utility provides including issues raised by customers 

for most consumers water and wastewater bills make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services 

the following chart sets forth the relative cost of water in the united states as a percentage of total household utility expenditures 

our regulated businesses 

our core regulated businesses which consist of locally managed utility subsidiaries that generally are economically regulated by the states in which they operate accounted for approximately 904 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2009 our regulated businesses provide a high degree of financial stability because i high barriers to entry provide limited protection from competitive pressures ii economic regulation 

  

promotes predictability in financial planning and longterm performance through the ratesetting process and iii our largely residential customer base promotes consistent operating results 

the following table sets forth operating revenue for 2009 and number of customers as well as an estimate of population served as of december 31 2009 for our regulated subsidiaries in the states where our regulated businesses provide services 

 

  

    approximately 834 of operating revenue from our regulated businesses in 2009 was generated from approximately 27 million customers in our seven largest states as measured by operating revenues in fiscal year 2009 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of our annual operating revenue 

overview of networks facilities and water supply 

our regulated businesses operate in approximately 1600 communities in 20 states in the united states our primary operating assets include approximately 80 surface water treatment plants 600 groundwater treatment plants 1200 groundwater wells 50 wastewater treatment facilities 1200 treated water storage facilities 1200 pumping stations and 100 dams and 49000 miles of mains and collection pipes we own substantially all of the assets used by our regulated businesses we generally own the land and physical assets used to store extract and treat source water typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law 

maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our regulated businesses we have ongoing main renewal programs in all states in which our regulated businesses operate these programs consist of both rehabilitation of existing mains and replacement of mains that have reached the end of their useful service life the decision of whether to replace or rehabilitate our mains is subject to considerations of age cost feasibility and customer service impact 

  

our regulated businesses are dependent upon a defined source of water supply our regulated businesses obtain their water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs lakes and rivers and streams in addition we also obtain water from wells and purchase water from other water suppliers 

the following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our regulated businesses for 2009 by volume 

in our longterm planning we are always evaluating quality quantity growth needs and alternate sources sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we use comprehensive planning processes and maintain drought and emergency plans to minimize the impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ sophisticated models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored for all supplies so that supply capacity may be predicted and mitigated as needed through demand management and additional supply development 

the percentage of finished water supply by source type for our top seven states by regulated businesses revenues is as follows 

 

  

    

the level of water treatment that we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source surface water sources such as rivers typically require significant filtration while some groundwater sources such as aquifers require chemical treatment only in addition a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water purveyors treated water is transported through an extensive transmission and distribution network which includes underground pipes above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water to the customers’ premises we also have installed meters to measure the water that we deliver through our distribution network we employ a variety of methods of meter reading to monitor consumption ranging from basic mechanical meters read by traveling meter readers to remote “driveby” electronic meter reading equipment the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading 

the provision of wastewater services involves the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards the treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent and the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of in accordance with local standards 

customers 

we have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our regulated businesses for the purposes of our regulated businesses each customer represents a connection to our water andor wastewater networks as in the case of apartment complexes businesses and many homes multiple individuals may be served by a single connection 

residential customers make up the large majority of customers in all of the states in which we operate in 2009 residential customers accounted for 912 of the customers and 588 of the operating revenue of our regulated businesses residential customers are highly predictable water and wastewater services consumers and they generate stable operating revenue over time and across regions we also serve commercial customers such as shops and businesses industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we supply water to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities and also provide bulk water supplies to other water utilities that distribute them to their own customers 

the following table sets forth the number of water and wastewater customers by customer class for our regulated businesses as of december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

   

the following table sets forth water services operating revenue by customer class and wastewater services operating revenue excluding other water revenues for our regulated businesses for 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 substantially all of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption typically on a monthly basis our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption 

customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions particularly during the summer our water systems experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can have a downward effect on water operating revenue and operating income conversely when weather conditions are extremely dry our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies also serving to reduce customer demand and operating revenue these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands other factors affecting our customers’ usage of water includes declining household sizes in the united states conservation initiatives including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers and the recent deterioration in the economy and credit markets which is having an adverse impact on our industrial and commercial customers’ operational and financial performance 

supplies 

our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals energy and fuel as well as maintenance material and other critical inputs many of these inputs are subject to shortterm price volatility longterm volatility is partially mitigated through existing procurement contracts current supplier continuity plans and the regulatory rate setting process 

because of our geographic diversity we maintain relationships with many chemical equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace and we do not rely on any single entity for a material amount of our supplies we also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and longterm cost effectiveness as a result of our strategic sourcing process and our strong relationships with suppliers we are able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations for example during hurricane katrina we were challenged to locate chemical suppliers not affected by the hurricane as a result of our previously negotiated and established relationships with a network of preferred suppliers we were able to secure a supply of materials and to continue our operations in the affected areas without interruptions 

we have backup energy sources at key facilities or alternative sources are available to us that are able to keep our operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies 

  

regulation 

economic regulation 

our subsidiaries in the states in which we operate our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective state pucs the term “economic regulation” is intended to indicate that these state pucs regulate the economic aspects of service to the public from systems that fall within their jurisdiction but do not generally establish water quality standards that are set by the epa andor state environmental authorities and enforced through state environmental or health agencies state pucs have broad authority derived from state laws and state constitutions under which they operate to regulate many of the economic aspects of the utilities that fall within their jurisdiction for example state pucs issue certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations that may be required for a company to provide public utility services in specific areas of the state they also must approve the rates and conditions under which service is provided to customers and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate although specific authority might differ from state to state in most states these state pucs must approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions in many instances prior to their completion the jurisdiction exercised by each state puc is prescribed by state laws and regulations and therefore varies from state to state regulatory policies not only vary from state to state they may change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

economic regulation of utilities deals with many competing and occasionally conflicting public interests and policy goals the primary responsibility of state pucs is to achieve the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and the utility and its stockholders although the specific approach to economic regulation does vary certain general principles are consistent across the states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate based on the united states constitution and state constitutions that prohibit confiscation of property without due process of law and just compensation as well as state statutory provisions and court precedent utilities are entitled to recover through rates charged to customers prudent and reasonable operating costs as well as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on and recovery of our prudent used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers the state pucs will also generally accord a utility the right to serve specific areas and will also provide investorowned utilities with limited protection from competition because the requirement of an investorowned utility to operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations typically prevents other investorowned utilities from competing with it in the authorized area in return the utility undertakes to provide reliable service on a nondiscriminatory basis to all customers within the authorized area 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to a volumetric charge based on consumption and a base fee component set by a tariff approved by the relevant state puc certain states have utilized a full or partial single rate policy under which all customers in a state or certain regions within a state are charged utilizing a single rate structure regardless of which of our individual systems serves them the single tariff structure is based on costs that are determined on a statewide or intrastate regional basis thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for us and our customers 

the process to obtain approval for a change in rates involves filing a petition or rate case with the state puc on a periodic basis as determined by our capital expenditures needs and our operating costs rate cases are normally initiated by the regulated utility whenever the utility determines it needs to recover increased operating expenses or a return on new capital investment or otherwise determines that its current authorized return is not sufficient given current market conditions to provide a reasonable return on investment typically a rate case will not be filed however unless the current or expected future return is below the allowed rate of return currently authorized by the regulator a state puc may also initiate a rate proceeding or investigation if it believes a utility may be earning in excess of its authorized rate of return rate cases often involve a lengthy and 

  

costly administrative process the utility the state puc staff consumer advocates and any other interveners who may participate in the process prepare and file evidence consisting of supporting testimony and documentation this is presented in public hearings in connection with the rate case these hearings which are economic and service quality factfinding in nature are typically conducted in a triallike setting before the state puc or an administrative law judge during the process the utility is required to provide staff and interveners with all relevant information they may request concerning the utility’s operations expenses and investments the sworn evidentiary record then forms the basis for a state puc decision 

some state pucs are more restrictive than others with regard to the types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their ratemaking processes and how they reach their final rate determinations however in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on five areas 

 

  

  

  

  

 the decisions of state pucs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete therefore there is frequently a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates for instance an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not appropriately reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until the next rate case is filed and approved by the state puc our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files a rate case with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital that are permitted by the state puc 

our regulated subsidiaries also pursue methods to minimize the adverse impact of regulatory lag and have worked with state pucs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result a number of states in which our regulated businesses operate have adopted efficient rate policies including some form of single tariff pricing forwardlooking test years passthrough provisions or infrastructure surcharges states that have adopted a full or partially single tariff pricing policy include pennsylvania new jersey west virginia kentucky ohio indiana illinois and iowa 

forwardlooking test years and infrastructure surcharges reduce the regulatory lag associated with the traditional method of recovering rates from state pucs forwardlooking test year mechanisms allow us to earn on a more timely basis a return of our current or projected costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital and other “known and measurable changes” in our business some states have permitted use of a fully forecasted test year instead of historical data to set rates examples of these states include illinois kentucky new york tennessee and california in all states in which we operate on a regulated basis pucs have allowed utilities to update historical data for some changes that occur for some limited period of time 

  

subsequent to the historical test year this allows utilities to take account of some more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process the extent to which historical data can be updated will generally vary from state to state and whether the changes are known and measurable 

also an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs such as a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure or increases in expenses beyond the utility’s control such as purchased water costs this infrastructure surcharge mechanism allows our rates to be adjusted and charged to customers outside the context of a general rate proceeding for prespecified portions of our capital expenditures to replace aging infrastructure closer to the time these capital projects are placed in service for example pennsylvania illinois missouri indiana new york california and ohio are examples of states that have in the past allowed tariffs that permit the imposition of surcharges on customers’ bills for infrastructure replacement new jersey california virginia and illinois have allowed surcharges for purchased water costs california has allowed surcharges for power and conservation and new york has allowed surcharges for certain costs such as power and chemicals these constructive regulatory mechanisms encourage us to maintain a steady capital expenditure program to repair and improve water and wastewater systems as needed by reducing the regulatory lag on the recovery of prudent expenditures 

also some of the states in which we operate permit passthrough provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs such as purchased power and property taxes to be passed on to and recovered from customers outside of a general rate case proceeding 

another regulatory mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag includes the potential ability in certain circumstances to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is in service instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include texas pennsylvania ohio kentucky virginia illinois and california 

in addition some states have permitted us to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the pucs assess the prudency of such projects 

recently the state of california has decoupled revenues from water sold this progressive regulation enables utilities to focus on conservation as revenues are not tied to sales also as a result of this regulation utilities would be less susceptible to consumption changes as a result of weather conditions 

the ability of the company to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case however the company strives to use these and other regulatory policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate and to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater we are also subject to certain regulations regarding fire protection services in the areas we serve these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we also are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

  

we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy including responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural resources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are in material compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples across our water system are analyzed on a regular basis in material compliance with regulatory requirements across the company we conduct over one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities and plant operations including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2009 we achieved greater than a 999 compliance rate for meeting state and federal drinking water standards and 995 for compliance with wastewater requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water the united states epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for increasing protection against microbial contaminants with 67 of our plants receiving the program’s “director” award we account for approximately onethird of all plants receiving such award nationwide and almost all of the 67 plants have maintained the award for more than five years 

safe drinking water act 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly more stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns 

for example in 2001 the epa decreased permissible arsenic levels in drinking water and required compliance by water systems by january 2006 in 2003 a new epa rule governing nonradon radionuclides became effective regulating uranium in drinking water for the first time and requiring initial monitoring under state programs by the end of 2007 we believe that we are in material compliance with both of these rules 

in order to remove or inactivate microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources in 2006 the epa also proposed revisions to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule in 2010 we anticipate that the epa will propose revisions to the total coliform rule we have been actively involved in the revisions to this rule and was part of a federal advisory committee appointed to negotiate the changes 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by state public utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our wastewater collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system 

  

npdes permit program established under the clean water act pursuant to the npdes program the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems we believe that we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes which require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the united states occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see “business—research and development” 

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters these proceedings are described further in the section entitled “item 3—legal proceedings” 

competition and condemnation 

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct or indirect competition in providing services in our existing markets because i we operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a barrier to market entry our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities and strategic buyers in connection with entering new markets and making strategic acquisitions consolidation is changing the competitive landscape as small local utilities struggle to meet their capital spending requirements and look to partner with investorowned utilities we also face competition in offering services to new real estate developers where we compete with others on the basis of the financial terms we offer for our services the availability of water and our ability to commence providing services on a timely basis our largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environment company sa american states water co and california water services group 

the certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations pursuant to which we operate our regulated businesses do not prevent municipalities from competing with us to provide water and wastewater utility services further the potential exists that portions of our subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods 

 

  

  

 the sale price for such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or the price may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter we believe our operating subsidiaries would be entitled to fair 

  

market value for any assets required to be sold and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets 

we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business on september 5 2008 pursuant to a condemnation proceeding california american water sold the assets of our felton california water system which served approximately 1330 customers to the san lorenzo valley water district the most recent prior sale of our water and wastewater systems under threat of condemnation occurred in 2003 we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses 

our nonregulated businesses 

in addition to our regulated businesses we operate the following nonregulated businesses which generated 2577 million of operating revenue in 2009 representing 106 of total operating revenue for the same periods of the groups outlined below no single group within our nonregulated businesses generates in excess of 10 of our aggregate revenue 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including om and dbo contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities the united states military and other customers we typically make no capital investment under our contracts with municipalities and other customers instead performing our services for a fee we may make limited capital investments under our contracts with the united states military and certain industrial customers our contract operations group generated revenue of 1561 million in 2009 representing 606 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses 

we are currently party to 52 contracts across the united states and canada with contracts ranging in term from three to 50 years the services provided under our om contracts vary in size and scope for instance 44 of our om contracts are operational in nature with repair and replace elements but not dbos annual operating revenue from the om contracts varies from 03 million to 82 million per contract in addition we are an active participant in the united states department of defense’s utility privatization program or upp the department of defense has awarded us nine 50year contracts for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems since 2003 and we have one 3year subcontract with a municipality acting as primary contractor with the department of defense for similar services on an interim basis until construction of new connections to an existing municipal facility is completed remaining lifetime revenue under all these om contracts total approximately 34020 million as of december 31 2009 all of the contracts with the us government may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event we are entitled to recover the remaining amount of our capital investment pursuant to the terms of a termination settlement with the us government at the time of termination as provided in each of the contracts the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions 

in general the contract operations group is engaged in providing these services to systems with over 3000 customers and in many cases far larger as distinguished from the om services provided by our applied water management group usually to systems with less than 3000 customers however there is some overlap in size of systems served due to geographic and operational considerations 

we combined all contract operations activities including applied water management group’s 196 contracts and our newly acquired subsidiary emc into one operating unit emc provides om services to 26 municipalities and 28 industrial customers the contract operations group will commence operating as a combined unit on january 1 2010 

  

applied water management group 

our applied water management group works with customers to design build and operate smallerscale water and wastewater treatment plants typically serving up to 3000 customers our typical customers are real estate developers industrial companies and new or expanding communities we specialize in providing reliable advanced and ecofriendly water and wastewater solutions to suit each customer’s water needs our applied water management group generated revenue of 195 million in 2009 representing 76 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses 

the applied water management group currently serves our customer base primarily in the northeastern united states and was responsible for the design construction and operation of advanced wastewater treatment recycling systems for sites as varied as residential buildings in battery park city in new york city and gillette stadium in foxborough massachusetts 

as stated above under “contract operations group” we aligned all our contract operations activities into a single operating group effective january 1 2010 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes we initially offered these services within territories covered by our regulated subsidiaries but are expanding to enable other utilities outside our territories to offer the services to their customers in the marketing of these services we focus on educating homeowners about their service line ownership responsibility and providing convenient and cost effective solutions to internal and external water line and sewer line repairs our homeowner services group generated revenue of 522 million in 2009 representing 203 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses 

our service line protection programs offer customers various service contracts for a monthly fee that cover repair of water line leaks and breaks sewer line clogs and blockages and emergency inhome plumbing problems in the event of a problem customers contact our national call center and we dispatch local contractors to the customer’s home to undertake the necessary repairs 

our homeowners services group currently has approximately 750000 customer contracts in 16 of the states where we operate our regulated businesses we intend to expand our service offering to the remaining key states in which we operate our regulated businesses as well as other viable territories 

building on the success of its service line protection programs our homeowner services group recently introduced linesaver™ an exclusive program for municipalities and public water systems that is available across the country the linesaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipal system while providing an income opportunity to the municipality or public water system we entered into our first linesaver™ program partnership with the city of trenton new jersey and are currently discussing partnerships with municipalities across the nation 

other nonregulated businesses 

our nonregulated businesses also include i our carbon services group which provides granular activated carbon for water purification to our regulated businesses as well as certain outside customers and ii our residuals group terratec which is located in canada and provides environmentally sustainable management and disposal of biosolids and wastewater byproducts our united statesbased residuals group was divested effective june 29 2007 these other nonregulated businesses generated revenue of 299 million in 2009 in the aggregate representing 116 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses 

  

competition 

we face competition in our nonregulated businesses from a number of service providers including veolia environnement american states omi and southwest water particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competitive as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as these frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process 

growth 

in the course of pursuing our growth strategy we periodically acquire water and wastewater utilities by making acquisitions in our existing markets and certain markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses we have executed a number of larger acquisitions in the past 15 years these acquisitions totaling approximately 21 billion broadened our footprint in then existing states geographies 

we also acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuckins the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies historically pursuing tuckins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate certain markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses 

the chart below sets forth our historical tuckins for 2006 through december 2009 

during 2007 new jersey american water company inc “njawc” entered into an agreement with the city of trenton new jersey the “city” to purchase the assets of the city’s outside water system located in four surrounding townships the initial proposed purchase price of 100 million was subsequently amended to 75 million plus the provision of technical services by the city over seven years at a total cost to njawc of 50 million to ensure a smooth ownership transition the amended agreement also requires njawc to purchase finished water from the city of trenton for a period of 20 years after closing under a water supply agreement 

since february 2009 a small group of city residents “petitioners” has been involved in litigation with the city and njawc seeking to force the sale to a referendum on december 19 2009 the new jersey superior court appellate panel published its decision unanimously upholding a march 2009 trial court decision in favor of the city and njawc the new jersey supreme court “supreme court” has granted the petitioners’ request for certification and oral argument is scheduled before the supreme court on march 22 2010 the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of litigation the acquisition is expected to add approximately 40000 customers to njawc’s customer base 

  

while our business mix will continue to focus predominantly on regulated activities we are pursuing opportunities in nonregulated businesses that are complementary to our regulated businesses and our capabilities our nonregulated focus centers around publicprivate partnerships including municipalities and divisions of the united states department of defense as well as industrial customers we will continue to capitalize on our om expertise and our existing municipal and federal government relationships while building on our newly acquired subsidiary’s emc customer base in the industrial sector in identifying and bidding for new ventures that have attractive risk and return characteristics we will also expand our nonregulated homeowner services business which provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes in areas within and beyond our existing regulated footprint and to small commercial establishments 

research and development 

we established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our businesses our research and development personnel are located at two of our facilities the regional center in voorhees new jersey and our research laboratory in delran new jersey in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports research through sophisticated testing and analysis since its inception our research and development program has evolved to become a leading waterrelated research program achieving advancements in the science of drinking water including sophisticated water testing procedures and desalination technologies 

since the formation of the epa in 1970 we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa has helped us to achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

in 2009 we spent 275 million on research and development which represents an increase of 10 over the 25 million spent in 2008 approximately onethird of our research budget is comprised of competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers 

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical to providing quality and reliable service at reasonable rates maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

support services 

our american water works service company subsidiary provides centrally administered professional services to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services which are provided at cost may include accounting administration business development communications corporate secretarial engineering financial health and safety human resources information systems legal operations procurement rates security risk management water quality and research and development similar services may be provided to our nonregulated businesses these arrangements afford our affiliated companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis 

we operate two national customer service centers with personnel located in alton illinois and pensacola florida these centers employ approximately 700 people in total 

  

employee matters 

currently we employ approximately 7700 fulltime employees of these approximately 3900 or 51 are represented by unions we have 84 collective bargaining agreements in place with the 18 different unions representing our unionized employees approximately onefourth of our local union contracts expire annually we maintain good relations with our unionized workforce and have no significant history of strikes or labor stoppages 

security 

in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks and other risks we have heightened security at our facilities over the past several years and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to our customers we have a security programs department that provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing implementing monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls 

in 2002 federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities including those that required companies to submit vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements in addition communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs we have been in contact with federal state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position or results of operations which in turn could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

risks related to our industry and business 

our utility operations are subject to extensive economic regulation decisions by state pucs and other regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are economically regulated by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant effect on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses to enable us to finance the addition of new or the replacement of existing water and wastewater infrastructure and to allow us the opportunity to earn what they determine to be an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

our ability to meet our financial objectives depends upon the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted even if approved there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses the recovery of our investment andor provide us an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment if the authorized rates are insufficient to cover operating expenses to allow for the recovery of our investment and to provide an appropriate return on invested capital or if the rate increase decisions are delayed our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital andor a return of our invested capital that are permitted by state pucs as billings to customers are based on usage rather than a fixed amount 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations compliance with increasingly stringent laws and regulations could impact our operating costs and violations of such laws and regulations could subject the company to substantial liabilities and costs 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include the united states clean water act of 1972 which we refer to as the clean water act and the united states safe drinking water act of 1974 which we refer to as the safe drinking water act the amendments to and reauthorizations of the clean water and safe drinking acts and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs or damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to an issuer not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

  

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws and regulations and other health and safety and water quality regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement have tended to become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases to recover such costs or that such costs will not adversely and materially affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations requiring us to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties including potential spills of hazardous chemicals such as chlorine which we use to treat water or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused adverse environmental impacts the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity such remediation costs may not be covered by our insurance policies and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

any governmental entity that regulates our operations may enact new legislation or adopt new regulations or policies at any time and new judicial decisions may change the interpretation of existing legislation or regulations at any time the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or changes in agency policy including those as a response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

any of these changes or any other changes in laws regulations judicial decisions or agency policies applicable to us may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

availability of water supplies restrictions on use natural hazards weather conditions and competing uses may interfere with our sources of water demand for water services and our ability to supply water to customers 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as such we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements can change from time to time and adversely impact our water supply drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water 

governmental restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas if a regional drought were to occur affecting our service areas and adjacent systems governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system there were voluntary conservation efforts or water use restrictions implemented during certain periods of 2009 in parts of indiana new york and california following drought conditions water demand may not return to predrought levels even after restrictions are lifted 

service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas these include winter storms and freezing conditions in our colder climate service areas high wind conditions in our service areas known to experience tornados earthquakes in our service areas known to experience seismic activity high water conditions for our facilities located in or near designated flood plains hurricanes in our coastal service areas and severe electrical storms which are possible across all of our service areas these weather events may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage any interruption in our ability to supply water or to collect treat and properly dispose of wastewater or any costs associated with restoring service could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore losses from business interruptions or damage to our facilities might not be covered by our insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

our business is impacted significantly by weather conditions which are subject to fluctuations these fluctuations could adversely affect demand for our water service and our revenues 

demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with irrigation systems swimming pools cooling systems and other outside water use throughout the year and particularly during typically warmer months demand tends to vary with temperature rainfall levels and rainfall frequency in the event that temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than normal if there is more rainfall than normal andor rainfall is more frequent than normal the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 

  

declining residential per customer water usage may reduce our longterm revenues financial condition and results of operations 

increased water conservation including through the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers combined with declining household sizes in the united states has contributed to a trend of declining residential per customer water usage our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use the rate we charge for our water is regulated by state pucs and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect demand declining usage will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or to grow our residential customer base to the extent necessary to offset the residential usage decline 

regulatory and environmental risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection or sewage systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages which may not be recoverable in rates this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition moreover in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow our losses might not be covered by insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures to maintain infrastructure and expand our rate base and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we suffer delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is very capital intensive in addition to our acquisition strategy we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2009 we invested 7853 million in net companyfunded capital improvements we expect the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems to increase in the future we fund these projects from cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and through the issuance of longterm debt and equity securities we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all 

in addition we believe that our dividend policy could limit but not preclude our ability to pursue growth in particular this limitation could be significant for example with respect to large acquisitions and growth opportunities that require cash investments in amounts greater than our available cash or external financing resources in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions including tuckin acquisitions principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we expect that we will need additional financing however we intend to retain sufficient cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital expenditures 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we may fail to maintain our existing property plant and equipment realize our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and successfully expand the rate base upon which we are able to earn future returns on our investment and a return of our investment even if we have adequate resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital expenditures on time as a result of construction delays or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we also face the risk that after we make substantial capital expenditures the rate increases granted to us by state pucs may not be 

  

sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses and to allow us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we own approximately 100 dams a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and downstream property damage downstream for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

we also are required from time to time to repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs can be and has been material we might not be able to recover such costs through rates the inability to recover these higher costs or regulatory lag in the recovery of such costs can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams federal and state agencies are currently considering rules and regulations that could require us to strengthen or dismantle one of our dams on the carmel river in california due to safety concerns related to seismic activity any requirement to strengthen or dismantle this dam could result in substantial costs that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we are currently engaged in negotiations with federal and state agencies and local stakeholders on a plan to maintain our existing carmel river dams or to share the costs of dismantling one of them with those federal and state agencies and local stakeholders these negotiations could be delayed or abandoned 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and collect wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in reservoirs located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries to civil or criminal enforcement actions private litigation and cleanup obligations 

our water supplies are subject to contamination including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and possible terrorist attacks in the event that our water supply is contaminated we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply of water from another water source including in some cases through the purchase of water from a thirdparty supplier in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods if we are unable to substitute water supply in a costeffective manner our financial condition results of operations cash flow liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected we might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or 

  

decontaminating water supplies through rates or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort or other lawsuits or criminal enforcement actions or other consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 

our liquidity and earnings could be adversely affected by increases in our production costs including the cost of chemicals electricity fuel or other significant materials used in the water and wastewater treatment process 

we incur significant production costs in connection with the delivery of our water and wastewater services our production costs are driven by purchased water chemicals used to treat water and wastewater as well as electricity and fuel which are used to operate pumps and other equipment used in water treatment and delivery and wastewater collection treatment and disposal we also incur production costs for waste disposal for 2009 production costs accounted for 229 of our total operations and maintenance costs these costs can and do increase sometimes unexpectedly and in substantial amounts as occurred in illinois during 2007 when the cost of electricity rose substantially 

our regulated businesses might not be able to recover increases in the costs of chemicals electricity fuel other significant inputs or waste disposal through rates or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner our nonregulated businesses may not be able to recover these costs in contract prices or other terms the inability to recover these higher costs can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

our reliance on thirdparty suppliers poses significant risks to our business and prospects 

we contract with third parties for goods and services that are essential to our operations such as maintenance services pipes chemicals electricity water gasoline diesel and other materials we are subject to substantial risks because of our reliance on these suppliers for example 

 

  

  

  

  

 as a result of any of these factors we may be required to find alternative suppliers for the raw materials and services on which we rely accordingly we may experience delays in obtaining appropriate raw materials and services on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities from such alternative suppliers at a reasonable price which could interrupt services to our customers and adversely affect our revenues financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

risks associated with potential acquisitions or investments may adversely affect us 

we will continue to seek to acquire or invest in additional regulated water or wastewater systems including acquiring systems in markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses and through tuckins we will also continue to seek to enter into publicprivate partnerships including om 

  

military and design build and operate which we refer to as dbo contracts and services that complement our businesses these transactions may result in 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may also experience difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals for acquisitions and any regulatory approvals we obtain may require us to agree to costly and restrictive conditions imposed by regulators we may not identify all significant risks when conducting due diligence for a transaction and we could be exposed to potential liabilities for which we will not be indemnified there may be difficulties integrating new businesses including bringing newly acquired businesses up to the necessary level of regulatory compliance retaining and integrating key personnel achieving strategic objectives and integrating acquired assets and technological systems the demands of identifying and transitioning newly acquired businesses or pursuing investment opportunities may also divert management’s attention from other business concerns and otherwise disrupt our business any of these risks may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the global economic and financial market environment may adversely affect our business and operations 

the existing and continuing global economic and financial market environment has caused among other things a general tightening in the credit markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending and lower consumer net worth all of which could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our customers and suppliers may or will be severely affected by the current economic turmoil current or potential customers and suppliers may no longer be in business may be unable to continue to pay for our services or may decide to reduce their consumption of our services all of which could lead to reduced demand for our services reduced operating income an increased incidence of customer payment delays or defaults for services delivered further suppliers may not be able to supply us in a timely manner may increase prices or go out of business which could result in our inability to meet consumer demand as such a continuing negative global economic and financial market environment could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

capital markets have experienced a significant period of dislocation and instability which could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on our revolving credit facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs disruptions in the credit markets changes in our credit ratings or deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition could discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we borrowed under our existing 840 million revolving credit facility commitments under this revolving credit facility of 685 million mature on september 15 2013 and the remaining 155 million of commitments expire on september 15 2012 american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary had no outstanding borrowings and 482 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 24 2010 awcc had 589 million of outstanding commercial paper as of february 24 2010 we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

  

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing or suspending dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures 

the resulting lack of available credit and increased volatility in the financial markets or changes to our credit ratings could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and our ability to manage our liquidity in particular as a result of higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities increased commercial paper borrowing costs and increased costs related to variable rate debt the company’s interest expense could increase and adversely impact our results of operations 

the capital market disruptions could result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities and increased commercial paper borrowing costs as a result continuation of the market disruptions could increase the company’s interest expense and adversely impact our results of operations 

market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations which may affect investment returns that may fall below the company’s projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as was experienced in 2009 will increase the funding requirements under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value additionally the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or increases in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans also future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable in rates and our the results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations or require us to effect additional dilutive equity issuances 

our total assets include substantial goodwill at december 31 2009 our goodwill totaled 12504 million the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of rwe in 2003 and the acquisition of e’town corporation in 2001 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable annual impairment reviews are performed at november 30 of each year and interim reviews are performed when management determines that a triggering event has occurred we have been required to reflect as required by the applicable accounting rules noncash charges to operating results for goodwill impairment in the amounts of 4500 million 7500 million 5093 million and 2278 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these amounts include impairments relating to discontinued operations as a result of these impairments net income was reduced by 4430 million 7385 million 5015 million and 2236 million in 2009 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

the company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

our regulated businesses compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities as well as strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities which may hinder our ability to grow our business 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities as well as strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities including tuckins our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities near our existing operations thereby preventing us from acquiring them competing governmental entities utilities and strategic and financial buyers have challenged and may in the future challenge our applications for new service territories our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new territories with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations or that can submit more attractive bids 

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized movements may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through the governmental power of eminent domain should a municipality or other government subdivision seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain we may resist the acquisition contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated business’s management from the operation of its business 

on september 5 2008 under threat of condemnation california american water sold the assets of our felton california water system which served approximately 1330 customers to the san lorenzo valley water district if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges 

our nonregulated businesses through american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees and other forms of financial security to our publicsector clients that could be claimed by our clients or potential clients if we do not meet certain obligations 

under the terms of some of our indebtedness and some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding its regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of the performance of our nonregulated businesses including financial guarantees or deposits to ensure performance of certain obligations at december 31 2009 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 34020 million and this amount is likely to increase if our nonregulated businesses grow the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms in addition if the obligor on the instrument fails to perform certain obligations to the satisfaction of the party that holds the performance commitments that party 

  

may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity could be adversely affected 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to maintain those systems which will negatively affect us as the operators of the systems 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner to undertake capital improvements in some cases we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner 

our nonregulated businesses are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received 

some of our nonregulated businesses enter into longterm contracts pursuant to which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee our nonregulated businesses are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party in addition directly or through our nonregulated subsidiaries we often guarantee our nonregulated businesses’ obligations under those contracts losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

we rely on our it systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and cause our results of operations to be reduced we depend on our it systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections our it systems also allow us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers our it systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 such damages or interruptions may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and similar events in addition the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact on the company of any of the foregoing events 

  

in addition we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our business transformation initiative involves risks could result in higher than expected costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations and profitability 

we have undertaken a business transformation project that is intended to upgrade our antiquated and manual processes and systems in order to build efficiencies and provide more cost effective service to our customers this multiyear enterprisewide initiative is intended to further support our broader strategic initiatives the project is intended to optimize workflow throughout our field operations improve our backoffice operations and enhance our customer service capabilities the scale and anticipated future costs associated with the business transformation project are significant and we could incur significant costs in excess of what we are planning to spend any technical or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative may result in delays which in turn may increase the costs of the project when we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure further we may not realize the cost improvements and greater efficiencies we hope for as a result of the project in addition we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely or adequate rate recovery of these increased costs associated with the transformation project 

currently we operate numerous systems that have varying degrees of integration which can lead to inefficiencies workarounds and rework as such delays in the initiative being put into service will also delay cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the project we may also experience difficulties consolidating our current systems moving to a common set of operational processes and implementing a successful change management process these difficulties may impact our customers and our ability to meet their needs efficiently any such delays or difficulties may have a material and adverse impact on our business client relationships and financial results 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2009 our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 54857 million and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our credit facilities or be required to issue new debt securities in the capital markets we can provide no assurances 

  

that we will be able to access the debt capital markets or do so on favorable terms if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our control if we do not have sufficient cash flow to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business that would prevent us from maintaining or increasing our business and cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 

our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger prepayment obligations 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in us being required to repay or refinance on less favorable terms these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to repay or refinance on less favorable terms these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates in 2007 we were not in compliance with reporting covenants contained in some of the debt agreements of our subsidiaries such defaults under the reporting covenants were caused by our delay in producing our 2006 quarterly and audited annual consolidated financial statements we have obtained all necessary waivers under the agreements we can provide no assurance that we will comply in the future with all our reporting covenants and will not face an event of default under our debt agreements or that such default will be cured or waived 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

currently approximately 3900 of our employees or 51 of our total workforce are unionized and represented by 18 different unions approximately onefourth of our 84 union collective bargaining agreements expire annually with 21 agreements covering 1081 employees scheduled to expire before the end of 2010 we might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are favorable to us and negotiations or dispute resolutions undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or become subject to the risk of labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may all adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting existed during 2009 if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis any inability to report and file our financial results in an accurate and timely manner could harm our business and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock 

as a public company we are required to comply with the sarbanesoxley act and other rules and regulations that govern public companies in particular we are required to certify our compliance with 

section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act for the year ended december 31 2009 which requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles however from 2003 until the completion of our initial public 

  

offering in april 2008 as an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe we were not required to maintain a system of effective internal controls or comply with the requirements of the sec and the sarbanesoxley act nor to prepare our own consolidated financial statements in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2006 we and our independent registered public accountants identified six material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting each of which could have resulted in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements since that time we have addressed all areas of material weakness as of december 31 2009 we and our independent registered public accountants have tested the effectiveness of controls designated to address the weaknesses and based on the results of these tests no longer consider these control deficiencies to be material weaknesses for further discussion see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—our internal control and remediation initiatives” moreover we cannot provide assurance that we have identified all or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses any of which may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and cause future delays in filing our financial statements and periodic reports with the sec any such delays in the filing of our financial statements and periodic reports may result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions could be imposed on us by the sec we believe that any such misstatements or delays could negatively impact our liquidity access to capital markets financial condition and the market value of our common stock or cause a downgrade in the credit ratings of american water or awcc

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in 2001 cawc entered into a conservation agreement with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which we refer to as noaa requiring cawc to implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the carmel river watershed study the removal of the san clemente dam and explore longterm water sources other than a new reservoir in the carmel river since that time cawc has implemented a number of measures to reduce the impact of its operations on the steelhead trout and other species and has begun the environmental review and permitting process for construction of a water desalination plant which is intended to provide an alternate water source for the monterey peninsula and in part to address some of the foregoing concerns relating to withdrawals from carmel river in early 2004 noaa informed cawc of its concern that cawc’s ongoing operations would cause the “take” of significant numbers of steelhead trout during the several remaining years required to implement the coastal water project in june 2006 cawc and noaa entered a settlement agreement whereby cawc agreed to fund certain additional projects to improve habitat conditions for and aid in the recovery of steelhead trout in the carmel river watershed under the settlement agreement cawc is required among other things to make an initial payment of 35 million plus six annual installments of 11 million the settlement agreement requires that all payments made by cawc to noaa be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed noaa has agreed not to assess any penalties or otherwise prosecute cawc for any “take” of steelhead trout so long as cawc complies with the settlement agreement effective march 3 2009 the company and noaa executed an amended settlement agreement to allow the required payments to be made to and managed by a california state agency under an existing mitigation program thereby ensuring that settlement payments will be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed consistent with the amended agreement the company paid an initial 35 million in april 2009 and is scheduled to make the first 11 million installment payment in july 2010 the settlement agreement also requires the company and noaa to meet and negotiate a resolution to noaa’s concerns regarding changes to the company’s operations on the carmel river to protect the fish and improve its habitat the company and noaa are currently engaged in this second phase of negotiations on march 14 2008 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association notified cawc of their intent to file a citizen suit 60 days therefrom for violations of the federal endangered species act alleging the “take” of steelhead trout by cawc along the carmel river and seeking injunctive relief to reduce river water diversions and increase river flow and fish passage facilities on june 25 2009 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association filed suit seeking to enjoin the company’s pumping on the carmel river the suit was dismissed on the company’s motion on january 8 2010 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association also filed an administrative complaint with the california state water resources control board in december 2008 claiming that certain fish passage facilities do not meet existing permit requirements cawc also undertakes activities to protect the threatened california redlegged frog and its habitat in the carmel river pursuant to a prior agreement with the us fish and wildlife service “usfws” this agreement is currently expired and cawc is in discussions with usfws to renew the agreement 

in addition the state water resources control board held administrative hearings in the summer of 2008 to address claims that cawc has exceeded its water diversion rights in the carmel river and has not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by an administrative order issued to cawc by the state water resources control board in 1995 the state water resources control board adopted a cease and desist order to cawc on october 20 2009 the order finds that cawc has not sufficiently implemented actions to terminate its unpermitted diversions from the carmel river as required by an administrative order issued to cawc by the state water resources control board in 1995 the order requires among other things that cawc significantly decrease its yearly diversions from the river according to a set reduction schedule running from the date the order was adopted until december 31 2016 at which point all unpermitted diversions must end the order also requires that cawc plan design and implement within twentyfour months of the date the order was adopted projects designed to reduce the need for carmel river diversions we have appealed the order to the superior court of california challenging the findings and requirements of the order we cannot assure you however that the appeal will be successful or that if unsuccessful we will be able to comply with the requirements under the order or that any such compliance will not result in material additional costs or obligations to us 

  

in february 2004 the new jersey department of environmental protection which we refer to as njdep issued to njawc a notice of violation alleging that njawc had exceeded annual diversion limits contained in njaw’s water allocation permits for certain wells in our lakewood system during the years 2001 through 2003 njdep initially assessed a penalty of 06 million njawc subsequently submitted a voluntary statewide self disclosure report identifying all such exceedances for the period of 1999 through 2003 in december 2007 njawc finalized an administrative consent order with njdep to resolve the above violations under which njawc has paid a civil fine of 01 million and has undertaken a 04 million environmental project the project report is the lone aspect of the project remaining and we currently expect that aspect to be completed before the end of 2010 we believe that njawc is operating in compliance with the applicable diversion limits in its water allocation permits 

terratec our canadian subsidiary is subject to and has been complying with an order by the ontario ministry of the environment which we refer to as moe issued on october 31 2006 requiring it to take steps to thicken certain biosolids that had been more susceptible to spillage during transport moe conducted an investigation and laid charges against terratec relating to four such transport spillage incidents involving terratec that occurred prior to the issuance of the order in december 2008 terratec and the moe agreed that terratec would pay a fine of cdn 300000 plus a 25 surcharge to resolve these charges the fine has been paid and this matter is now complete 

periodically we are involved in other proceedings or litigation arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially affect our financial position or results of operations

overview 

founded in 1886 american water is the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served our more than 7000 employees provide drinking water wastewater and other waterrelated services to more than 16 million people in 35 states and two canadian provinces in 2009 we generated 24407 million in total operating revenue representing approximately four times the operating revenue of the next largest investorowned company in the united states water and wastewater business and 1736 million in operating income which includes 4500 million of impairment charges relating to continuing operations and a net loss of 2331 million 

our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial and industrial customers our regulated businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters our regulated businesses currently provide services in 20 states and in 2009 served approximately 33 million customers or connections to our water and wastewater networks we report the results of this business in our regulated businesses segment for the year ended december 31 2009 our regulated businesses generated 22073 million in operating revenue prior to intersegment eliminations representing 904 of our consolidated operating revenue 

we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs our nonregulated businesses include our 

 

  

  

 we report these results in our nonregulated businesses segment for the year ended december 31 2009 our nonregulated businesses generated 2577 million in operating revenue prior to intersegment eliminations 

  

history 

prior to being acquired by rwe in 2003 we were the largest publicly traded water utility company as measured by both operating revenue and population served in the united states in 2003 we were acquired by rwe and became a private company in 2005 rwe decided to divest american water in march 2006 rwe decided to divest american water through the sale of shares in one or more public offerings in order to become a public company once again we have had to incur substantial initial costs including costs associated with ensuring adequate internal control over financial reporting in order to achieve compliance with the sarbanesoxley act 

upon the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008 we again became listed on the nyse rwe aqua holdings gmbh the selling stockholder sold approximately 632 million shares of the company’s common stock at that time at december 31 2008 rwe owned approximately 60 of the company’s shares of common stock on june 10 2009 and august 18 2009 rwe continued to divest of its investment in our common stock through public offerings of an additional 154 million shares and 403 million shares respectively in november 2009 rwe completed its divestiture of the company in a public offering of the remaining 411 million shares of our common stock including 37 million sold upon underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option as a result of the full exercise of the underwriter’s option rwe fully divested of their interest in our common stock 

our internal control and remediation initiatives 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles however from 2003 to april 28 2008 we were an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe and as a privately owned company were not required to comply with the requirements of the sec and the sarbanesoxley act or to prepare our own consolidated financial statements as a public reporting company we are required among other things to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting suitable to prepare our publicly reported financial statements in a timely and accurate manner and also to evaluate and report on such system of internal control in particular we are required to certify our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act for the year ended december 31 2009 which required us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2006 we and our independent registered public accountants identified six material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting each of which could have resulted in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements since that time we addressed all areas of material weakness as of december 31 2009 we have tested the effectiveness of controls designated to address the weaknesses and based on the results of these tests no longer consider these control deficiencies to be material weaknesses for further discussion see “risk factors—risks related to our industry and business” 

as of december 31 2009 the company had incurred 584 million most of which were for contracted services to remediate these material weaknesses and to document and test key financial reporting controls as a condition to state puc approval of the rwe divestiture we agreed that costs incurred in connection with our initial internal control and remediation initiatives would not be recoverable in rates charged to our customers 

  

factors affecting our results of operations 

as the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industrywide factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition since our acquisition by rwe in 2003 our results of operations have also been significantly influenced by goodwill impairments see “goodwill impairment” 

factors that may affect the results of operations of our regulated businesses’ operating performance are mitigated by state pucs granting us appropriate rate relief that is designed to allow us to recover prudently incurred expenses and to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment 

economic utility regulation 

our subsidiaries in the states in which we operate our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective state pucs although specific authority might differ from state to state in most states these state pucs must approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions in many instances prior to their completion regulatory policies not only vary from state to state they may change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and our actual return on invested capital 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to the volume of water supplied to a customer multiplied by a pricepergallon set by a tariff approved by the relevant state puc the process to obtain approval for a change in rates or rate case involves filing a petition with the state puc on a periodic basis as determined by our capital expenditures needs water usage and our operating costs rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to a year or more to complete therefore there is frequently a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment a consumption decrease or incurs an operating expense increase and when those items are reflected in rates the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries works to minimize regulatory lag 

our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the state pucs in the states in which we operate and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate stayouts and delayed or inadequate rate recovery in addition to general rate case filings we generate revenues through other cost recovery procedures for example some states in which we operate allow utility subsidiaries to begin recovery of system infrastructure replacement costs without the necessity of filing a full rate proceeding since infrastructure replacement is a significant element of capital expenditures made by our subsidiaries such programs can reduce regulatory lag 

  

currently pennsylvania illinois missouri indiana new york california and ohio have allowed the use of these infrastructure surcharges these surcharges adjust periodically based on qualified capital expenditures being completed or anticipated in a future period these surcharges are typically reset to zero when new base rates are effective and incorporate the costs of these infrastructure expenditures in 2009 we were granted an additional 246 million in revenues assuming constant sales volumes from such surcharges in several of our states furthermore we were granted a 20 million increase for an arsenic surcharge in our arizona subsidiary allowing recovery for costs associated with the construction and operation of arsenic treatment facilities 

also some of the states in which we operate permit passthrough provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs such as purchased power purchased water and property taxes to be passed onto and recovered from the customers outside of a full rate proceeding 

some states have permitted use of a fully forecasted test year instead of historical data to set rates examples of these states include illinois kentucky new york tennessee and california in all states in which we operate on a regulated basis pucs have allowed utilities to update historical data for some changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year this allows utilities to take account of some more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process the extent in which historical data can be updated will generally vary from state to state and whether the changes are known and measurable 

another regulatory mechanism intended to address issues of regulatory lag includes the ability in some circumstances to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is actually in service instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include texas pennsylvania ohio kentucky virginia illinois and california 

the infrastructure surcharge passthrough provisions the forwardlooking test year and the allowance of a return on utility plant before it is actually in service are examples of mechanisms that present an opportunity to limit the risks associated with regulatory lag we employ each of these mechanisms as part of our rate case management program to ensure efficient recovery of our costs and investment and to ensure positive shortterm liquidity and longterm profitability 

in addition some states have permitted us to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the pucs assess the prudency of such projects 

as a condition to our acquisition by rwe in 2003 we agreed not to file rate cases in some of the states where our regulated businesses operate as of december 31 2007 all rate stayout provisions associated with the rwe acquisition had expired 

in 2009 we received authorizations for additional annualized revenues from general rate cases including staged increases of 809 million we are awaiting the final order for our hawaii general rate case that was filed in 2007 requesting 13 million in total additional annual revenues in october 2008 the hawaii public utility commission approved on an interim basis an increase in additional annualized revenues of 07 million the interim rates were effective beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 also as of december 31 2009 we are awaiting final orders in eight other states for general rate cases filed in 2009 requesting additional annualized revenues of 2176 million there is no assurance that the filed amount or any portion thereof of any requested increases will be granted on february 26 2010 we filed a general rate case in kentucky requesting additional annualized revenue of 258 million

the water and wastewater utility industry is extremely capital intensive we invested approximately 785 million and 1 billion in net companyfunded capital improvements in 2009 and 2008 respectively for 2010 and the foreseeable future we anticipate spending between 800 million and 10 billion yearly on companyfunded capital investment depending upon the timing of major capital projects our capital investment includes 

  

both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace existing infrastructure as needed and construction of new facilities to meet customer growth as a percentage of the total capital investment we estimate our annual investment to replace aging infrastructure including mains meters and supply and treatment facilities will be approximately 40 we estimate that of the total capital investment in new facilities to serve customer growth and to comply with water quality standards and other regulatory requirements will be 20 and 15 respectively projects to enhance system reliability quality of service risk reduction as well as efficiency related and other projects are estimated to be approximately 25 of the total capital investment 

these capital investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations renew aging treatment and network assets provide capacity for new growth and enhance system reliability security and quality of service the need for continuous investment presents a challenge due to the potential for regulatory lag or the delay in recovering our operating expenses and earning an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital because the decisions of state pucs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses we maintain a rate case management program guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operation and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation as discussed above under “—economic utility regulation” we pursue methods to minimize the adverse impact of regulatory lag and continue to work with state pucs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result including promoting the implementation of forms of forwardlooking test years and infrastructure surcharges 

compliance with environmental health and safety standards 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include the safe drinking water act the clean water act the amendments to and reauthorizations of the clean water and safe drinking acts and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our regulated businesses are subject 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently and the overall trend has been that they have become more stringent over time we face the risk that as newer or stricter standards are introduced they could increase our operating expenses in the past we have generally been able to recover expenses associated with compliance related to environmental health and safety standards but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery 

production costs 

our water and wastewater services require significant production inputs which result in significant production costs these costs include fuel and power which is used to operate pumps and other equipment purchased water and chemicals used to treat water and wastewater we also incur production costs for waste disposal for 2009 production costs accounted for approximately 229 of our total operation and maintenance costs price increases associated with these inputs impact our results of operations until rate relief is granted 

customer growth 

customer growth in our regulated businesses is driven by i organic population growth within our authorized service areas and ii by adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water and wastewater utility systems generally we add customers through tuckins of small water andor wastewater 

  

systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers in close geographic proximity to areas where we currently operate our regulated businesses during 2009 2008 and 2007 we had cash outflows of 78 million 125 million and 159 million respectively for tuckin acquisitions of water and wastewater systems which allowed us to expand our regulated customer base we also seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing and new markets our experienced development team evaluates potential acquisition targets across the country before entering new regulated markets we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for quality reliability and compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality standards these acquisitions may include acquisitions of companies that have operations in multiple markets for further information see “business—growth” 

declining water usage per customer 

increased water conservation including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers combined with declining household sizes in the united states have contributed to a trend of declining water usage per residential customer additionally in the current economic environment both industrial and commercial usage continues to decline 

the average annual decrease in residential water usage per customer from january 2000 through december 2009 as a percentage of january 2000 usage in the larger states served by our regulated businesses ranged from a decline of 065 per year in new jersey at the low end to as high as 151 per year in arizona the decline in industrial and commercial usage from 2008 to 2009 was 76 

because the characteristics of residential water use are driven by many factors including socioeconomic and other demographic characteristics of our service areas climate seasonal weather patterns and water rates these declining trends vary by state and service area and change over time the trend of declining residential water usage per customer is higher in the predominantly rural states served by our regulated businesses we do not believe that the trend in any particular state or region will have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations 

our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon operating revenue generated from rates we charge to our customers for the volume of water they use declining usage due to conservation or economic environment contribute to regulatory lag and will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure appropriate regulatory treatment to offset the usage decline 

water supply 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water also customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions in particular during the warmer months our water systems experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income conversely when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies purchase supply allocations and mandatory conservation measures all of the above conditions serve to reduce customer demand and operating revenues these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands we employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm for additional detail concerning these measures see “business—our regulated businesses—overview of networks facilities and water supply” 

  

the geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of the effect of weather extremes in any given summer some areas are likely to experience drier than average weather while other areas will experience wetter than average weather 

goodwill impairment 

at december 31 2009 the company’s goodwill totaled 12504 million the company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values including goodwill on the measurement date if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

for the november 30 2009 impairment test the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques 

 

  

 the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the regulated reporting unit’s historic and forecasted cash flows the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers 

the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s fiveyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital 

because of the unique nature small size and lack of historical earnings of most of the nonregulated reporting units a market approach could not be reasonably applied as such the estimated fair values of the nonregulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models 

the company has completed its november 30 2009 annual impairment review and does not believe that the company’s goodwill balance was impaired the company’s fair value calculated in its 2009 impairment test period was approximately 6 above the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units 

  

however there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

in making the determination we considered both qualitative and quantitative factors including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the company’s market capitalization as such the company believes that the current evaluation technique is more appropriate than relying solely on the current trading market value of the company’s common stock 

we also made certain assumptions which we believe to be appropriate that support the fair value of our reporting units we considered in addition to the listed trading price of the company’s shares the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate as a result we concluded that the company’s fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone 

the difference between our calculated market capitalization which approximates carrying value and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulted from an estimated control premium the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling majority interest in the company in estimating the control premium management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace 

the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill in the amount of 4500 million in the first quarter of 2009 7500 million in the first quarter of 2008 2433 in third quarter of 2007 and 2660 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

   

the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated and nonregulated businesses for the periods indicated without giving effect to intersegment eliminations 

 

  

 our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide services to residential commercial and industrial customers as such our results of operations are impacted significantly by rates authorized by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate the table below details additional annual revenues including step increases and assuming a constant volume authorized by rate decisions and infrastructure charges filings which were granted in 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

  

     

the effective date for the 2009 pennsylvania rate increase was november 7 2009 the effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2008 were december 8 2008 november 28 2008 and august 8 2008 in new jersey missouri and illinois respectively the effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2007 were march 30 2007 november 30 2007 and october 22 2007 in new jersey pennsylvania and missouri respectively 

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

operating revenues our operating revenues increased by 1038 million or 44 to 24407 million for 2009 from 23369 million for 2008 regulated businesses’ revenues increased by 1246 million or 60 for 2009 compared to 2008 the nonregulated businesses’ revenues for 2009 decreased by 145 million or 53 from 2008 

the increase in the regulated businesses’ revenues was primarily due to incremental revenues of 1873 million resulting from rate increases obtained through general rate case as well as higher revenues resulting from surcharges and balancing accounts of 182 million additional revenues of 49 million were attributable to water and wastewater acquisitions most of which were in the later half of 2008 and fire service revenues increased by 53 million these increases were offset by an 936 million decrease in revenues related to lower customer consumption in a number of our operating companies mainly as a result of wet and cool weather in the midatlantic and midwestern regions of the united states as well as the downturn in the economy and conservation 

our nonregulated businesses’ operating revenues decreased by 145 million or 53 to 2577 million in 2009 from 2722 million for 2008 the net decrease was primarily attributable to lower revenues in our contract operations group and in our applied water management group partially offset by increased revenues in our homeowner services group the decrease in contract operations group revenues was primarily attributable to lower revenues associated with design and build contracts offset by increased military construction and om project revenues applied water management group revenues were lower than the prior year primarily due to the disposal of a pumping and hauling business in late 2008 in addition to the decline in design and build activity resulting from the downturn in new home construction the increase from our homeowner service group represented increased product penetration within its existing customer base and the addition of new mexico to our list of states where we offer our services 

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and water sales volume by customer class 

 

   

water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2009 increased 655 million or 55 from 2008 primarily due to rate increases offset by a decrease in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers decreased by 103 billion gallons or 48 from 2008 we attribute this decrease to wetter and cooler than normal weather conditions in a number of states in which we operate water conservation in general as well as the impact of california’s new conservation tariffs which were effective in 2009 and its severe water shortage due to legal restrictions imposed upon withdrawals from the sacramento delta and a longterm drought also contributed to the reduction 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2009 increased by 222 million or 55 mainly due to rate increases offset by decreases in sales volume compared to 2008 the volume of water sold to commercial customers decreased by 44 billion gallons or 49 from 2008 we attribute this decrease to the weather conditions as well as the downturn in the economy 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers for 2009 decreased 21 million or 20 from 2008 mainly due to decreased sales volume offset by rate increases the volume of water sold to industrial customers decreased 58 billion gallons or 138 from 2008 we attribute the decrease in the sales volumes to the current economic environment as customers reduce demand due to slowdown in their production process or the shutdown of production altogether in the case of some bankruptcies 

water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 163 million or 64 from 2008 mainly due to rate increases revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 1132 million for 2009 an increase of 88 million from 2008 revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2009 totaled 1588 million an increase of 75 million from 2008 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 12 states revenues from these services for 2009 increased by 98 million or 123 from 2008 the increase was attributable to increases in rates charged to customers in a number of our operating companies as well as higher revenues as a result of acquisitions of wastewater systems in pennsylvania and west virginia in the last six months of 2008 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 206 million or 16 for 2009 compared to 2008 

operation and maintenance expense for 2009 and 2008 by major expense category were as follows 

 

   

production costs increased by 147 million or 51 for 2009 compared to 2008 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 the decrease in fuel and power costs was primarily due to lower fuel prices in addition to the decreased water sales volumes partially offset by increased electric rates purchased water increased due to rate increases by our suppliers the increase in chemical costs is due to rising prices for those commodities compared to the same period in the prior year 

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and pension expense increased 347 million or 69 for 2009 compared to 2008 these employeerelated costs represented 408 and 388 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

 

 salaries and wages increased 58 million and 38 million in our regulated and nonregulated businesses respectively these increases primarily resulted from increased employee headcount as a result of enhancing customer service and merit wage rate increases partially offset by 43 million of wages related to job reclassification of certain hourly employees for services performed which was recorded in 2008 in addition to less expense for overtime worked in 2009 the increase in pension expense was primarily due to an increase in our regulated businesses’ pension expense of 117 million or 258 for 2009 over 2008 this increase is mainly attributable to an increase in the amortization of actuarial losses attributable to lower than expected returns on plan assets in 2008 as a result of the decline in the economic environment these market conditions are also the primary reason for the increase in costs for the other post employment benefits which are included in the group insurance amounts above medical benefit expenses which are included in group insurance for employees increased due to an increase in the number of employees and the rising cost of health care other benefits increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages which in turn resulted in increased company contribution to the 401k and defined contribution plans also other benefit expenses increased due to the benefit expense related to the new employee stock purchase plan 

  

operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation legal and other professional services as well as information systems and other office equipment rental charges for 2009 these costs decreased by 347 million or 123 compared to 2008 

 

 contracted services decreased in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in contracted services in our nonregulated businesses of 191 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of a decreased level of activity for our design build and operate project in fillmore california additionally consulting fees associated with our remediation efforts to comply with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 decreased 94 million the decrease in transportation costs is due to lower gasoline prices on average in 2009 as compared to 2008 other operating supplies and services decreased due to lower divestiture and initial public offering “ipo” related costs these costs totaled 19 million in 2009 compared to 124 million in 2008 offsetting these decreases were 2009 condemnation costs of 24 million the establishment of reserves for assets not recoverable at this time associated with the california rate case of 10 million an increase in business development costs of 10 million and 15 million of profits included in our nonregulated businesses’ expenses in 2008 as a result of the finalization and acceptance by the third party related to construction projects also included is an adjustment of 34 million attributable to previously capitalized costs 

maintenance materials and services which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance decreased 45 million or by 33 for 2009 compared to 2008 

 

 our regulated businesses’ maintenance materials and service costs decreased by 12 million in 2009 in addition to the lower removal costs the 2008 costs included 26 million associated with a program in illinois to maintain valves and fire hydrants offsetting these decreases were additional costs incurred by our arizona subsidiary attributable to a backbilling by the city of glendale arizona for our pro rata share of sewer line maintenance amounting to 10 million as well as increased tank painting costs of 07 million in one of our operating subsidiaries the nonregulated businesses’ maintenance and services expenses decreased by 33 million mainly due to decreased homeowner services maintenance services and supplies due to favorable claims experience 

  

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 38 million or 85 for 2009 compared to 2008 

 

 the increase was primarily the result of higher uncollectible accounts expense in our regulated businesses of 27 million due to an unusually low balance in 2008 as the result of a collection effort in the first quarter of 2008 to collect previously written off accounts our overall 2009 writeoff percentages and specific provisions for certain receivables including a number of commercial and industrial customers that have filed for bankruptcy increased in 2009 due the uncertainty of collectability which we believe is attributable to the current economic environment our nonregulated businesses’ uncollectible expense decreased by 16 million primarily as a result of the collection of accounts previously writtenoff the increase in the other category is mainly due to an increase in collection fees in our regulated businesses 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 66 million or 144 for 2009 compared to 2008 

 

 insurance expense increased due to less favorable claims experience in 2009 compared to 2008 in addition to higher general liability and property insurance premiums regulatory expenses increased in 2009 primarily as a result of a 35 million writeoff of rate case expenses as well as 13 million of ongoing rate case expenses associated with our california subsidiary costs incurred in connection with the rate case appeal in our tennessee subsidiary as well as increased amortization of costs related to final rate orders received in several states partially offsetting these increases were decreases associated with the writeoff of deferred rate case expenses in tennessee illinois and ohio in 2008 amounting to 32 million 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 230 million or 85 for 2009 compared to 2008 this increase was primarily due to additional assets placed in service mainly in our regulated businesses over the last year and a 24 million writeoff of certain software costs 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items remained relatively unchanged increasing by only 01 million or 01 in 2009 compared to 2008 

gain on sale of assets the gain on sale of assets was 08 million for 2009 compared to a gain of 04 million for 2008 the gains in 2009 and 2008 are primarily attributable to nonrecurring sales of assets no longer used in our operations 

  

impairment charge the impairment charge was 4500 million for 2009 compared to 7500 million for 2008 the 2009 amount recorded included an impairment charge to goodwill of our regulated businesses in the amount of 4482 million and our nonregulated businesses of 18 million the 2009 impairment charge which was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 was primarily related to the high degree of stock market volatility experienced and as of march 31 2009 the sustained period for which the company’s market price was below its carrying value the 2008 impairment charge was primarily due to the market price of the company’s common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than what was anticipated during our 2007 annual test also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company’s debt due to increased interest rates see “factors affecting our results of operations—goodwill impairment” 

other income deductions interest expense net of interest income the primary component of our other income deductions increased by 114 million or 40 for 2009 compared to 2008 the increase is primarily due to increased borrowings associated with capital expenditures in addition afudc decreased by 40 million in 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of certain key projects being placed inservice other items contributing to the change include lower miscellaneous income for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of the change in market value of investments held for certain employees’ elected deferred compensation 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 96 million or 86 to 1214 million for 2009 from 1118 million for 2008 the effective tax rates of 1087 and 248 for 2009 and 2008 respectively reflect the tax effects of the goodwill impairment charges as discrete items as the company considers these charges as infrequently occurring or unusual in addition to the tax benefits associated with the goodwill impairment charges 2009 included tax benefits attributable to the impact of tax law changes as well as other discrete items the company’s annual effective tax rate was 393  and 398  for 2009 and 2008 respectively excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charges and the various other discrete items 

net loss the net loss for 2009 was 2331 million compared to a net loss of 5624 million for 2008 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

operating revenues our operating revenues increased by 1227 million or 55 to 23369 million for 2008 from 22142 million for 2007 regulated businesses’ revenues increased by 952 million or 48 for 2008 compared to 2007 the nonregulated businesses’ revenues for 2008 increased by 295 million or 122 from 2007 

the increase in the regulated businesses’ revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through general rate cases totaling approximately 1328 million as well as higher revenues resulting from surcharges of 45 million and from customer growth and acquisitions of approximately 33 million this increase was offset by a 523 million decrease in revenues related to lower customer consumption mainly in our states in the midwestern region of the united states primarily due to the extremely wet weather conditions in those areas during 2008 as well as decreased usage in 2008 compared to 2007 in new jersey and pennsylvania mainly due to drier weather conditions in 2007 

our nonregulated businesses’ operating revenues increased by 295 million or 122 to 2722 million in 2008 from 2427 for 2007 the net increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues in our contract operations group and our homeowner services group partially offset by decreased revenues in our applied water management group and canadian fixed residuals the increase in contract operations group revenues was primarily attributable to incremental revenues associated with design and build contracts as well as increased military construction and om project revenues the increase from our homeowner service group 

  

represented increased product penetration within its existing customer base applied water management group revenues were lower than the prior year as a result of the decline in design and build activity resulting from the downturn in new home construction 

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and water sales volume by customer class 

 

 water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2008 increased 516 million or 45 from 2007 primarily due to rate increases offset by a decrease in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers decreased by 93 billion gallons or 42 from 2007 largely as a result of wetter weather conditions in california and the midwestern region of the united states in 2008 and drier weather conditions in new jersey and pennsylvania in 2007 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2008 increased by 183 million or 48 mainly due to rate increases offset by decreases in sales volume compared to 2007 the volume of water sold to commercial customers decreased by 31 billion gallons or 33 from 2007 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers for 2008 increased 70 million or 74 from 2007 mainly due to rate increases offset by decreased sales volume that we believe were caused by the downturn in the economy the volume of water sold to industrial customers decreased 26 billion gallons or 58 from 2007 

water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 81 million or 33 from 2007 mainly due to rate increases revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 1043 million for 2008 an increase of 50 million from 2007 revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2008 totaled 1513 million an increase of 31 million from 2007 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 12 states revenues from these services for 2008 increased by 43 million or 57 from 2007 the increase was attributable to increases in rates charged to customers principally in arizona new jersey and pennsylvania 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 573 million or 46 for 2008 compared to 2007 

  

operation and maintenance expense for the 2008 and 2007 by major expense category were as follows 

 

 production costs increased by 105 million or 38 for 2008 compared to 2007 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 the increase in fuel and power costs was primarily due to higher electricity prices purchased water costs were higher as a result of rate increases resulting from higher costs incurred by our suppliers the increase in chemical costs were attributable to rising prices as well as additional usage requirements related to fluctuating raw water quality caused by weather conditions in some of the states in which we operate 

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and pension expense increased 422 million or 91 for 2008 compared to 2007 these employeerelated costs represented 388 and 372 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

 during 2008 salaries and wages increased 237 million and 51 million in our regulated and nonregulated businesses respectively compared to the same period in the prior year these increases primarily resulted from stockbased compensation expense of 37 million mainly attributable to the issuance of awards granted in connection with the initial public offering 43 million of wages related to job reclassification of certain hourly employees for services performed and from an increase in the number of employees primarily as a result of enhancing customer service and inflationary wage rate increases the increase in pension expense was primarily due to an increase in our regulated businesses’ pension expense of 91 million or 251 for 2008 

  

over 2007 pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain of our regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates as contributions are made to the plans although our pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative guidance remained relatively unchanged pension expense increased for 2008 due to increased contributions by certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on the company’s funding policy which is to fund at least the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 which we refer to as erisa rather than the calculated expense under the guidance the increase in the contributions is attributable to a change in the discount rate and lower than expected returns on plan assets medical benefit expenses for employees increased due to an increase in the number of employees and the rising cost of health care other benefits increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages which in turn resulted in increased company contribution to the 401k and defined contribution plans also other benefit expenses increased due to the benefit expense related to the new employee stock purchase plan 

operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation legal and other professional services as well as information systems and other office equipment rental charges for 2008 these costs decreased by 102 million or 35 compared to 2007 

 

 contracted services increased in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 this increase was primarily due to higher contracted services in our contract operations group in 2008 as compared to 2007 associated with several operating contracts including a dbo project in fillmore california offsetting this increase were lower consulting fees associated with our remediation efforts to comply with sarbanesoxley act of 2002 these costs decreased by 226 million to 94 million in 2008 from 320 million in 2007 the increase in transportation costs is primarily the result of higher diesel and gasoline prices in 2008 other operating supplies and services were lower in 2008 as 2007 costs were higher due to a writeoff of certain deferred costs totaling 11 million by our new jersey subsidiary as they were no longer deemed recoverable additionally our nonregulated businesses recorded loss contingencies of 36 million in 2007 other decreases are associated with the cost of materials primarily related to our contract operations group due to changes in project work performed 

maintenance materials and services which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance increased 83 million or by 65 for 2008 compared to 2007 

 

 our regulated businesses’ maintenance materials and service costs increased by 68 million in 2008 mainly due to increased costs of 17 million associated with a program in illinois to maintain valves and fire 

  

hydrants and higher cost of removal expenses of 55 million in certain of our operating companies partially offset by lower paving costs of 14 million in our new jersey and missouri operating companies the nonregulated businesses’ maintenance and services expenses increased by 17 million as a result of higher frequency of claims primarily resulting from the increase in the number of customer contracts with the service line protection program in our homeowner services group as well as from increased costs associated with the contract operations group mainly due to costs associated with new military operations and maintenance projects 

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 58 million or 150 for 2008 compared to 2007 

 

 the increase was primarily the result of higher uncollectible accounts expense in our regulated businesses of 06 million and in our nonregulated businesses of 37 million primarily due to increased uncollectible expense in the applied water management group of 18 million primarily due to the collection of 12 million in 2007 for an amount that was previously writtenoff as well as higher uncollectible expense in our contract operation group in addition postage expense increased in our regulated subsidiaries 09 million compared to 2007 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 08 million or 18 for 2008 compared to 2007 

 

 insurance expense decreased due to more favorable claims experience in 2008 compared to 2007 regulatory expenses increased primarily due to writeoffs of deferred rate case expenses primarily in tennessee illinois california and ohio as well as increased rate case amortization costs associated with rate cases settled in 2007 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 39 million or 15 for 2008 compared to 2007 this increase was primarily due to additional assets placed in service mainly in our regulated businesses over the last year 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by 159 million or 87 in 2008 compared to 2007 this increase is primarily due to increased gross receipts taxes of 79 million primarily in new jersey and missouri and higher property tax expense of 42 million primarily in ohio and missouri additionally payroll taxes increased by 27 million due to increased salaries and wages and higher payroll tax limits 

gain on sale of assets the gain on sale of assets was 04 million for 2008 compared to a gain of 73 million for 2007 the gains in 2008 and 2007 are primarily attributable to nonrecurring sales of assets no longer used in our operations 

  

impairment charge the impairment charge was 7500 million for 2008 compared to 5093 million for 2007 the 2008 impairment charge was primarily due to the market price of the company’s common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than what was anticipated during our 2007 annual test also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company’s debt due to increased interest rates the 2007 impairment charge to goodwill to our regulated businesses was primarily due to slightly lower longterm earnings forecast caused by our updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery see “factors affecting our results of operations—goodwill impairment” 

other income deductions interest expense net of interest income the primary component of our other income deductions increased by 20 million or 07 for 2008 compared to 2007 the increase is primarily due to increased borrowings associated with capital expenditures offsetting the change in interest expense is an increase in afudc of 115 million for 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of increased construction activity in 2008 over 2007 amortization of debt expense increased 10 million for 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of debt restructuring other items contributing to the change include lower miscellaneous income for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result our indiana subsidiary now accounting for certain income in operating revenues in accordance with a 2007 rate order 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 250 million or 288 to 1118 million for 2008 from 868 million for 2007 

net income loss the net loss for 2008 was 5624 million compared to a net loss of 3428 million for 2007 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

liquidity and capital resources 

we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations commitments development activities and capital expenditures our business is very capital intensive and requires significant capital resources a portion of these capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations when necessary we obtain additional funds from external sources in the debt and capital markets and through bank borrowings our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets if these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms we have access to revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of 8500 million we rely on these revolving credit facilities and the capital markets to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and to back our commercial paper program disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets on september 15 2008 we sought to issue commercial paper but were unable to consummate the issuance due to adverse market conditions in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we borrowed under our then existing 850 million revolving credit facilities see “—credit facilities and shortterm debt” 

awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 506 million of outstanding letters of credit under its credit facilities as of december 31 2009 as of december 31 2009 awcc had 7994 million available under its credit facilities we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

in addition our regulated operating companies receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable 

  

are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines 

we use our capital resources including cash to i fund capital requirements including construction expenditures ii pay off maturing debt iii pay dividends iv fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and v invest in new and existing ventures we spend a significant amount of cash on construction projects that we expect to have a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag see “business—regulation—economic regulation” as a result of these factors our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a net deficit position as of december 31 2009 we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and cash flow from operations since we continue to make investments equal to or greater than our cash flows from operating activities we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

as of december 31 2008 the company had issued through its subsidiaries 1203 million of variable rate demand bonds which were periodically remarketed during the months of january and february 2009 awcc purchased these variable rate demand bonds because no investors were willing to purchase the bonds at acceptable market rates and held such bonds in treasury as a result of these repurchases in early 2009 and prior to the release of our 2008 10k the debt was reflected in current portion of longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2008 on may 21 2009 awcc remarketed 529 million of these variable rate demand notes as fixed rate tax exempt water facility revenue bonds with interest rates ranging from 600 to 675 the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay shortterm debt also on may 21 2009 awcc remarketed 319 million of the variable rate notes held in the company’s treasury and subsequently remarketed 233 million as fixed rate tax exempt water facility revenue bonds in the third quarter of 2009 the residual 86 million remains variable rate on the open market during the third quarter 2009 awcc successfully remarketed 249 million of the variable rate demand notes as fixed rate tax exempt water facility revenue bonds with an interest rate of 625 the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay shortterm debt the remaining 106 million is held in the company’s treasury at december 31 2009 we can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates 

on february 17 2009 the president signed the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of 2009 which we refer to as the act into law as a result of the act we have applied and will continue as long as available to apply for subsidized financing under the act in many of the states where we operate during 2009 we filed applications totaling 2883 million with state revolving loan fund agencies for either the act or other governmental subsidized funds to date we have been awarded 311 million as of february 25 2010 we have outstanding applications amounting to 234 million that can still be funded through one of these programs due to the demand for these funds we believe the likelihood of being awarded these funds is low also during 2009 the company issued 1799 million of new taxexempt rate private activity bonds the interest on which as a result of this act is not subject to the alternative minimum tax also in connection with the act the company has reflected the tax benefits from the extension of bonus depreciation in its 2009 results 

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of demand are weighted toward the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation infrastructure investment inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining per customer usage of water and weather and seasonality see “—factors affecting our results of operations” 

  

cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable steady source of funding sufficient to meet operating requirements our dividend payments and a portion of our capital expenditures requirements we will seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements as needed there can be no assurance that we will be able to access such markets successfully on favorable terms or at all operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulatory environments or changes in our customer economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated 

 

  

  the increase in cash flows from operations during 2009 compared to 2008 was primarily due to increased revenues offset by changes in working capital mainly driven by changes in taxes receivable and taxes accrued the change in taxes is primarily due to the fact that a 350 million tax refund including interest was received in december 2008 no similar amount was received at the end of 2009 

in december 2008 the company filed a request with the internal revenue service irs to change its tax accounting method for repair and maintenance cost on its utility assets the irs partially approved the request in october 2009 with the company receiving final approval in february 2010 as a result of this change we expect to receive cash refunds of approximately 431 million including a carryback claim for alternative minimum tax of 252 million which will be filed for in 2010 

the increase in cash flows from operations during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased revenues partially offset by higher contributions to our pension and postretirement healthcare trusts 

the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1199 million in 2010 of which 226 was already made in february 2010 in addition we currently estimate that contributions will amount to 1479 million in 2011 1558 million in 2012 1238 in 2013 and 1188 million in 2014 actual amounts contributed could change materially from these estimates 

the increase in the 2009 contributions was the result of the company’s 2008 unfunded status of its pension plan which increased significantly primarily due to lower than expected 2008 asset returns based on the then current plan assets and expected future asset returns the company estimated in early 2009 the increase to pension and postretirement expense net of capitalized amounts in 2009 to be approximately 32 million 

  

pretax during 2009 the company had discussions with the majority of our regulators about the appropriate treatment for these incremental costs in order to minimize regulatory lag between incurring the expense and any recovery of the expense as a result of these discussions we have authorization to recover or defer 106 million of this annual increase and have requested permission to recover or defer as a deferred asset until the next rate case is concluded an additional 65 million of this increase in 2009 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows for the periods indicated 

 

  

 cash flows used in investing activities decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 mainly due to a decrease in capital expenditures which was primarily attributable to our decision as a result of the 2008 credit market disruptions to decrease in 2009 our investment in our regulated utility plant projects cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2008 compared to 2007 as we continued to increase our investment in regulated infrastructure projects in 2010 we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 800 million and 1 billion we intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base while working with regulators in the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment 

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

during 2008 as part of the strategy to improve operational efficiencies we began to evaluate our processes including information systems associated with those processes to optimize workflow throughout our field operations improve our backoffice operations and enhance our customer service our information systems which support many of our processes are at the end of their useful life our existing systems are increasingly costly and more difficult to maintain and support since our existing vendors have issued newer versions that are not compatible with our current systems in addition customer expectations for service are far greater today than existed when our current systems were implemented the lack of sufficient automation limits opportunities for our customers to conduct basic selfservice tasks or for our employees to service customers effectively by obtaining appropriate information quickly and consistently from across multiple nonintegrated systems 

during 2009 we embarked on a study in order to assess existing internal capabilities to satisfy customer and other stakeholder expectations the study also included a review of currently offered technology options which could enhance and automate processes as appropriate to improve customer service and more efficiently comply with regulatory requirements the evaluation was designed to identify the investments necessary to replace upgrade enhance andor redesign specific business processes and applicable system components based on the work performed to date we have decided to undertake a business transformation initiative “bt” to enhance processes and upgrade antiquated systems in order to generate efficiencies and provide more cost effective service to our customers 

  

during the first quarter of 2010 we expect to complete the evaluation of appropriate software solutions begin the process of selecting suitable software applications and a systems integrator develop a strategy to transfer existing data to new system applications as well as start the system analysis design and roadmap also in late 2010 we expect configuration of the system applications to begin 

current estimates indicate that bt expenditures could total as much as 280 million and span a period of approximately five years expenditures associated with bt are included in the 800 million to 10 billion capital investment spending outlined above as with any other initiative of this magnitude there are risks that could result in increased costs any technical difficulties such as consolidating our current systems or other difficulties in developing or implementing this initiative such as implementing a successful change management process may result in delays which in turn may increase the costs of the project and also delay any cost savings and efficiencies expected to result from the initiative when we make adjustments to our operations we may incur incremental expenses prior to realizing the benefits of a more efficient workforce and operating structure while we anticipate recovery of expenditures through regulated rates we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to achieve timely or adequate rate recovery of these increased costs associated with this transformation project any such delays or difficulties may have a material and adverse impact on our business customer relationships and financial results we believe that the goals of bt—increasing our operating efficiency and effectiveness and controlling the costs associated with the operation of our business—are important to providing the quality service to our customers and communities we serve as well as to our longterm competitiveness 

the following table provides a summary of our historical capital expenditures 

 

 capital expenditures during the periods noted above were related to the renewal of supply and treatment assets new water mains and customer service lines as well as rehabilitation of existing water mains and hydrants 

capital expenditures for 2009 decreased by 2235 million or 222 from 10088 million in 2008 as a result of our 2009 decision to address the credit market disruptions construction expenditures for 2008 increased by 2580 million or 344 over 2007 

expenditures related to transmission and distribution increased by 1035 million in 2008 over 2007 and meter and fire hydrant replacements increased by 442 million in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases occurred due to an increase in the rate of infrastructure replacement treatment and pumping expenditures increased by 197 million in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of significant treatment improvements in a number of states in which we operate including kentucky illinois and arizona 

on april 25 2008 the kentucky public service commission approved kentuckyamerican water company’s application for a certificate of convenience and necessity to construct a 200 million gallon per day treatment plant on the kentucky river and a 306 mile pipeline to meet central kentucky’s water supply deficit the kentucky project is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 with an estimated cost of 162 million 

  

our construction program consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth and water quality regulations an integral aspect of our strategy is to seek growth through tuckins and other acquisitions which are complementary to our existing business and support the continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt or equity offerings 

we also conduct ongoing reviews of our existing investments as a result of these reviews we sold the operations of various nonregulated waterrelated businesses during 2007 the following provides a summary of the major acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities in the years indicated 

2009 

 

 2008 

 

  

 2007 

 

  

  

 during 2007 njawc entered into an agreement with the city to purchase the assets of the city’s outside water system located in four surrounding townships the initial proposed purchase price of 100 million was subsequently amended to 75 million plus the provision of technical services by the city over seven years at a total cost to njawc of 50 million to ensure a smooth ownership transition the amended agreement also requires njawc to purchase finished water from the city for a period of 20 years after closing under a water supply agreement 

since february 2009 a small group of petitioners has been involved in litigation with the city and njawc seeking to force the sale to a referendum on december 19 2009 the new jersey superior court appellate panel published its decision unanimously upholding a march 2009 trial court decision in favor of the city the supreme court has granted the petitioners’ request for certification and oral argument is scheduled before the supreme court on march 22 2010 the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the litigation the acquisition is expected to add approximately 40000 customers to njawc’s customer base 

  

our investing activities could require considerable capital resources which we have generated through operations and attained through financing activities we can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities whose primary purpose is to fund construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through awcc we intend to access the capital markets on a regular basis subject to market conditions in addition new infrastructure may be funded with customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds this amounted to 212 million 31 million and 358 million for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

on may 1 2009 we and awcc filed a universal shelf registration statement that enabled us to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities including common stock preferred stock and debt securities all subject to market demand and ratings status on june 10 2009 the company completed a public offering of 299 million shares of its common stock pursuant to the offering the company sold 145 million shares of common stock and 154 million shares were sold by selling stockholder rwe 

the company completed the sale of 145 million shares of common stock at 1725 per share the proceeds from the offering net of underwriters’ discounts and expenses payable by the company were 2423 million the proceeds from the offering were used to repay shortterm debt 

at the same time rwe completed a partial divestiture of its investment in the company through the sale of 115 million shares also at a price of 1725 rwe granted the underwriters a 30day option to purchase up to an additional 39 million shares of the company’s stock at a price of 1725 the underwriters exercised their option and purchased 39 million shares to cover overallotments the company did not receive any proceeds from the rwe sale of the company’s shares prior to the sale of these shares by rwe and the company rwe owned approximately 60 of the company’s common shares after the sales of shares and exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option rwe owned approximately 47 of the company’s shares 

during the remainder of 2009 rwe continued to divest of its remaining investment in the company through the sale of additional shares in august 2009 rwe sold 403 million shares including 53 million shares to cover the overallotments at a price of 1925 in november 2009 rwe sold 411 million shares which included 37 million shares to cover the overallotments at a price of 2163 we did not receive any proceeds from the rwe sales of the company’s shares as a result of the full exercise of the underwriter’s option in november 2009 rwe became fully divested of our common stock

the following debt and preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements were retired through extinguishments optional redemption or payment at maturity in 2007 

 

 from time to time and as market conditions warrant we may engage in longterm debt retirements via tender offers open market repurchases or other viable alternatives to strengthen our balance sheets 

  

credit facilities and shortterm debt 

the components of shortterm debt were as follows 

 

 awcc has entered into a 100 million committed revolving line of credit with pnc bank na which was scheduled to terminate on december 31 2009 on december 15 2009 this line of credit was extended for an additional year and will terminate on december 31 2010 unless extended this line is used primarily for shortterm working capital needs interest rates on advances under this line of credit are based on either the prime rate of pnc bank na or the applicable libor for the term selected plus 200 basis points for 2009 and 175 basis points for 2010 in addition there is a fee of 25 basis points charged quarterly on the portion of the commitment that is undrawn as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 there were no outstanding borrowings under this revolving line of credit if this line of credit were not extended beyond its current maturity date of december 31 2010 awcc would continue to have access to its 8400 million unsecured revolving credit facility described below 

awcc our finance subsidiary has entered into an 840 million senior unsecured credit facility syndicated among the following group of 11 banks with jpmorgan chase bank na acting as administrative agent 

 

 this revolving credit facility which was originally scheduled to terminate on september 15 2011 is principally used to support the commercial paper program at awcc and to provide up to 1500 million in letters of credit on september 14 2007 this revolving credit facility was extended for an additional year by the facility bank group making the new termination date september 15 2012 on september 15 2008 a majority of the banks agreed to further extend 6850 million of commitments under this revolving credit facility to september 15 2013 on december 18 2008 the bank of new york mellon joined the credit facility syndicate with a commitment amount of 400 million through september 15 2012 if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances the company may request the other lenders to assume the defaulting lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment however the 

  

remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender’s commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to replace a defaulting lender awcc had no outstanding borrowings and 482 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 24 2010 also as of february 24 2010 awcc had 589 million of commercial paper outstanding 

on december 31 2009 and 2008 awcc had the following sublimits and available capacity under the revolving credit facility and indicated amounts of outstanding commercial paper 

 

 interest rates on advances under the revolving credit facility are based on either prime or libor plus an applicable margin based upon our credit ratings as well as total outstanding amounts under the agreement at the time of the borrowing the maximum libor margin is 55 basis points 

the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 was approximately 082 and 351 respectively 

capital structure 

our capital structure was as follows 

 

 the changes to our capital resource mix during 2008 and 2007 were accomplished through the various financing activities noted above in “cash from financing activities” the capital structure at december 31 2009 more closely reflects our expected future capital structure 

as a condition to some puc approvals of the rwe divestiture we agreed to maintain a capital structure with a minimum of 45 common equity at the time of the consummation of our initial public offering on april 28 2008 as a result of the impairment charge recorded for the three months ended march 31 2008 our capital structure did not meet this minimum requirement and we received a cash equity contribution from rwe of 2450 million on may 1 2008 this cash was used to repay 2434 million of shortterm debt following the initial public offering rwe was not obligated to make any additional capital contributions contributions from rwe were 10671 million for the year ended december 31 2007 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue debt or access our 

  

revolving credit lines we were in compliance with our covenants as of december 31 2009 see “risk factors—risks related to our industry and business—our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger repayment obligations” longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things limit subject to certain exceptions the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets 

the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2009 our ratio was 058 and therefore we were in compliance with the ratio 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and respective financing costs in those markets depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets we primarily access the capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we do issue debt at our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities to lower our overall cost of debt the following table shows the company’s securities ratings as of december 31 2009 

 

 on december 21 2009  standard  poor’s ratings services which we refer to as sp affirmed its “bbb” corporate credit rating on awcc and american water and affirmed awcc’s “a2” shortterm rating sp’s rating outlook for both american water and awcc is stable 

on november 20 2009 moody’s investors service which we refer to as moody’s affirmed its “baa2” corporate credit rating on awcc and american water and affirmed awcc’s “p2” shortterm rating the rating outlook for both american water and awcc is stable 

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flow is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facilities 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy fuels and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance depending on the company’s net position with a counterparty the demand could be for the posting of collateral in the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided the obligation to supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the company’s situation at the time of the demand if we can reasonably claim that we are willing and financially able to perform our obligations it may be possible to argue successfully that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future payments should be sufficient we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operation financial position or cash flows 

  

dividends 

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends rather than retaining that cash for other purposes generally our policy is to distribute 50 to 70 of our net income annually we expect that dividends will be paid every march june september and december of each fiscal year to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock will not be cumulative only declared dividends will be paid 

during 2009 and 2008 we paid 1373 million and 641 million in dividends respectively for 2009 we paid a dividend of 021 per share on december 1 2009 and september 1 2009 and 020 per share on june 1 2009 and march 2 2009 for 2008 we paid a dividend of 020 per share on september 2 2008 and december 1 2008 there were no common dividend payments made for 2007 

subject to applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors we will pay cash dividends of approximately 021 per share per quarter in 2010 to be paid approximately 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter the quarterly and annual average aggregate dividend amounts for the four quarters would be 367 million and 1467 million annually the aggregate dividend amounts are based upon 1747 million shares outstanding as of february 25 2010 under delaware law our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our “surplus” which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities minus statutory capital or if there is no surplus out of our net profits for the then current andor immediately preceding fiscal year although we believe we will have sufficient net profits or surplus to pay dividends at the anticipated levels during the next four quarters our board of directors will seek periodically to assure itself of this before actually declaring any dividends in future periods our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient to allow payment of dividends and such opinions may not be forthcoming if we sought and were not able to obtain such an opinion we likely would not be able to pay dividends 

on january 29 2010 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 021 per share payable on march 1 2010 to all shareholders of record as of february 18 2010 

current credit market position 

the company believes it has sufficient liquidity should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets the company funds liquidity needs for capital investment working capital and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations public and private debt offerings commercial paper markets and credit facilities with 8500 million in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of banks as of february 24 2010 we had 8018 million available to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs to issue letters of credit and back our 589 million outstanding commercial paper as of february 24 2010 the company can issue additional commercial paper of 6411 million which is backed by the credit facilities the 2008 market disruptions caused the company to redeem its tax exempt bonds in variable rate structures and remarket as fixed rate securities the company closely monitors the financial condition of the financial institutions associated with its credit facilities 

at this time the company does not believe recent market disruptions will impact its longterm ability to obtain financing the company expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets on favorable terms before the maturity dates of its current credit facilities and the company does not expect a significant number of its lenders to default on their commitments thereunder in addition the company can delay major capital investments or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

  

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt or equity securities at most of our regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that these companies can distribute to us 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover unanticipated losses or claims we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business these financial obligations as of december 31 2009 are set forth in the table below 

 

 note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our nonregulated businesses are not included in the above amounts 

 

     

      publicprivate partnerships 

west virginia american water company which we refer to as wvawc has entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships the wvawc constructed utility plant financed by the wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to the wvawc’s property financed by the partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds commonly referred to as idbs issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

wvawc leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities was approximately 1603 million at december 31 2009 

nonregulated businesses performance obligations 

our nonregulated businesses contract operations group enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2051 and 2060 and have remaining performance of 20970 million at december 31 2009 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2010 and 2048 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 13050 million at december 31 2009 some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

our financial condition results of operations and cash flow are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and 

  

assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we account for these regulated operations in accordance with authoritative guidance that requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements use of the authoritative guidance is applicable to utility operations that meet the following criteria 1 thirdparty regulation of rates 2 costbased rates and 3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates as of december 31 2009 we had concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of the businesses no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of the authoritative guidance could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as a onetime extraordinary item and continued impacts on our operating activities 

regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow for recovery through rates charged to customers regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred as of december 31 2009 we have recorded 9520 million of net regulatory assets within our consolidated financial statements also at december 31 2009 we had recorded 3223 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets and liabilities 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates 

goodwill 

the company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan at december 31 2009 the company’s goodwill was 12504 million the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values including goodwill on the measurement date if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the 

  

carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

for the november 30 2009 impairment test the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques 

 

  

 the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the regulated reporting unit’s historic and forecasted cash flows the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers 

the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s fiveyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital 

because of the unique nature small size and lack of historical earnings of most of the nonregulated reporting units a market approach could not be reasonably applied as such the estimated fair values of the nonregulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models 

the company has completed its november 30 2009 annual impairment review and does not believe that the company’s goodwill balance was impaired the company’s fair value calculated in its 2009 impairment test period was approximately 6 above the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units 

however there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge 

we also made certain assumptions which we believe to be appropriate that support the fair value of our reporting units we considered in addition to the listed trading price of the company’s shares the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate as a result we concluded that the company’s fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone 

the difference between our calculated market capitalization which approximates carrying value and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units resulted from an estimated control premium the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling majority interest in the company in estimating the control premium management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace 

for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill in the amount of 4500 million 7500 million and 5093 million respectively 

  

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill which is discussed above include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period unbilled revenues as of december 31 2009 and 2008 were 1303 million and 1342 million respectively increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and favorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue however since the majority of our customers are billed on a monthly basis total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged 

revenue from nonregulated operations is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

  

accounting for income taxes 

the parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for united states tax purposes members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns 

certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes the company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements these deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse in addition the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences previously flowed through to customers reverse 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations the pension plans have been closed for any employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2006 will be provided with a 525 of base pay defined contribution plan we also maintain postretirement benefit plans for eligible retirees the retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs are developed from actuarial valuations inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided by the company to its actuaries including the discount rate and expected longterm rate of return on plan assets material changes in the company’s pension and postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

 

  

  

  

 the discount rate is subject to change each year consistent with changes in applicable highquality longterm corporate bond indices in selecting a discount rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans a yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 593 612 and 627 at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 582 609 and 620 at december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets which we refer to as eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 790 for 2009 and 2008 and 800 for 2007 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 760 for 2009 775 for 2008 and 738 for 2007 

the asset allocation for the company’s us pension plan at december 31 2009 and 2008 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocation for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2009 and 2008 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held directly and through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and post retirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 872 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date the remaining 128 of the assets are valued using other observable inputs 

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 400 for 2009 and 2008 and 425 for 2007 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 800 in 2009 gradually declining to 500 in 2015 and thereafter 

  

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 

 we will use a discount rate and eroa of 593 and 790 respectively for estimating our 2010 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and eroa of 582 and 760 respectively for estimating our 2010 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increase our pension expense our 2009 and 2008 pension and postretirement costs were 726 million and 514 million respectively the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1199 million 1479 million 1558 million 1238 million and 1188 million in 2010 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates 

the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

recent accounting pronouncements 

fair value measurements 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued authoritative guidance that requires new disclosures of i the amounts of significant transfers into and out of level 1 and level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for those transfers and ii information in the reconciliation of recurring level 3 measurements those using significant unobservable inputs about purchases sales issuances and settlements on a gross basis this update also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for the requirement to disclose information about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the reconciliation of level 3 measurements which does not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2010 as this guidance clarifies and provides for additional disclosure requirements only the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows

our history as a public company 

the company was founded in 1886 as the american water works  guarantee company for the purposes of building and purchasing water systems in mckeesport pennsylvania in 1935 the company was reorganized under its current name and in 1947 the common stock of the company became publicly traded on the nyse prior to being acquired by rwe aktiengesellschaft which we refer to as rwe a stock corporation incorporated in the federal republic of germany in 2003 we were the largest publicly traded water utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served in the united states 

our acquisition by rwe 

in 2003 we were acquired by rwe and were no longer a publicly traded company the rwe acquisition resulted in certain changes in our business for example our operations and management were managed through thames water plc a former subsidiary of rwe which we refer to as thames water also we agreed not to file rate cases with certain state commissions or other entities engaged in economic regulation of our subsidiaries which we refer to as pucs for specified periods of time as a condition of the acquisition all rate stayout provisions associated with the rwe acquisition have expired on september 28 2007 thames water aqua us holdings inc which we refer to as thames us holdings at the time an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe was merged with and into american water with american water being the surviving entity which we refer to as the merger in 2005 rwe decided to divest american water and in march 2006 decided to effect the divestiture through the sale of shares in one or more public offerings 

our initial public offering 

upon the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008 we again became listed on the nyse under the symbol “awk” and resumed our position as the largest publicly traded water utility company in the united states 

  

regulated businesses overview 

our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial and industrial customers our subsidiaries that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by the state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters we report the results of this business in our regulated businesses segment 

the following charts set forth operating revenue for 2008 and customers as of december 31 2008 respectively for the states in which our regulated businesses provide services 

 

 

nonregulated businesses overview 

we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs through our nonregulated businesses our nonregulated businesses include 

 

  

  

  

 we report the results of these lines of business in our nonregulated businesses segment for 2008 operating revenue for our nonregulated businesses was 2722 million prior to intersegment eliminations 

  

accounting for 116 of total operating revenue for the same period nonregulated business operating revenues were 2427 million for 2007 and 2485 million for 2006 accounting for 110 and 119 respectively of total operating revenues for the same periods 

our industry 

overview 

the united states water and wastewater industry has two main segments i utility which involves supplying water and wastewater services to consumers and ii general services which involves providing water and wastewaterrelated services to water and wastewater utilities and other customers on a contract basis 

the utility segment includes municipal systems which are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions and investorowned systems the environmental protection agency “epa” estimates that governmentowned systems make up the vast majority of the united states water and wastewater utility segment accounting for approximately 84 of all united states community water systems and approximately 98 of all united states community wastewater systems investorowned water and wastewater systems account for the remainder of the united states water and wastewater community water systems growth of service providers in the utility segment is achieved through acquisitions including small water and wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers in close geographic proximity to where we currently operate our regulated business which we refer to as “tuckins” of other water and wastewater systems and organic growth of the population served by such providers 

the utility segment is characterized by high barriers to entry including high capital spending requirements investorowned water and wastewater utilities also face regulatory approval processes in order to do business which may involve obtaining relevant operating approvals including certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations from state pucs investorowned water and wastewater systems are generally economically regulated by the state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters for both investorowned and governmentowned water and wastewater utilities 

the general services segment includes engineering and consulting companies and numerous other feeforservice businesses these include the building and operating of water and wastewater utility systems system repair services lab services sale of water infrastructure and distribution products such as pipes and other specialized services the general services segment is characterized by aggressive competition and marketdriven growth and profit margins 

the aging water and wastewater infrastructure in the united states is in constant need of modernization and facilities replacement increased regulations to improve water quality and the management of wastewater discharges which began with passage of the clean water act in 1972 and the safe drinking water act in 1974 have been among the primary drivers of the need for modernization the epa estimates that approximately 277 billion of capital spending will be necessary between 2003 and 2022 to replace aging infrastructure and to comply with quality standards to ensure quality water systems across the united states in addition the epa estimates that approximately 388 billion of capital spending will be necessary between 2000 and 2019 to replace aging infrastructure and ensure quality wastewater systems across the united states 

  

the following chart sets forth estimated capital expenditure needs from 2003 through 2022 for united states water systems 

capital expenditures related to municipal water supply treatment and distribution and wastewater collection and treatment facilities are typically funded by water and wastewater rates taxes or the issuance of bonds however raising large amounts of funds is challenging for municipal water utilities which impacts their ability to increase capital spending in order to meet their capital spending challenges many municipalities are examining a combination of privatizations and partnerships with the private sector privatization involves a transfer of responsibility for and ownership of the utility from the municipality to the private sector partnerships between municipalities and the private sector include dbo contracts own operate and transfer contracts and own leaseback and operate contracts under these types of contracts the municipality maintains ownership of the water andor wastewater system and the private sector takes responsibility for managing and operating the system 

over the next five years we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 40 and 45 billion our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace existing infrastructure as needed and construction of facilities to meet new customer growth over the next five years we estimate we will invest approximately 13 to 14 billion to replace aging infrastructure including mains meters and supply and treatment facilities we estimate that we will invest approximately 12 to 13 billion in facilities to serve new customer growth over the same period in addition we estimate that complying with water quality standards and other regulatory requirements will require approximately 300 to 400 million of investment we estimate that projects to enhance system reliability quality of service and risk reduction will require an investment of approximately 800 million while efficiency related projects will require an investment of 400 to 600 million 

  

the charts below set forth our estimated percentage of projected capital expenditures for 2009 to 2013 by purpose of investment and by asset type respectively 

fragmentation and consolidation 

the utility segment of the united states water and wastewater industry is highly fragmented with approximately 52000 community water systems and approximately 16000 community wastewater facilities according to the epa as shown in the charts below the majority of the approximately 52000 community water systems are very small serving a population of 500 or less 

the following charts set forth the total united states water industry by system type and the total population served by system type respectively for 2008 water statistics 

 

 

this large number of relatively small water and wastewater utilities results in inefficiencies in the marketplace since smaller utilities may not have the operating expertise financial and technological capability or economies of scale to provide services or raise capital as efficiently as larger utilities these inefficiencies may 

  

lead to industry consolidation in the future as the larger investorowned utilities acquire smaller local water and wastewater systems larger utilities that have greater access to capital are generally more capable of making mandated and other necessary infrastructure upgrades to both water and wastewater systems in addition water and wastewater utilities with large customer bases spread across broad geographic regions may more easily absorb the impact of adverse weather such as droughts excessive rain and cool temperatures in specific areas larger utilities are able to spread overhead expenses over a larger customer base thereby reducing the costs to serve each customer since many administrative and support activities can be efficiently centralized to gain economies of scale and sharing of best practices companies that participate in industry consolidation have the potential to improve operating efficiencies lower unit costs and improve service at the same time 

water and wastewater rates 

investorowned water and wastewater utilities generate operating revenue from customers based on rates that are established by state pucs through a ratesetting process that may include public hearings evidentiary hearings and the submission by the utility of evidence and testimony in support of the requested level of rates in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on five areas i the amount and prudence of investment in facilities considered “used and useful” in providing public service ii the operating and maintenance costs and taxes associated with providing the service typically by making reference to a representative 12month period of time known as a test year iii the appropriate rate of return iv the tariff or rate design that allocates operating revenue requirements equitably across the customer base and v the quality of service the utility provides including issues raised by customers 

for most consumers water and wastewater bills make up a relatively small percentage of household expenditures compared to other utility services 

the following chart sets forth the relative cost of water in the united states as a percentage of total household utility expenditures 

our regulated businesses 

our core regulated businesses which consist of locally managed utility subsidiaries that generally are economically regulated by the states in which they operate accounted for approximately 891 of our consolidated operating revenue in 2008 our regulated businesses provide a high degree of financial stability because i high barriers to entry provide limited protection from competitive pressures ii economic regulation promotes predictability in financial planning and longterm performance through the ratesetting process and iii our largely residential customer base promotes consistent operating results 

  

overview of networks facilities and water supply 

our regulated businesses operate in approximately 1600 communities in 20 states in the united states our primary operating assets include approximately 80 surface water treatment plants 600 groundwater treatment plants 1100 groundwater wells 50 wastewater treatment facilities 1100 treated water storage facilities 1200 pumping stations and 100 dams and 48000 miles of mains and collection pipes we own substantially all of the assets used by our regulated businesses 

we generally own the land and physical assets used to store extract and treat source water typically we do not own the water itself which is held in public trust and is allocated to us through contracts and allocation rights granted by federal and state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law sources of supply are seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply in connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources we employ sophisticated models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions surface and groundwater levels are routinely monitored for all supplies so that supply capacity may be predicted and as needed mitigated through demand management and additional supply development 

the following chart sets forth the sources of water supply for our regulated businesses for 2008 by volume 

the level of water treatment that we apply varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source surface water sources such as rivers typically require significant filtration while some groundwater sources such as aquifers require chemical treatment only in addition a small amount of treated water is purchased from neighboring water purveyors treated water is transported through an extensive transmission and distribution network which includes underground pipes above ground storage facilities and numerous pumping facilities with the ultimate distribution of the treated water to the customers’ premises we also have installed meters to measure the water that we deliver through our distribution network we employ a variety of methods of meter reading to monitor consumption ranging from basic mechanical meters read by traveling meter readers to remote “driveby” electronic meter reading equipment the majority of new meters are able to support future advances in electronic meter reading 

the provision of wastewater services involves the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines the wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility where it is treated to meet required effluent standards the treated wastewater is finally returned to the environment as effluent and the solid waste byproduct of the treatment process is disposed of in accordance with local standards 

maintaining the reliability of our networks is a key activity of our regulated businesses we have ongoing main renewal programs in all states in which our regulated businesses operate these programs consist of both 

  

rehabilitation of existing mains and replacement of mains that have reached the end of their useful service life the decision of whether to replace or rehabilitate our mains is subject to considerations of cost feasibility and customer service impact 

the following table sets forth operating revenue for 2008 and number of customers as of december 31 2008 for our regulated subsidiaries in the states where our regulated businesses provide services 

 

  

 approximately 833 of operating revenue from our regulated businesses in 2008 was generated from approximately 27 million customers in our seven largest states as measured by operating revenues in fiscal year 2008 no single customer accounted for more than 1 of our annual operating revenue 

the operational characteristics of our regulated businesses including water and wastewater networks and infrastructure and water sources and supply vary on a statebystate basis as explained below with respect to our top seven states by regulated businesses revenues 

new jersey 

new jerseyamerican water company inc which we refer to as njawc serves a population of approximately 25 million njawc combined with our applied wastewater management inc which we refer to as awwm also regulated in new jersey generated approximately 5177 million of operating revenue in 2008 representing approximately 249 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period 

in new jersey our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including streams lakes and reservoirs and groundwater sources in 2008 we obtained 65 of our water supply from surface water sources and 30 from groundwater sources purchased water accounted for 5 of water supply respectively for the same period 

njawc currently operates seven surface water treatment plants and approximately 150 groundwater treatment plants which process water extracted from more than 170 groundwater wells we maintain approximately 150 treated water storage facilities 140 pumping stations and seven dams and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 8900 miles of mains and collection pipes both awwm and njawc currently provide wastewater treatment services to small communities in new jersey 

in new jersey in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we utilize reservoirs aquifer storage supplies and seasonal wells to provide for water needs during peak summer seasons through the 

  

optimization of ground and surface water rights we are able to balance seasonal fluctuations and provide sufficient water supply to our customers year round we also maintain drought and emergency plans to minimize the impact on service through a wide range of weather fluctuations 

during 2007 njawc entered into an agreement with the city of trenton new jersey to purchase the assets of the city’s water system located in four surrounding communities the agreement required approval from the new jersey puc the initial proposed purchase price of 1000 million was subsequently amended to 750 million in addition the agreement has been amended to include the provision of technical services from the city over seven years to ensure a smooth transition of ownership at a total cost of 50 million the administrative law judge hearing the matter has issued an initial decision the “initial decision” approving a stipulation of settlement reflecting the changed agreement the “stipulation” and sent the initial decision to the new jersey puc for consideration on february 25 2009 a petition seeking a referendum was filed with the city of trenton the petition seeks to force the city council to reconsider its prior approval of sale and a vote as to whether the ordinance approving the sale of the system should go forward or be negated the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the referendum nor can we provide assurance that the initial decision will ultimately be approved by the new jersey puc included in the stipulation and dependent upon final approval the company intends to purchase finished water from the city of trenton for the next 20 years under a water supply agreement the acquisition is expected to add approximately 40000 customers to the company’s customer base 

pennsylvania 

pennsylvaniaamerican water company which we refer to as pawc serves a population of approximately 2 million and generated approximately 4479 million of operating revenue in 2008 representing approximately 215 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period 

in pennsylvania our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including streams lakes and reservoirs and groundwater sources in 2008 we obtained 92 of our water supply from surface water sources and 7 from groundwater sources purchased water accounted for 1 of our water supply for the same period 

pawc currently operates approximately 35 surface water treatment plants and 70 groundwater treatment plants which process water extracted from over 100 groundwater wells we maintain approximately 250 treated water storage facilities 280 pumping stations and 60 dams and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 9900 miles of mains and collection pipes we currently operate seven wastewater treatment facilities in pennsylvania 

in pennsylvania in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we maintain active drought contingency plans in each of our public water systems the plans identify the source of supply operations that are used during normal and drought weather conditions and specify measures to be taken at different drought trigger levels to increase supply andor curtail water demand water allocation and passingflow requirements must be managed to maintain adequate supply to our production facilities in addition we have taken action to augment supply in systems that have historically had droughtrelated supply issues such as butler pennsylvania by finding alternative raw water sources and making finished water interconnections with other systems 

illinois 

illinoisamerican water company which we refer to as ilawc serves a population of approximately 1 million ilawc and american lake water company also a regulated subsidiary in illinois generated approximately 1875 million of operating revenue in 2008 representing approximately 90 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period

at inawc we employ several measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply inawc conducts and updates comprehensive planning studies for each of its water utilities to identify and plan for longterm customer demand trends in order to provide uninterrupted water service new source of supply and water treatment capital projects are planned and timed to match increases in customer demand andor changes in the yield of existing sources of supply and treatment capacities for example to serve our high growth indianapolis southern suburban market our london road project will utilize a new well field and treatment plant that will satisfy the significant needs of increased population and economic development further these facilities are built to be incrementally expandable to match further growth over the next 10 years in cases of extreme demand such as drought conditions customer demandmanagement plans are in place to sustain water sources through to normal demand conditions inawc noblesville district a high growth northern suburb of indianapolis successfully managed high demand in 2007’s heat wavedrought condition through the use of its demand management plan further emergency connections to alternate water sources are in place in some droughtsensitive indiana american water company inc districts 

california 

californiaamerican water company which we refer to as cawc serves a population of approximately 06 million and generated 1286 million of operating revenue in 2008 representing approximately 62 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period 

in california our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including rivers streams lakes and reservoirs and groundwater sources in 2008 we obtained 1 of our water supply from surface water sources and 66 from groundwater sources purchased treated water accounted for 33 of water supply for the same period 

cawc currently operates one surface water treatment plant and approximately 140 groundwater treatment plants which process water extracted from more than 170 groundwater wells we maintain three dams approximately 90 treated water storage facilities 115 pumping stations and our water and wastewater collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 2700 miles of mains and collection pipes we currently operate eight wastewater treatment facilities in california 

in california in order to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply we are in the permitting stages to obtain approval for the construction of a desalination plant to serve our customers on the monterey peninsula we are designing new groundwater wells in our larkfield district and in other areas we are making arrangements to extend or expand our purchase of water from neighboring water providers as part of our san clemente dam project under the supervision of the division of safety of dams dsod we also have been investigating alternatives for complying with seismic safety requirements at our san clemente dam on the carmel river including strengthening or removing the dam and in february 2009 informed dsod that we plan to implement the dam strengthening project pursuant to our application pending before dsod 

west virginia 

west virginiaamerican water company which we refer to as wvawc and its subsidiary bluefield valley water works company which we refer to as bfv serve a population of nearly 06 million and generated approximately 1157 million of operating revenue in 2008 representing approximately 55 of operating revenue of our regulated businesses for that period 

in west virginia our infrastructure and assets are designed to collect treat and distribute water from a variety of surface water sources including streams lakes and reservoirs and in 2008 we obtained 100 of our water supply from surface water sources 

  

wvawc currently operates nine surface water treatment plants we maintain four dams approximately 170 treated water storage facilities 235 pumping stations and our water collection and distribution systems comprise approximately 3400 miles of mains and collection pipes we currently operate one wastewater treatment facility in west virginia 

in west virginia our surface water supplies are sufficient to meet demand under all but the most extreme drought conditions such drought conditions would be atypical for west virginia which has an average annual rainfall of 44 inches 

customers 

we have a large and geographically diverse customer base in our regulated businesses for the purposes of our regulated businesses each customer represents a connection to our water andor wastewater networks as in the case of apartment complexes businesses and many homes multiple individuals may be served by a single connection 

residential customers make up the large majority of customers in all of the states in which we operate in 2008 residential customers accounted for 91 of the customers and 58 of the operating revenue of our regulated businesses residential customers are highly predictable water and wastewater services consumers and they generate stable operating revenue over time and across regions we also serve commercial customers such as shops and businesses industrial customers such as largescale manufacturing and production operations and public authorities such as government buildings and other public sector facilities including schools we supply water to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities and also provide bulk water supplies to other water utilities that distribute them to their own customers 

the following table sets forth the number of water and wastewater customers by customer class for our regulated businesses as of december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 the following table sets forth water services operating revenue by customer class and wastewater services operating revenue excluding other water revenues for our regulated businesses for 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

   

substantially all of our regulated water customers are metered which allows us to measure and bill for our customers’ water consumption typically on a monthly basis our wastewater customers are billed either on a fixed charge basis or based on their water consumption 

customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions particularly during the summer our water systems experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can have a downward effect on water operating revenue and operating income conversely when weather conditions are extremely dry our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies also serving to reduce customer demand and operating revenue these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands other factors affecting our customers’ usage of water includes declining household sizes in the united states conservation initiatives including the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers and the recent deterioration in economy and credit markets which is having an adverse impact on our industrial and commercial customers operational and financial performance 

supplies 

our water and wastewater operations require an uninterrupted supply of chemicals energy and fuel as well as maintenance material and other critical inputs many of these inputs are subject to shortterm price volatility longterm volatility is partially mitigated through existing procurement contracts current supplier continuity plans and the regulatory rate setting process 

because of our geographic diversity we maintain relationships with many chemical equipment and service suppliers in the marketplace and we do not rely on any single entity for a material amount of our supplies we also employ a strategic sourcing process intended to ensure reliability in supply and longterm cost effectiveness as a result of our strategic sourcing process and our strong relationships with suppliers we are able to mitigate interruptions in the delivery of the products and services that are critical to our operations for example during hurricane katrina we were challenged to locate chemical suppliers not affected by the hurricane as a result of our previously negotiated and established relationships with a network of preferred suppliers we were able to secure an uninterrupted supply of materials and to continue our operations in the affected areas without interruptions 

we have backup energy sources at key facilities or alternative sources are available to us that are able to keep our operations running in the event of a temporary loss of our primary energy supplies 

regulation 

economic regulation 

our subsidiaries in the states in which we operate our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective state pucs the term “economic regulation” is intended to indicate that these state pucs regulate the economic aspects of service to the public from systems that fall within their jurisdiction but do not generally establish water quality standards which are set by the epa andor state environmental authorities and enforced through state environmental or health agencies state pucs have broad authority derived from state laws and state constitutions under which they operate to regulate many of the economic aspects of the utilities that fall within their jurisdiction for example state pucs issue certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations that may be required for a company to provide public utility services in specific areas of the state they also must approve the rates and conditions under which service is provided to customers and have extensive authority to establish rules and regulations under which the utilities operate although specific authority might differ from state to state in most states these state pucs must approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations and mergers 

  

and acquisitions in many instances prior to their completion the jurisdiction exercised by each state puc is prescribed by state laws and regulations and therefore varies from state to state regulatory policies not only vary from state to state they may change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

economic regulation of utilities deals with many competing and occasionally conflicting public interests and policy goals the primary responsibility of state pucs is to achieve the overall public interest by balancing the interests of customers and the utility and its stockholders although the specific approach to economic regulation does vary certain general principles are consistent across the states in which our regulated subsidiaries operate based on the united states constitution and state constitutions that prohibit confiscation of property without due process of law and just compensation as well as state statutory provisions and court precedent utilities are entitled to recover through rates charged to customers prudent and reasonable operating costs as well as an opportunity to earn an appropriate return on our prudent used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers and a return of our prudent used and useful capital investment necessary to provide service to customers the state pucs will also generally accord a utility the right to serve specific areas and will also provide investorowned utilities with limited protection from competition because the requirement of an investorowned utility to operate pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations typically prevents other investorowned utilities from competing with it in the authorized area in return the utility undertakes to provide reliable service on a nondiscriminatory basis to all customers within the authorized area 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to the volume of water supplied to a customer multiplied by a pricepergallon set by a tariff approved by the relevant state puc certain states have utilized a full or partial single rate policy under which all customers in a state or certain regions within a state are charged utilizing a single rate structure regardless of which of our individual systems serves them the single tariff structure is based on costs that are determined on a statewide or intrastate regional basis thereby moderating the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs while lowering administrative costs for us and our customers 

the process to obtain approval for a change in rates or rate case involves filing a petition with the state puc on a periodic basis as determined by our capital expenditures needs and our operating costs rate cases are normally initiated by the regulated utility whenever the utility determines it needs to recover increased operating expenses or a return on new capital investment or otherwise determines that its current authorized return is not sufficient given current market conditions to provide a reasonable return on investment typically a rate case will not be filed however unless the current or expected future return is below the allowed rate of return currently authorized by the regulator a state puc may also initiate a rate proceeding or investigation if it believes a utility may be earning in excess of its authorized rate of return rate cases often involve a lengthy and costly administrative process the utility the state puc staff consumer advocates and any other interveners who may participate in the process prepare and file evidence consisting of supporting testimony and documentation this is presented in public hearings in connection with the rate case these hearings which are economic and service quality factfinding in nature are typically conducted in a triallike setting before the state puc or an administrative law judge during the process the utility is required to provide staff and interveners with all relevant information they may request concerning the utility’s operations expenses and investments the sworn evidentiary record then forms the basis for a state puc decision 

some state pucs are more restrictive than others with regard to the types of expenses and investments that may be recovered in rates as well as with regard to the transparency of their ratemaking processes and how they reach their final rate determinations however in evaluating a rate case state pucs typically focus on five areas 

 

  

  

   

  

 the decisions of state pucs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to over a year to complete therefore there is frequently a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates for instance an unexpected increase in chemical costs or new capital investment that is not appropriately reflected in the most recently completed rate case will generally not be recovered by the regulated subsidiary until the next rate case is filed and approved by the state puc our rate case management program is guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operating and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental regulations the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries anticipates the time required for the regulatory process and files a rate case with the goal of obtaining rates that reflect as closely as possible the cost of providing service at the time the rates become effective even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital that are permitted by the state puc 

our regulated subsidiaries also pursue methods to minimize the adverse impact of regulatory lag and have worked with state pucs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result a number of states in which our regulated businesses operate have adopted efficient rate policies including some form of single tariff pricing forwardlooking test years passthrough provisions or infrastructure surcharges forwardlooking test years and infrastructure surcharges reduce the regulatory lag associated with the traditional method of recovering rates from state pucs through lengthy rate cases based on historical information pennsylvania new jersey west virginia kentucky ohio indiana and illinois are examples of states that have adopted a full or partial single tariff pricing policy 

also an increasing number of states are permitting rates to be adjusted outside of a general rate case for certain costs such as a return on capital investments to replace aging infrastructure or increases in expenses beyond the utility’s control such as purchased water costs this infrastructure surcharge mechanism allows our rates to be adjusted and charged to customers outside the context of a general rate proceeding for prespecified portions of our capital expenditures to replace aging infrastructure closer to the time these expenses are incurred for example pennsylvania illinois missouri indiana new york and ohio are examples of states that have in the past allowed tariffs that permit the imposition of surcharges on customers’ bills for infrastructure replacement new jersey california virginia and illinois have allowed surcharges for purchased water costs california has allowed surcharges for power and new york has allowed surcharges for certain costs such as power and chemicals these constructive regulatory mechanisms encourage us to maintain a steady capital expenditure program to repair and improve water and wastewater systems as needed by reducing the regulatory lag on the recovery of prudent expenditures 

the forwardlooking test year mechanism allows us to earn on a more timely basis a return of our current or projected costs and a rate of return on our current or projected invested capital and other “known and measurable changes” in our business some states have permitted use of some form of forecast or forwardlooking test year instead of historical data to set rates examples of these states include illinois kentucky ohio pennsylvania new york tennessee and california in addition a number of states in which we operate have allowed the utility to update historical data for certain changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year this allows the utility to take account of some more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process examples of these states include new mexico texas missouri iowa virginia maryland west virginia new jersey and arizona 

also some of the states in which we operate permit passthrough provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs such as purchased power and property taxes to be passed on to and recovered from customers outside of a general rate case proceeding 

  

another regulatory mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag includes the potential ability in certain circumstances to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is actually in service instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include texas pennsylvania ohio kentucky virginia illinois and california 

in addition some states have permitted us to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the pucs assess the prudency of such projects 

the ability of the company to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the state pucs will accept the company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case however the company strives to use these and other regulatory policies to address issues of regulatory lag wherever appropriate and to expand their use in areas where they may not currently apply 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulation 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater we are also subject to certain regulations regarding fire protection services in the areas we serve these regulations include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and other federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the provision of water and wastewater services particularly with respect to the quality of water we distribute we also are subject to various federal state local and canadian laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes discharges to air and water the cleanup of contaminated sites dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment health and safety state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver 

we maintain a comprehensive environmental policy including responsible business practices compliance with environmental laws and regulations effective use of natural resources and stewardship of biodiversity we believe that our operations are in material compliance with and in many cases surpass minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations water samples across our water system are analyzed on a regular basis in material compliance with regulatory requirements across the company we conduct nearly one million water quality tests each year at our laboratory facilities in addition to continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water for 2008 we achieved greater than a 999 compliance rate for meeting state and federal drinking water standards and 992 for compliance with wastewater requirements 

we participate in the partnership for safe water the united states epa’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbes currently 70 of our facilities have received the program’s “director” award and 65 have maintained it for more than five years 

for fiscal year 2008 our aggregate capital expenditures for environmental health and safety and water quality regulatory compliance were approximately 1500 million and we currently expect to spend similar amounts for such matters in fiscal year 2009 

safe drinking water act 

the federal safe drinking water act and regulations promulgated thereunder establish national quality standards for drinking water the epa has issued rules governing the levels of numerous naturally occurring and manmade chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water and continues to propose new rules these rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting contaminants the treatment systems which may be used for removing contaminants and other requirements federal and state water quality requirements have become increasingly more stringent including increased water testing requirements to reflect public health concerns 

  

for example in 2001 the epa decreased permissible arsenic levels in drinking water and required compliance by water systems by january 2006 in 2003 a new epa rule governing nonradon radionuclides became effective regulating uranium in drinking water for the first time and requiring initial monitoring under state programs by the end of 2007 we believe that we are in material compliance with both these rules 

in order to remove or inactivate microbial organisms the epa has promulgated various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and byproducts of the disinfection process in january 2006 the epa promulgated the longterm 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule and the stage 2 disinfectants and disinfection byproduct rule in october 2006 the epa finalized the ground water rule applicable to water systems providing water from underground sources in 2006 the epa also proposed revisions to the monitoring and reporting requirements of the existing lead and copper rule 

although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements we do not expect current requirements under the safe drinking water act to have a material impact on our operations or financial condition in addition capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates traditionally have been recognized by state public utility commissions as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates as a result we expect to fully recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements 

clean water act 

the federal clean water act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes rivers streams and groundwater in addition to requirements applicable to our sewer collection systems our operations require discharge permits under the national pollutant discharge elimination system or npdes permit program established under the clean water act pursuant to the npdes program the epa or implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems we believe that we maintain the necessary permits and approvals for the discharges from our water and wastewater facilities from time to time discharge violations occur at our facilities some of which result in fines we do not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

other environmental health and safety and water quality matters 

our operations also involve the use storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes for example our water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals and generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements we also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to our operations or facilities or our offsite disposal of wastes although we are not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs our facilities and operations also are subject to requirements under the united states occupational safety and health act and are subject to inspections thereunder for further information see “business—research and development” 

certain of our subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters these proceedings are described further in the section entitled “item 3—legal proceedings” 

growth 

in the course of pursuing our growth strategy we periodically acquire water and wastewater utilities by making acquisitions in our existing markets and certain markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses we have executed a number of larger acquisitions in the past 10 years in 1996 our regulated subsidiary pawc acquired the regulated water utility operations of pennsylvania gas and water company a subsidiary of pennsylvania enterprises inc for approximately 4094 million in 1999 we 

  

acquired the privately held national enterprises inc in a transaction valued at 7000 million in 2002 we acquired the water and wastewater facilities in six states from citizens communications company for an aggregate purchase price of 9798 million we also acquire water and wastewater utilities through tuckins the proximity of tuckin opportunities to our regulated footprint allows us to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations using our existing management and to achieve efficiencies historically pursuing tuckins has been a fundamental part of our growth strategy we intend to continue to grow our regulated footprint through tuckin acquisitions of small water andor wastewater systems tuckins allow us to integrate systems operations and management and achieve efficiencies we intend to continue to expand our regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in our existing markets and if appropriate certain markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses 

the chart below sets forth our historical tuckins for 1996 through december 2008 in addition to the 10 acquisitions completed in 2008 there are another three transactions that were signed in 2008 and are expected to be completed in 2009 the largest of which is the trenton acquisition 

 

while our business mix will continue to focus predominantly on regulated activities we are pursuing opportunities in nonregulated businesses that are complementary to our regulated businesses and our capabilities we plan to focus on our publicprivate partnerships including om and military contracts and services we intend to capitalize on our om expertise as well as our existing municipal and government relationships to identify and bid for new ventures that have attractive risk and return characteristics we also intend to continue to expand our nonregulated homeowner services business which provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes in areas within and beyond our existing regulated footprint 

competition and condemnation 

in our regulated businesses we generally do not face direct or indirect competition in providing services in our existing markets because i we operate within those markets pursuant to certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations issued by state pucs and ii the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a barrier to market entry our regulated businesses do face competition from governmental agencies other investorowned utilities and strategic buyers in connection with entering new markets and making strategic acquisitions consolidation is changing the competitive landscape as small local utilities struggle to meet their capital spending requirements and look to partner with investorowned utilities we also face competition in offering services to new real estate developers where we compete with others on the basis of the financial terms we offer for our services the availability of water and our ability to commence providing services on a timely basis our largest investorowned competitors based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served are aqua america inc united water owned by suez environment company sa american states water co and california water services group 

  

the certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations pursuant to which we operate our regulated businesses do not prevent municipalities from competing with us to provide water and wastewater utility services further the potential exists that portions of our subsidiaries’ utility assets could be acquired by municipalities or other local government entities through one or more of the following methods 

 

  

  

 the sale price for such a transaction initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law or the price may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular franchise or charter we believe our operating subsidiaries would be entitled to fair market value for any assets required to be sold and we are of the opinion that fair market value would be in excess of the book value for such assets 

we are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business on september 5 2008 california american water sold the assets of our felton california water system which served approximately 1330 customers to the san lorenzo valley water district the most recent prior sale of our water and wastewater systems under threat of condemnation occurred in 2003 we actively monitor condemnation activities that may affect us as soon as we become aware of them we do not believe that condemnation poses a material threat to our ability to operate our regulated businesses 

our nonregulated businesses 

in addition to our regulated businesses we operate the following nonregulated businesses which generated 2722 million of operating revenue in 2008 representing 116 of total operating revenue for the same periods no single group within our nonregulated businesses generates in excess of 10 of our aggregate revenue 

contract operations group 

our contract operations group enters into publicprivate partnerships including om and dbo contracts for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for municipalities the united states military and other customers we typically make no capital investment under our contracts with municipalities and other customers instead performing our services for a fee we may make limited capital investments under our contracts with the united states military our contract operations group generated revenue of 1701 million in 2008 representing 625 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses 

we are currently party to more than 49 contracts across the united states and canada with contracts ranging in term from three to 50 years the services provided under our om contracts vary in size and scope for instance 44 of our om contracts are operational in nature with repair and replace elements but not dbos annual operating revenue from the om contracts varies from 03 million to 82 million per contract in addition we are an active participant in the united states department of defense’s utility privatization program or upp the department of defense has awarded us seven 50year contracts for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems since 2003 and we have one 3year subcontract with a municipality acting as primary contractor with the department of defense for similar services on an interim basis until construction of new connections to an existing municipal facility is completed remaining lifetime revenue under all these om contracts total approximately 22888 million as of december 31 2008 all of the contracts with the us government may be terminated in whole or in part prior to the end of the 50year term for convenience of the us government or as a result of default or nonperformance by the subsidiary performing the contract in either event we are entitled to recover the remaining amount of our capital investment pursuant to the terms of a termination settlement with the us government at the time of termination as provided in each of the contracts 

  

the contract price for each of these contracts is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations and every three years thereafter price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions 

in general the contract operations group is engaged in providing these services to systems with over 3000 customers and in many cases far larger as distinguished from the om services provided by our applied water management group usually to systems with less than 3000 customers however there is some overlap in size of systems served due to geographic and operational considerations 

applied water management group 

our applied water management group works with customers to design build and operate smallerscale water and wastewater treatment plants typically serving up to 3000 customers our typical customers are real estate developers industrial companies and new or expanding communities we specialize in providing reliable advanced and ecofriendly water and wastewater solutions to suit each customer’s water needs our applied water management group generated revenue of 238 million in 2008 representing 87 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses 

the applied water management group currently serves our customer base primarily in the northeastern united states and was responsible for the design construction and operation of advanced wastewater treatment recycling systems for sites as varied as residential buildings in battery park city in new york city and gillette stadium in foxborough massachusetts approximately 38 of the applied water management group’s business involves operating and maintaining smallerscale water and wastewater plants made up of a mixture of facilities that we designed and built and some which we only operate 

homeowner services group 

our homeowner services group provides services to domestic homeowners to protect against the cost of repairing broken or leaking pipes inside and outside their homes we initially offered these services within territories covered by our regulated subsidiaries but are expanding to enable other utilities outside our territories to offer the services to their customers in the marketing of these services we focus on educating homeowners about their service line ownership responsibility and providing convenient and cost effective solutions to internal and external water line and sewer line repairs our homeowner services group generated revenue of 475 million in 2008 representing 175 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses 

our service line protection programs offer customers various service contracts for a monthly fee that cover repair of water line leaks and breaks sewer line clogs and blockages and emergency inhome plumbing problems in the event of a problem customers contact our national call center and we dispatch local contractors to the customer’s home to undertake the necessary repairs 

our homeowners services group currently has approximately 680000 customer contracts in 15 of the states where we operate our regulated businesses we intend to expand our service offering to the remaining key states in which we operate our regulated businesses as well as other viable territories 

building on the success of its service line protection programs our homeowner services group recently introduced linesaver™ an exclusive program for municipalities and public water systems that is available across the country the linesaver™ program involves partnering with municipalities to offer our protection programs to homeowners serviced by the municipal system while providing an income opportunity to the municipality or public water system we entered into our first line saver ™ program partnership with the city of trenton new jersey and are currently discussing partnerships with municipalities across the nation 

  

other nonregulated businesses 

our nonregulated businesses also include i our carbon services group which provides granular activated carbon for water purification to our regulated businesses as well as certain outside customers and ii our residuals group terratec which provides environmentally sustainable management and disposal of biosolids and wastewater byproducts our united statesbased residuals group was divested effective june 29 2007 these other nonregulated businesses generated revenue of 308 million in 2008 in the aggregate representing 113 of revenue for our nonregulated businesses 

competition 

we face competition in our nonregulated businesses from a number of service providers including veolia american states omi and southwest water particularly in the area of om contracting securing new om contracts is highly competitive as these contracts are awarded based on a combination of customer relationships service levels competitive pricing references and technical expertise we also face competition in maintaining existing om contracts to which we are a party as these frequently come up for renegotiation and are subject to an open bidding process 

research and development 

we established a formal research and development program in 1981 with the goal of improving water quality and operational effectiveness in all areas of our businesses our research and development personnel are located at two of our facilities the regional center in voorhees new jersey and our research laboratory in delran new jersey in addition our quality control and testing laboratory in belleville illinois supports research through sophisticated testing and analysis since its inception our research and development program has evolved to become a leading waterrelated research program achieving advancements in the science of drinking water including sophisticated water testing procedures and desalination technologies 

since the formation of the epa in 1970 we have collaborated with the agency to achieve effective environmental health and safety and water quality regulation this relationship has developed to include sharing of our research and national water quality monitoring data in addition to our treatment and distribution system optimization research our engagement with the epa has helped us to achieve a leadership position for our company within the water and wastewater industry and has provided us with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives thereby allowing us to anticipate and to accommodate our future compliance requirements 

in 2008 we spent 25 million on research and development which represents an increase of 25 over the 20 million spent in 2007 approximately onethird of our research budget is comprised of competitively awarded outside research grants such grants reduce the cost of research and allow collaboration with leading national and international researchers 

we believe that continued research and development activities are critical to maintaining our leadership position in the industry and will provide us with a competitive advantage as we seek additional business with new and existing customers 

support services 

our american water works service company subsidiary provides centrally administered professional services to our regulated businesses under the terms of contracts with these companies that have been approved by state pucs where necessary these services which are provided at cost may include accounting administration business development communications corporate secretarial engineering financial health and safety human resources information systems legal operations procurement rates security risk management water quality and research and development similar services may be provided to our nonregulated businesses these arrangements afford our affiliated companies professional and technical talent on an economical and timely basis 

  

we operate two national customer service centers with personnel located in alton illinois and pensacola florida these centers employ approximately 700 people in total and process telephone calls from customers across all of our service areas 

community relations 

corporate responsibility is a critical part of how we do business at american water from our community involvement to the steps we have taken to reduce our environmental footprint we believe that we have the opportunity to drive our business from a broader perspective one that inspires and wins customer community employee and shareholder loyalty and support through responsible business practices 

corporate responsibility encompasses four main areas at american water including environmental responsibility economic health social wellbeing and governance together these focus areas are designed to create shareholder value in a number of ways including attracting and retaining talent avoiding operational and reputational risk and identifying new opportunities that respond to sustainable solutions 

communication activities for our regulated businesses are designed to ensure that our customers regulators elected and appointed officials as well as community leaders are fully informed about water and wastewaterrelated issues affecting their communities we focus on developing effective relationships and have in place experienced staff members in the areas of community relations government relations media relations and marketing we believe that an informed customer is more likely to be a satisfied customer 

our primary focus for our regulated businesses is on consumer education we target our communications to ensure that all of our audiences are well informed and uptodate on water and wastewaterrelated issues through community outreach meetings bill inserts to our customers newspaper articles on timely topics paid advertisements on important issues annual water quality reports or oneonone meetings to update key community and government leaders we continually provide information on topics such as the need for infrastructure investments that we are making within a community the impact on rates and services water supply needs water conservation requirements as well as information on water quality we believe that educating our customers about these topics leads to greater understanding of the service issues that we face and results in a higher level of customer satisfaction for instance we believe that our customers are less likely to react negatively to a rate increase if they have been informed that the rate increase is necessitated by an infrastructure investment necessary to continue to provide high quality water service we also believe that our customers are less likely to have a negative reaction to water use restrictions if they understand the reasons behind the restrictions and that all customers are being impacted by the same inconveniences 

communications activities for our nonregulated businesses focus on identifying prospective market opportunities for growth and expansion and educating target markets on the value we can bring to solving specific water supply water quality or other water and wastewaterrelated issues our experienced business development team reinforces the expertise experience and capabilities we can provide to communities or developers through industry trade shows public speaking opportunities industry conferences and paid advertising publicprivate partnerships or contract relationships which may include dbo projects for customers or providing experienced om services for various sized water and wastewaterrelated projects 

employee matters 

currently we employ approximately 7300 fulltime employees of these approximately 3700 or approximately 51 are represented by unions we have 76 collective bargaining agreements in place with the 20 different unions representing our unionized employees approximately onefourth of our local union contracts expire annually we maintain good relations with our unionized workforce and have no significant history of strikes or labor stoppages 

  

training 

we place emphasis on the selection of wellqualified employees and seek to provide the best and most uptodate training to ensure that our water and wastewater operations function efficiently and safely we provide internal training programs designed to meet the standards demanded by the regulatory authorities in the states where we operate our regulated business 

security 

due to terrorist and other risks we have heightened security at our facilities over the past several years and have taken added precautions to protect our employees and the water delivered to our customers we have a security programs department that provides oversight and governance of physical and information security throughout our operations and is responsible for designing implementing monitoring and supporting active and effective physical and information security controls 

in 2002 federal legislation was enacted that resulted in new regulations concerning security of water facilities including those that required companies to submit vulnerability assessment studies to the federal government we have complied with epa regulations concerning vulnerability assessments and have made filings to the epa as required vulnerability assessments are conducted regularly to evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and serve as the basis for further capital investment in security for the facility information security controls are deployed or integrated to prevent unauthorized access to company information systems assure the continuity of business processes dependent upon automation ensure the integrity of our data and support regulatory and legislative compliance requirements in addition communication plans have been developed as a component of our procedures while we do not make public comments on the details of our security programs we have been in contact with federal state and local law enforcement agencies to coordinate and improve the security of our water delivery systems and to safeguard our water supply

 item 1a risk factors tableend we operate in a market and regulatory environment that involves significant risks many of which are beyond our control in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this form 10k the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects any of the following risks either alone or taken together could materially and adversely affect our business financial position or results of operations if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition operating results and prospects could be adversely affected which in turn could adversely affect the value of our common stock 

risks related to our industry and business 

our utility operations are heavily regulated decisions by state pucs and other regulatory agencies can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

our regulated businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries economically regulated by state pucs economic regulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant effect on our business and results of operations generally the state pucs authorize us to charge rates that they determine are sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses to enable us to finance the addition of new or the replacement of existing water and wastewater infrastructure and to allow us the opportunity to earn what they determine to be an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

our ability to meet our financial objectives depends upon the rates authorized by the various state pucs we periodically file rate increase applications with state pucs the ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly we can provide no assurances that our rate increase requests will be granted even if approved there is no guarantee that approval will be given in a timely manner or at a sufficient level to cover our expenses the recovery of our investment andor provide us an opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment if the authorized rates are insufficient to cover operating expenses to allow for the recovery of our investment and to provide an appropriate return on invested capital or if the rate increase decisions are delayed our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity may be adversely affected even if rates are sufficient we face the risk that we will not achieve the rates of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital that are permitted by the state puc 

our operations and the quality of water we supply are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations our operating costs have increased and are expected to continue to increase as a result of complying with environmental laws and regulations we also could incur substantial costs as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations 

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include the united states clean water act of 1972 which we refer to as the clean water act and the united states safe drinking water act of 1974 which we refer to as the safe drinking water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver if we deliver water or wastewater services to our customers that do not comply with regulatory standards or otherwise violate environmental laws regulations or permits or other health and safety and water quality regulations we could incur substantial fines penalties or other sanctions or costs or damage to our reputation in the most serious cases regulators could force us to discontinue operations and sell our operating assets to another utility or municipality given the nature of our business which in part involves supplying water for human 

  

consumption any potential noncompliance with or violation of environmental laws or regulations would likely pose a more significant risk to us than to an issuer not similarly involved in the water and wastewater industry 

we incur substantial operating and capital costs on an ongoing basis to comply with environmental laws and regulations and other health and safety and water quality regulations these laws and regulations and their enforcement have tended to become more stringent over time and new or stricter requirements could increase our costs although we may seek to recover ongoing compliance costs in our rates there can be no guarantee that the various state pucs or similar regulatory bodies that govern our regulated businesses would approve rate increases to recover such costs or that such costs will not adversely and materially affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

we may also incur liabilities under environmental laws and regulations requiring us to investigate and clean up environmental contamination at our properties or at offsite locations where we have disposed of waste or caused adverse environmental impacts the discovery of previously unknown conditions or the imposition of cleanup obligations in the future could result in significant costs and could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity such remediation losses may not be covered by our insurance policies and may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

market disruptions caused by the worldwide financial crisis could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and our ability to meet longterm commitments which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on our revolving credit facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs further disruptions in the credit markets or further deterioration of the banking industry’s financial condition may discourage or prevent lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets on september 15 2008 we sought to issue commercial paper but were unable to consummate the issuance due to adverse market conditions in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we are borrowing under our existing 840 million revolving credit facility commitments under this revolving credit facility of 685 million mature on september 15 2013 and the remaining 155 million expire on september 15 2012 american water capital corp “awcc” our financing subsidiary had 3450 million of outstanding borrowings and 439 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 23 2009 awcc had 1785 million of outstanding overnight commercial paper as of february 23 2009 we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2008 the company has issued through its subsidiaries 1203 million of variable rate demand bonds which are periodically remarketed during the months of january and february 2009 awcc purchased its variable rate demand bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates at february 23 2009 awcc holds all 1203 million in treasury we can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates 

longer term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty reduced financing alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to the liquidity needed for our business any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the market stabilizes or until alternative financing can be arranged such measures could include deferring capital expenditures reducing dividend payments and reducing other discretionary expenditures 

continued market disruptions could cause a broad economic downturn which may lead to increased incidence of customers’ failure to pay for services delivered could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flow 

the capital market disruptions could result in higher interest rates on publicly issued debt securities increased commercial paper borrowing costs and increased costs related to variable rate debt as a result continuation of the market disruptions could increase the company’s interest expense and adversely impact our results of operations 

  

the disruption in the capital markets and its actual or perceived effects on particular businesses and the greater economy also adversely affects the value of the investments held within the company’s employee benefit plan trusts significant declines in the value of the investments held within the company’s employee benefit plan trusts may require the company to increase contributions to those trusts in order to meet future funding requirements if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value in the foreseeable future these trends may also adversely impact the company’s results of operations net cash flows and financial positions including our shareholders’ equity 

market conditions may unfavorably impact the value of benefit plan assets and liabilities which then could require significant additional funding 

the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans and could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position the company has significant obligations in these areas and the company holds significant assets in these trusts these assets are subject to market fluctuations which may affect investment returns which may fall below the company’s projected return rates a decline in the market value of the pension and postretirement benefit plan assets as was experienced in 2008 will increase the funding requirements under the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans if the actual asset returns do not recover these declines in value additionally the company’s pension and postretirement benefit plan liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates as interest rates decrease the liabilities increase potentially increasing benefit expense and funding requirements further changes in demographics including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions may also increase the funding requirements of the obligations related to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans also future increases in pension and other postretirement costs as a result of reduced plan assets may not be fully recoverable from our customers and our the results of operations and financial position of the company could be negatively affected 

during 2008 the company’s unfunded status of its pension plan increased significantly primarily due to lower than expected 2008 asset returns which are expected to result in increased benefit costs and required funding contributions in future years based on current plan assets and expected future asset returns the company currently estimates the increase to pension and postretirement expense net of capitalized amounts in 2009 to be approximately 32 million pretax it is the company’s intent to work with pucs in the states in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of operations the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1259 million 1325 million 1247 million 1619 million and 1232 million in 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates 

changes in laws and regulations over which we have no control can significantly affect our business and results of operations 

any governmental entity that regulates our operations may enact new legislation or adopt new regulations or policies at any time and new judicial decisions may change the interpretation of existing legislation or regulations at any time the individuals who serve as regulators are elected or are political appointees therefore elections which result in a change of political administration or new appointments may also result in changes in the individuals who serve as regulators and the policies of the regulatory agencies that they serve new laws or regulations new interpretations of existing laws or regulations or changes in agency policy including as a response to shifts in public opinion or conditions imposed during the regulatory hearing process may affect our business in a number of ways including the following 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 any of these changes or any other changes in laws regulations judicial decisions or agency policies applicable to us may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

weather conditions natural hazards availability of water supplies and competing uses may interfere with our sources of water demand for water services and our ability to supply water to customers 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water as a general rule sources of public water supply including rivers lakes streams and groundwater aquifers are held in the public trust and are not owned by private interests as such we typically do not own the water that we use in our operations and the availability of our water supply is established through allocation rights and passingflow requirements set by governmental entities passingflow requirements set minimum volumes of water that must pass through specified water sources such as rivers and streams in order to maintain environmental habitats and meet water allocation rights of downstream users allocation rights are imposed to ensure sustainability of major water sources and passing flow requirements are most often imposed on source waters from smaller rivers lakes and streams these requirements can change from time to time and adversely impact our water supply drought overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water 

governmental restrictions on water use may also result in decreased use of water services even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations seasonal drought conditions that would impact our water services are possible across all of our service areas and drought conditions currently exist in several areas of the united states however these conditions are more prevalent in the northeast and west where supply capacity is limited and per capita water demand is high if a regional drought were to occur affecting our service areas and adjacent systems governmental restrictions may be imposed on all systems within a region independent of the supply adequacy of any individual system there have been no mandatory water use restriction orders to date in 2009 although voluntary conservation efforts or water use restrictions were implemented during certain periods of 2008 in parts of new jersey new mexico new york and california following drought conditions water demand may not return to predrought levels even after restrictions are lifted cool and wet weather may also reduce demand for water thereby adversely affecting our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

  

service interruptions due to severe weather events are possible across all our service areas these include winter storms and freezing conditions in our colder climate service areas high wind conditions in our service areas known to experience tornados earthquakes in our service areas known to experience seismic activity high water conditions for our facilities located in or near designated flood plains hurricanes in our coastal service areas and severe electrical storms which are possible across all of our service areas these weather events may affect the condition or operability of our facilities limiting or preventing us from delivering water or wastewater services to our customers or requiring us to make substantial capital expenditures to repair any damage any interruption in our ability to supply water or to collect treat and properly dispose of wastewater or any costs associated with restoring service could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations furthermore losses from business interruptions or damage to our facilities might not be covered by our insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

declining residential per customer water usage may reduce our longterm revenues financial condition and results of operations 

increased water conservation including through the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers combined with declining household sizes in the united states has contributed to a trend of declining residential per customer water usage our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon revenue generated from rates we charge to our residential customers for the volume of water they use the rate we charge for our water is regulated by state pucs and we may not unilaterally adjust our rates to reflect demand declining usage will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure rate increases or to grow our residential customer base to the extent necessary to offset the residential usage decline 

risks associated with the collection treatment and disposal of wastewater may impose significant costs 

the wastewater collection treatment and disposal operations of our subsidiaries are subject to substantial regulation and involve significant environmental risks if collection or sewage systems fail overflow or do not operate properly untreated wastewater or other contaminants could spill onto nearby properties or into nearby streams and rivers causing damage to persons or property injury to aquatic life and economic damages which may not be recoverable in rates this risk is most acute during periods of substantial rainfall or flooding which are the main causes of sewer overflow and system failure liabilities resulting from such damage could adversely and materially affect our business results of operations and financial condition moreover in the event that we are deemed liable for any damage caused by overflow our losses might not be covered by insurance policies and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

our regulated businesses require significant capital expenditures to maintain infrastructure and expand our rate base and may suffer if we fail to secure appropriate funding to make investments or if we suffer delays in completing major capital expenditure projects 

the water and wastewater utility business is capital intensive in addition to our acquisition strategy we invest significant amounts of capital to add replace and maintain property plant and equipment in 2008 we invested 10088 million in net companyfunded capital improvements we expect the level of capital expenditures necessary to maintain the integrity of our systems to increase in the future we fund these projects from cash generated from operations borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper programs and the issuance of longterm debt and equity securities we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt and equity capital markets on favorable terms or at all 

rwe has certain registration rights with respect to future issuances of our equity securities and intends to fully divest its remaining ownership of american water as soon as reasonably practicable subject to market conditions the registration rights agreement entered into with rwe imposes certain restrictions on our ability to issue equity securities in amounts beyond specified thresholds without rwe’s consent sales of our common stock by rwe as well as the restrictions in the registration rights agreement may make it more difficult or 

  

costly for us to raise additional equity in the future furthermore if we are unable to raise sufficient equity we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets on favorable terms or at all 

in addition we believe that our dividend policy could limit but not preclude our ability to pursue growth in particular this limitation could be significant for example with respect to large acquisitions and growth opportunities that require cash investments in amounts greater than our operating subsidiaries’ available cash or external financing resources in order to fund construction expenditures acquisitions including tuckin acquisitions and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness and pay dividends at the level currently anticipated under our dividend policy we expect that we will need additional financing however we intend to retain sufficient cash from operating activities after the distribution of dividends to fund a portion of our capital expenditures for further discussion of our acquisition strategy see “item 1—growth” 

if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we may fail to maintain our existing property plant and equipment realize our capital investment strategies meet our growth targets and successfully expand the rate base upon which we are able to earn future returns on our investment and a return of our investment even if we have adequate resources to make required capital expenditures we face the additional risk that we will not complete our major capital expenditures on time as a result of construction delays or other obstacles each of these outcomes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we also face the risk that after we make substantial capital expenditures the rate increases granted to us by state pucs may not be sufficient to recover our prudently incurred operating expenses and to allow us the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital 

the failure of or the requirement to repair upgrade or dismantle any of our dams may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we own approximately 100 dams a failure of any of those dams could result in injuries and property damage downstream for which we may be liable the failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

we also are required from time to time to repair or upgrade the dams that we own the cost of such repairs can be and has been material we might not be able to recover such costs through rates the inability to recover these higher costs or regulatory lag in the recovery of such costs can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

the federal and state agencies that regulate our operations may adopt rules and regulations requiring us to dismantle our dams federal and state agencies are currently considering rules and regulations that could require us to strengthen or dismantle one of our dams on the carmel river in california due to safety concerns related to seismic activity any requirement to strengthen or dismantle this dam could result in substantial costs that may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we are currently engaged in negotiations with federal and state agencies and local stakeholders on a plan to maintain our existing carmel river dams or to share the costs of dismantling one of them with those federal and state agencies and local stakeholders these negotiations could be delayed or abandoned 

any failure of our network of water and wastewater pipes and water reservoirs could result in losses and damages that may affect our financial condition and reputation 

our operating subsidiaries distribute water and wastewater through an extensive network of pipes and store water in reservoirs located across the united states a failure of major pipes or reservoirs could result in injuries and property damage for which we may be liable the failure of major pipes and reservoirs may also result in the need to shut down some facilities or parts of our network in order to conduct repairs such failures and shutdowns may limit our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and to meet the water and wastewater delivery requirements prescribed by governmental regulators including state pucs with jurisdiction 

  

over our operations and adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow liquidity and reputation any business interruption or other losses might not be covered by insurance policies or be recoverable in rates and such losses may make it difficult for us to secure insurance in the future at acceptable rates 

contamination of our sources of water could result in service interruptions and human exposure to hazardous substances and subject our subsidiaries to civil or criminal enforcement actions private litigation and cleanup obligations 

our water supplies are subject to contamination including contamination from naturallyoccurring compounds chemicals in groundwater systems pollution resulting from manmade sources such as perchlorate and methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and possible terrorist attacks in the event that our water supply is contaminated we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply of water from another water source including in some cases through the purchase of water from a thirdparty supplier in addition we may incur significant costs in order to treat the contaminated source through expansion of our current treatment facilities or development of new treatment methods if we are unable to substitute water supply in a costeffective manner our financial condition results of operations cash flow liquidity and reputation may be adversely affected we might not be able to recover costs associated with treating or decontaminating water supplies through rates or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner moreover we could be held liable for environmental damage as well as damages arising from toxic tort or other lawsuits or criminal enforcement actions or other consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances in our drinking water supplies 

our liquidity and earnings could be adversely affected by increases in our production costs including the cost of chemicals electricity fuel or other significant materials used in the water and wastewater treatment process 

we incur significant production costs in connection with the delivery of our water and wastewater services our production costs are driven by inputs such as chemicals used to treat water and wastewater as well as electricity and fuel which are used to operate pumps and other equipment used in water treatment and delivery and wastewater collection treatment and disposal we also incur production costs for waste disposal for 2008 production costs accounted for 114 of our total operating costs these costs can and do increase unexpectedly and in substantial amounts as occurred in california during 2001 and illinois during 2007 when the cost of electricity rose substantially 

our regulated businesses might not be able to recover increases in the costs of chemicals electricity fuel other significant inputs or waste disposal through rates or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner our nonregulated businesses may not be able to recover these costs in contract prices or other terms the inability to recover these higher costs can affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

our reliance on thirdparty suppliers poses significant risks to our business and prospects 

we contract with third parties for goods and services that are essential to our operations such as maintenance services pipes chemicals electricity water gasoline diesel and other materials we are subject to substantial risks because of our reliance on these suppliers for example 

 

  

  

  

  

   

as a result of any of these factors we may be required to find alternative suppliers for the raw materials and services on which we rely accordingly we may experience delays in obtaining appropriate raw materials and services on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities from such alternative suppliers at a reasonable price which could interrupt services to our customers and adversely affect our revenues financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

risks associated with potential acquisitions or investments may adversely affect us 

we will continue to seek to acquire or invest in additional regulated water or wastewater systems including by acquiring systems in markets in the united states where we do not currently operate our regulated businesses and through tuckins we will also continue to seek to enter into publicprivate partnerships including om military and design build and operate which we refer to as dbo contracts and services that complement our businesses these transactions may result in 

 

  

  

  

  

 we may also experience difficulty in obtaining required regulatory approvals for acquisitions and any regulatory approvals we obtain may require us to agree to costly and restrictive conditions imposed by regulators sales of our common stock by rwe as well as the restrictions in the registration rights agreement between us and rwe may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise additional equity to fund an acquisition or to issue shares as consideration in connection with an acquisition we may not identify all significant risks when conducting due diligence for a transaction and we could be exposed to potential liabilities for which we will not be indemnified there may be difficulties integrating new businesses including bringing newly acquired businesses up to the necessary level of regulatory compliance retaining and integrating key personnel achieving strategic objectives and integrating acquired assets and technological systems the demands of identifying and transitioning newly acquired businesses or pursuing investment opportunities may also divert management’s attention from other business concerns and otherwise disrupt our business any of these risks may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets causing us to record impairments that may negatively affect our results of operations or require us to effect additional dilutive equity issuances 

our total assets include substantial goodwill at december 31 2008 our goodwill totaled 16995 million the goodwill is primarily associated with the acquisition of american water by an affiliate of rwe in 2003 and the acquisition of e’town corporation in 2001 goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price the purchaser paid over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is recorded at fair value on the date of an acquisition and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” or sfas no 142 is reviewed annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable annual impairment reviews are performed at november 30 of each year and interim reviews are performed when management determines that a triggering event has occurred we have been required to reflect as required by sfas no 142 and other applicable accounting rules a noncash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment in the amounts of 7500 million 5093 million and 2278 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively these amounts include impairments relating to discontinued operations as a result of these impairments net income was reduced by 7385 million 5015 million and 2236 million in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

the company may be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

our regulated businesses compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities as well as strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities which may hinder our ability to grow our business 

we compete with governmental entities other regulated utilities as well as strategic and financial buyers for acquisition opportunities including tuckins our competitors may impede our growth by purchasing water utilities near our existing operations thereby preventing us from acquiring them competing governmental entities utilities and strategic and financial buyers have challenged and may in the future challenge our applications for new service territories our growth could be hindered if we are not able to compete effectively for new territories with other companies or strategic and financial buyers that have lower costs of operations or that can submit more attractive bids 

the assets of our regulated businesses are subject to condemnation through eminent domain 

municipalities and other government subdivisions have historically been involved in the provision of water and wastewater services in the united states and organized movements may arise from time to time in one or more of the service areas in which our regulated businesses operate to convert our assets to public ownership and operation through the governmental power of eminent domain should a municipality or other government subdivision seek to acquire our assets through eminent domain we may resist the acquisition contesting an exercise of condemnation through eminent domain may result in costly legal proceedings and may divert the attention of the affected regulated business’s management from the operation of its business 

on september 5 2008 under threat of condemnation california american water sold the assets of our felton california water system which served approximately 1330 customers to the san lorenzo valley water district which we refer to as slvwd the most recent prior sale of our water and wastewater systems under threat of condemnation occurred in 2003 if a municipality or other government subdivision succeeds in acquiring the assets of one or more of our regulated businesses through eminent domain there is a risk that we will not receive adequate compensation for the business that we will not be able to keep the compensation or that we will not be able to divest the business without incurring significant onetime charges 

in order to consummate the proposed rwe divestiture we and rwe were required to obtain approvals from thirteen state pucs there can be no guarantee that some state puc approvals already granted to us will not be appealed withdrawn modified or stayed 

to consummate the proposed rwe divestiture we and rwe obtained regulatory approvals from state pucs in 13 states the state puc approval in illinois has been appealed and there can be no guarantee that the state puc approval in illinois will not be overturned moreover some of our existing state puc approvals may be withdrawn or altered in the future by the state pucs because they retain authority to withdraw or modify their prior decisions there also can be no guarantee that in conjunction with an appeal or otherwise a stay or other form of injunctive relief will not be granted by a state puc or reviewing court 

in addition two of the regulatory approvals that we and rwe obtained expire on april 22 2010 and another approval expires on april 22 2011 if rwe does not fully divest its remaining ownership of american water by 

  

such dates then we and rwe may be required to seek an extension of such approvals as applicable which process may result in delays costs and the imposition of additional conditions on us or on rwe 

in order to obtain the state puc approvals to consummate the proposed rwe divestiture we were required to accept certain conditions and restrictions that could increase our costs 

some of the regulatory approvals contain conditions and restrictions including reporting obligations obligations to maintain appropriate creditworthiness restrictions on changes of control prohibitions on the pass through of our initial sarbanesoxley act compliance costs prohibitions on the passthrough of certain costs of the initial public offering and related transactions service quality and staffing level requirements and the maintenance of specific collective bargaining agreements and retirement and certain other postemployment benefit programs these conditions and restrictions could increase our costs and adversely affect our business 

our nonregulated businesses through american water excluding our regulated subsidiaries provide performance guarantees and other forms of financial security to our publicsector clients that could be claimed by our clients or potential clients if we do not meet certain obligations 

under the terms of some of our indebtedness and some of our agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities with municipalities other governmental entities and other customers american water excluding its regulated subsidiaries provides guarantees of the performance of our nonregulated businesses including financial guarantees or deposits to ensure performance of certain obligations at december 31 2008 we had remaining performance commitments as measured by remaining contract revenue totaling approximately 22888 million and this amount is likely to increase if our nonregulated businesses grow the presence of these commitments may adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult for us to secure financing on attractive terms in addition if the obligor on the instrument fails to perform certain obligations to the satisfaction of the party that holds the performance commitments that party may seek to enforce the performance commitments against us or proceed against the deposit in that event our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity could be adversely affected 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts and face the risk that the owners of those systems may fail to maintain those systems which will negatively affect us as the operators of the systems 

we operate a number of water and wastewater systems under om contracts pursuant to these contracts we operate the system according to the standards set forth in the applicable contract and it is generally the responsibility of the owner to undertake capital improvements in some cases we may not be able to convince the owner to make needed improvements in order to maintain compliance with applicable regulations although violations and fines incurred by water and wastewater systems may be the responsibility of the owner of the system under these contracts those noncompliance events may reflect poorly on us as the operator of the system and damage our reputation and in some cases may result in liability to the same extent as if we were the owner 

our nonregulated businesses are party to longterm contracts to operate and maintain water and wastewater systems under which we may incur costs in excess of payments received 

some of our nonregulated businesses enter into longterm contracts pursuant to which they agree to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities which includes responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of those facilities in exchange for an annual fee our nonregulated businesses are generally subject to the risk that costs associated with operating and maintaining the facilities may exceed the fees received from the municipality or other contracting party in addition directly or through our nonregulated subsidiaries we often guarantee our nonregulated businesses’ obligations under those contracts losses under these contracts or guarantees may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

  

we rely on our it systems to assist with the management of our business and customer and supplier relationships and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 

our it systems are an integral part of our business and a serious disruption of our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently which in turn could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and cause our results of operations to be reduced we depend on our it systems to bill customers process orders provide customer service manage construction projects manage our financial records track assets remotely monitor certain of our plants and facilities and manage human resources inventory and accounts receivable collections our it systems also allow us to purchase products from our suppliers and bill customers on a timely basis maintain costeffective operations and provide service to our customers our it systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 such damages or interruptions may result in physical and electronic loss of customer or financial data security breaches misappropriation and similar events in addition the lack of redundancy for certain of our it systems including billing systems could exacerbate the impact on the company of any of the foregoing events 

in addition we may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our business and we might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary upgrades or replacements of our outdated existing technology to allow us to continue to operate at our current level of efficiency 

our indebtedness could affect our business adversely and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our liquidity needs 

as of december 31 2008 our indebtedness including preferred stock with mandatory redemption requirements was 53030 million and our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a deficit position our indebtedness could have important consequences including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 in order to meet our capital expenditure needs we may be required to make additional borrowings under our credit facilities or be required to issue new debt securities in the capital markets we can provide no assurances that we will be able to access the debt capital markets or do so on favorable terms if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks we now face could intensify limiting our ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms 

we will depend primarily on operations to fund our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance which will be affected by financial business economic competitive legislative regulatory and other factors beyond our 

  

control if we do not have enough money to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow additional funds or sell additional equity if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business that would prevent us from maintaining or increasing our business and cause our operating results and prospects to be affected adversely 

our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger prepayment obligations 

our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default which if not cured or waived could result in us being required to repay or refinance on less favorable terms these borrowings before their due date if we are forced to repay or refinance on less favorable terms these borrowings our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates in 2007 we were not in compliance with reporting covenants contained in some of the debt agreements of our subsidiaries such defaults under the reporting covenants were caused by our delay in producing our 2006 quarterly and audited annual consolidated financial statements we have obtained all necessary waivers under the agreements we can provide no assurance that we will comply in the future with all our reporting covenants and will not face an event of default under our debt agreements or that such default will be cured or waived 

work stoppages and other labor relations matters could adversely affect our results of operations 

currently approximately 3700 of our employees or approximately 51 of our total workforce are unionized and represented by 20 different unions approximately onefourth of our 76 union collective bargaining agreements expire annually with 18 agreements covering 982 employees scheduled to expire before the end of 2009 we might not be able to renegotiate labor contracts on terms that are favorable to us and negotiations or dispute resolutions undertaken in connection with our labor contracts could be delayed or become subject to the risk of labor actions or work stoppages labor actions work stoppages or the threat of work stoppages and our failure to obtain favorable labor contract terms during renegotiations may all adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and liquidity 

material weaknesses in the company’s internal controls over financial reporting existed during 2008 if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or on a timely basis any inability to report and file our financial results in an accurate and timely manner could harm our business and adversely impact the trading price of our common stock 

as a public company we are required to comply with the sarbanesoxley act and other rules and regulations that govern public companies in particular we will be required to certify our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act for the year ended december 31 2009 which requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles however from 2003 until the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008 we were an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe a stock corporation incorporated in the federal republic of germany and were not required to maintain a system of effective internal controls or comply with the requirements of the sec and the sarbanesoxley act nor to prepare our own consolidated financial statements as a public reporting company we are required among other things to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting suitable to prepare our publicly reported financial statements in a timely and accurate manner and also to evaluate and report on such system of internal control 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2006 we and our independent registered public accountants identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 each of these weaknesses could have resulted in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2008 we consider the control deficiency relating to the maintenance of contracts and agreements should remain as a material weakness until we have sufficient experience with the sustainability of the levels at which it has been operating this weakness could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements for further discussion see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—our internal control and remediation initiatives” moreover we cannot assure you that we have identified all or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses any of which may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and cause future delays in filing our financial statements and periodic reports with the sec any such delays in the filing of our financial statements and periodic reports may result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the sec we believe that such misstatements or delays could negatively impact our liquidity access to capital markets financial condition and the market value of our common stock or cause a downgrade in the credit ratings of american water or awcc

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend in 2001 cawc entered into a conservation agreement with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration which we refer to as noaa requiring cawc to implement certain measures to protect the steelhead trout and its habitat in the carmel river watershed study the removal of the san clemente dam and explore longterm water sources other than a new reservoir in the carmel river since that time cawc has implemented a number of measures to reduce the impact of its operations on the steelhead trout and other species and has begun the environmental review and permitting process for our coastal water project which is intended to provide an alternate water source for the monterey peninsula and in part to address some of the foregoing concerns relating to withdrawals from carmel river in early 2004 noaa informed cawc of its concern that cawc’s ongoing operations would cause the “take” of significant numbers of steelhead trout during the several remaining years required to implement the coastal water project in june 2006 cawc and noaa entered a settlement agreement whereby cawc agreed to fund certain additional projects to improve habitat conditions for and aid in the recovery of steelhead trout in the carmel river watershed under the settlement agreement cawc is required among other things to make an initial payment of 35 million plus six annual installments of 11 million the settlement agreement requires that all payments made by cawc to noaa be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed although we established a reserve for settlement payments no payments have been made to date because noaa had been unable to ensure that settlement payments will be used for mitigation projects in the carmel river watershed noaa has agreed not to assess any penalties or otherwise prosecute cawc for any “take” of steelhead trout so long as cawc complies with the settlement agreement in january 2009 the company and noaa agreed in principle to amend the settlement agreement to allow the required payments to be made to and managed by a california state agency under an existing mitigation program pending finalization of this amendment including agreement by the state agency the company expects to make its first payment of 35 million on april 1 2009 on march 14 2008 the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association notified cawc of their intent to file a citizen suit 60 days therefrom for violations of the federal endangered species act alleging the “take” of steelhead trout by cawc along the carmel river and seeking injunctive relief to reduce river water diversions and increase river flow and fish passage facilities no such suit was filed however the sierra club and the carmel river steelhead association recently filed an administrative complaint with the california state water resources control board claiming that certain fish passage facilities do not meet existing permit requirements cawc also undertakes activities to protect the threatened california redlegged frog and its habitat in the carmel river pursuant to a prior agreement with the us fish and wildlife service “usfws” this agreement is currently expired and cawc is in discussions with usfws to renew the agreement in addition the state water resource control board recently has held administrative hearings to address claims that cawc has exceeded its water diversion rights in the carmel river and has not diligently pursued establishing an alternative water supply as required by an administrative order issued to cawc by the state water resource control board in 1995 a decision in this matter is pending although cawc believes it has continued to comply with its obligations under the state water resource board’s 1995 order as well as the settlement agreement and cawc’s permit requirements we can not assure you that any future requirements by the state water resources control board arising from the matters currently before it or other permit modifications would not result in material additional costs or obligations to us 

in february 2004 the new jersey department of environmental protection which we refer to as njdep issued to njawc a notice of violation alleging that njawc had exceeded annual diversion limits contained in njaw’s water allocation permits for certain wells in our lakewood system during the years 2001 through 2003 

  

njdep initially assessed a penalty of 06 million njawc subsequently submitted a voluntary statewide self disclosure report identifying all such exceedances for the period of 1999 through 2003 in december 2007 njawc finalized an administrative consent order with njdep to resolve the above violations under which njawc has paid a civil fine of 01 million and has undertaken a 04 million environmental project which we currently expect to complete by the end of 2009 we have established a reserve for the project costs and we believe that njawc is operating in compliance with the applicable diversion limits in its water allocation permits 

cawc njawc and long island water corporation are each plaintiffs in lawsuits relating to contamination by methyl tertiary butyl ether which we refer to as mtbe and other gasoline additives in which they seek to recover cleanup and treatment costs and to protect certain of their groundwater supplies the defendants in these cases are oil and chemical companies that manufacture mtbe refine gasoline containing mtbe andor supply gasoline containing mtbe to retail gasoline stations the cases were consolidated with cases involving other plaintiffs in multidistrict litigation pending in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  in re methyl tertiary butyl ether products liability litigation  case no mdl 1358 sas as a result of courtordered mediation cawc njawc long island water corporation and the other plaintiffs agreed to settle the lawsuits with some of the named defendants who represent a significant portion of the total national refining capacity for mtbe under the settlement which was approved by the court in august 2008 cawc njawc and long island water corporation received payments after deducting attorneys’ fees and litigation expenses totaling approximately 154 million in the aggregate to treat wells that were contaminated by mtbe at the time of the settlement the settling defendants are obligated to pay a significant share of treatment costs for any wells that become contaminated by mtbe above certain concentration levels over the next 30 years cawc njawc and long island water corporation expect to continue to litigate their claims against other remaining defendants although we do not currently expect pending and future treatment costs for mtbe contamination to be material there can be no guarantee that cawc njawc or long island water corporation will be able to recover all of their respective costs relating to any past or future discovery of mtbe in their wells from any of the settling defendants by means of any pending or future litigation or through their rate cases 

terratec our canadian subsidiary is subject to and has been complying with an order by the ontario ministry of the environment which we refer to as moe issued on october 31 2006 requiring it to take steps to thicken certain biosolids that had been more susceptible to spillage during transport moe conducted an investigation and laid charges against terratec relating to four such transport spillage incidents involving terratec that occurred prior to the issuance of the order in december 2008 terratec and the moe agreed that terratec would pay a fine of cdn 300000 plus a 25 surcharge to resolve these charges

overview 

founded in 1886 american water is the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served our approximately 7300 employees provide drinking water wastewater and other waterrelated services to more than 15 million people in 32 states and ontario canada in 2008 we generated 23369 million in total operating revenue representing approximately four times the operating revenue of the next largest investorowned company in the united states water and wastewater business and 1869 million in operating loss which includes 7500 million of impairment charges relating to continuing operations and a net loss of 5624 million 

our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential commercial and industrial customers our regulated businesses that provide these services are generally subject to economic regulation by state pucs in the states in which they operate the federal government and the states also regulate environmental health and safety and water quality matters our regulated businesses currently provide services in 20 states and in 2008 served approximately 33 million customers or connections to our water and wastewater networks we report the results of this business in our regulated businesses segment for the year ended december 31 2008 regulated businesses generated 20827 million in operating revenue prior to intersegment eliminations representing 891 of our consolidated operating revenue 

we also provide services that are not subject to economic regulation by state pucs our nonregulated businesses include our 

 

  

  

 we report these results in our nonregulated businesses segment for the year ended december 31 2008 our nonregulated businesses generated 2722 million in operating revenue prior to intersegment eliminations 

  

history 

prior to being acquired by rwe in 2003 we were the largest publicly traded water utility company as measured by both operating revenue and population served in the united states in 2003 we were acquired by rwe and became a private company prior to the merger thames us holdings formerly an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe was the holding company for us and our regulated and unregulated subsidiaries throughout the united states and ontario canada the rwe acquisition resulted in certain changes in our business for example our operations and management were managed through thames water 

our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2006 reflects expense allocations for some central corporate functions historically provided to us by thames water including information systems human resources accounting and treasury activities and legal services these allocations reflect expenses specifically identifiable as relating to our business as well as our share of expenses allocated to us based on capital employed capital expenditures headcount revenues production volumes fixed costs environmental accruals or other methods management considers to be reasonable during our transition to a separate standalone company we have developed or obtained additional inhouse capabilities related to these functions and therefore there were no such expense allocations in 2008 or in 2007 from rwe or its affiliates we and rwe consider these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of our utilization of the services provided by thames water however our expenses as a separate standalone company may be higher or lower than the amounts reflected in our 2006 consolidated statements of operations also we agreed not to file rate cases with some state pucs for specified periods of time as a condition of the acquisition as of december 31 2007 all rate stayout provisions associated with the rwe acquisition had expired 

in 2005 rwe decided to divest american water in march 2006 rwe decided to divest american water through the sale of shares in one or more public offerings in order to become a public company once again we have had to incur substantial initial costs including costs associated with ensuring adequate internal control over financial reporting in order to achieve compliance with the sarbanesoxley act these substantial initial costs will not be recovered in rates charged to our customers see “—our internal control and remediation initiatives” 

upon the completion of our initial public offering in april 2008 we again became listed on the nyse rwe aqua holdings gmbh the selling stockholder sold approximately 632 million shares of the company’s common stock rwe currently owns approximately 60 of the company’s shares of common stock 

we performed valuations of our goodwill in 2008 2007 and 2006 as a result of the valuation analyses we recorded pretax charges of 7500 million 5093 million and 2278 million including impairment charges from discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

our internal control and remediation initiatives 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles however from 2003 to april 28 2008 we were an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of rwe and as a privately owned company were not required to comply with the requirements of the sec and the sarbanesoxley act or to prepare our own consolidated financial statements as a public reporting company we are required among other things to maintain a system of effective internal control over financial reporting suitable to prepare our publicly reported financial statements in a timely and accurate manner and also to evaluate and report on such system of internal control in particular we are required to certify our compliance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act for the year ended december 31 2009 which will require us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2006 we and our independent registered public accountants identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 since joining the company in 2006 donald l correll our chief executive officer and ellen c wolf our chief financial officer have assigned a high priority to the evaluation and remediation of our internal controls and have taken numerous steps to enhance these internal controls to a level that would prevent or detect a material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements and to implement an ongoing process to evaluate and strengthen our overall internal controls over financial reporting some of the actions taken to remediate these material weaknesses and to evaluate and strengthen our other internal controls over financial reporting include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 with respect to the material weaknesses described above we believe that we have addressed the areas of material weakness and have tested the effectiveness of controls designed to address these material weaknesses based on these actions and the length of time these controls have been operating at a level that would prevent or detect a material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements we no longer consider these control deficiencies to be material weaknesses as of december 31 2008 except for the control deficiencies relating to the maintenance of contracts and agreements which in our opinion should remain as a material weakness until we have sufficient experience with the sustainability of the levels at which it has been operating 

as of december 31 2008 the company had incurred 584 million to remediate these material weaknesses and to document and test key financial reporting controls at this time the company cannot indicate with certainty what additional costs may need to be incurred in the future as a condition to state puc approval of the rwe divestiture we agreed that costs incurred in connection with our initial internal control and remediation initiatives would not be recoverable in rates charged to our customers 

  

elements of our remediation activities can only be accomplished over time and our initiatives provide no assurances that they will result in an effective internal control environment our board of directors in coordination with our audit committee will continually assess the progress and sufficiency of these initiatives and make adjustments as necessary 

the company believes the additional control procedures as designed when implemented will fully remediate the material weaknesses described above 

factors affecting our results of operations 

as the largest investorowned united states water and wastewater utility company as measured both by operating revenue and population served our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by a variety of industrywide factors including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 since our acquisition by rwe in 2003 our results of operations have also been significantly influenced by goodwill impairments see “goodwill impairment” 

factors that may affect the results of operations of our regulated businesses’ operating performance are mitigated by state pucs granting us appropriate rate relief that is designed to allow us to recover prudently incurred expenses and to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment 

economic utility regulation 

our subsidiaries in the states in which we operate our regulated businesses are generally subject to extensive economic regulation by their respective state pucs although specific authority might differ from state to state in most states these state pucs must approve rates accounting treatments longterm financing programs significant capital expenditures and plant additions transactions between the regulated subsidiary and affiliated entities reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions in many instances prior to their completion regulatory policies not only vary from state to state they may change over time these policies will affect the timing as well as the extent of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital 

our operating revenue is typically determined by reference to the volume of water supplied to a customer multiplied by a pricepergallon set by a tariff approved by the relevant state puc the process to obtain approval for a change in rates or rate case involves filing a petition with the state puc on a periodic basis as determined by our capital expenditures needs and our operating costs rate cases and other raterelated proceedings can take several months to a year or more to complete therefore there is frequently a delay or regulatory lag between the time one of our regulated subsidiaries makes a capital investment or incurs an operating expense increase and when those costs are reflected in rates the management team at each of our regulated subsidiaries works to minimize regulatory lag 

our results of operations are significantly affected by rates authorized by the state pucs in the states in which we operate and we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with rate stayouts and delayed or 

  

inadequate rate recovery in addition to general rate case filings we generate revenues through other cost recovery procedures for example some states in which we operate allow utility subsidiaries to recover system infrastructure replacement costs without the necessity of filing a full rate proceeding since infrastructure replacement is a significant element of capital expenditures made by our subsidiaries such programs can reduce regulatory lag 

currently pennsylvania illinois missouri indiana new york california and ohio have allowed the use of these infrastructure surcharges these surcharges adjust periodically based on qualified capital expenditures being completed or anticipated in a future period these surcharges are typically reset to zero when new base rates are effective and incorporate the costs of these infrastructure expenditures in 2008 we have been granted an additional 180 million in revenues assuming constant sales volumes from such surcharges in several of our states furthermore we were granted a 06 million increase for an arsenic surcharge in our arizona subsidiary allowing recovery for costs associated with the construction and operation of arsenic treatment facilities 

also some of the states in which we operate permit passthrough provisions that allow for an increase in certain operating costs such as purchased power and property taxes to be passed on to and recovered from the customers outside of a general rate proceeding 

some states have permitted use of some form of forecast or forwardlooking test year instead of historical data to set rates examples of these states include hawaii illinois kentucky ohio pennsylvania new york tennessee and california in addition a number of states in which we operate have allowed the utility to update historical data for some changes that occur for some limited period of time subsequent to the historical test year this allows the utility to take account of some more current costs or capital investments in the ratesetting process examples of these states include new mexico texas missouri iowa virginia maryland west virginia new jersey and arizona 

another regulatory mechanism to address issues of regulatory lag includes the ability in some circumstances to recover in rates a return on utility plant before it is actually in service instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction examples of states that have allowed such recovery include texas pennsylvania ohio kentucky virginia and california 

the infrastructure surcharge passthrough provisions the forwardlooking test year and the allowance of a return on utility plant before it is actually in service are examples of mechanisms that present an opportunity to limit the risks associated with regulatory lag we employ each of these mechanisms as part of our rate case management program to ensure efficient recovery of our costs and investment and to ensure positive shortterm liquidity and longterm profitability 

in addition some states have permitted us to seek preapproval of certain capital projects and associated costs in this preapproval process the pucs assess the prudency of such projects 

as a condition to our acquisition by rwe in 2003 we agreed not to file rate cases in some of the states where our regulated businesses operate in 2008 we received authorizations for additional annualized revenues from general rate cases of 1877 million we are awaiting the final order for our hawaii general rate case that was filed in 2007 requesting 13 million in total additional annual revenues in october 2008 the hawaii public utility commission approved on an interim basis an increase in additional annualized revenues of 07 million the interim rates were effective for the fourth quarter of 2008 also at this time we are awaiting final orders in six states for general rate cases filed in 2008 requesting additional annualized revenues of 1027 million there is no assurance that the filed amount or any portion thereof of any requested increases will be granted 

infrastructure investment 

the water and wastewater utility industry is highly capital intensive we invested approximately 1 billion and 750 million in net companyfunded capital improvements in 2008 and 2007 respectively from 2009 to 

  

2013 we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 40 billion and 45 billion we anticipate spending between 790 million and 10 billion yearly on companyfunded capital investment for the foreseeable future depending upon the timing of major capital projects our capital investment includes both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace existing infrastructure as needed and construction of new facilities to meet customer growth from 2009 to 2013 we estimate we will invest approximately 13 billion to 14 billion to replace aging infrastructure including mains meters and supply and treatment facilities we estimate that we will invest approximately 12 billion to 13 billion in new facilities to serve customer growth over this same period in addition we estimate that complying with water quality standards and other regulatory requirements will require approximately 300 million to 400 million of investment projects to enhance system reliability quality of service and risk reduction are estimated to require an investment of approximately 800 million while efficiency related projects are estimated to require an investment of approximately 400 million to 600 million over this same period 

these capital investments are needed on an ongoing basis to comply with existing and new regulations renew aging treatment and network assets provide capacity for new growth and enhance system reliability security and quality of service the need for continuous investment presents a challenge due to the potential for regulatory lag or the delay in recovering our operating expenses and earning an appropriate rate of return on our invested capital and a return of our invested capital because the decisions of state pucs and the timing of those decisions can have a significant impact on the operations and earnings of our regulated businesses we maintain a rate case management program guided by the goals of obtaining efficient recovery of costs of capital and utility operation and maintenance costs including costs incurred for compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation as discussed above under “—economic utility regulation” we pursue methods to minimize the adverse impact of regulatory lag and have worked with state pucs and legislatures to implement a number of approaches to achieve this result including promoting the implementation of forms of forwardlooking test years and infrastructure surcharges

our water and wastewater operations are subject to extensive united states federal state and local and in the case of our canadian operations canadian laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment health and safety the quality of the water we deliver to our customers water allocation rights and the manner in which we collect treat discharge and dispose of wastewater these requirements include the safe drinking water act the clean water act and similar state and canadian laws and regulations we are also required to obtain various environmental permits from regulatory agencies for our operations state pucs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services we deliver we incur substantial costs associated with compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality regulation to which our regulated businesses are subject 

environmental health and safety and water quality regulations are complex and change frequently and the overall trend has been that they have become more stringent over time we face the risk that as newer or stricter standards are introduced they could increase our operating expenses in the past we have generally been able to recover expenses associated with compliance for environmental health and safety standards but this recovery is affected by regulatory lag and the corresponding uncertainties surrounding rate recovery 

production costs 

our water and wastewater services require significant production inputs and result in significant production costs these costs include fuel and power which is used to operate pumps and other equipment purchased water and chemicals used to treat water and wastewater we also incur production costs for waste disposal for 2008 production costs accounted for approximately 114 of our total operating costs price increases associated with these inputs impact our results of operations until rate relief is granted 

  

customer growth 

customer growth in our regulated businesses is driven by i organic population growth within our authorized service areas and ii by adding new customers to our regulated customer base by acquiring water and wastewater utility systems through acquisitions generally we add customers through tuckins of small water andor wastewater systems typically serving fewer than 10000 customers in close geographic proximity to where we currently operate our regulated businesses during 2008 2007 and 2006 we had cash outflows of 125 million 159 million and 125 million respectively for tuckin acquisitions of water and wastewater systems which allowed us to expand our regulated customer base we also seek larger acquisitions that allow us to acquire multiple water and wastewater utility systems in our existing markets and markets where we currently do not operate our regulated businesses our experienced development team evaluates potential acquisition targets across the country particularly in highergrowth areas before entering new markets we will evaluate the regulatory environment to ensure that we will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate return on our investment while maintaining our high standards for quality reliability and compliance with environmental health and safety and water quality standards these acquisitions may include large acquisitions of companies that have operations in multiple markets for further information see “business—growth” 

declining water usage per customer 

increased water conservation including through the use of more efficient household fixtures and appliances among residential consumers combined with declining household sizes in the united states has contributed to a trend of declining water usage per residential customer additionally in the current economic environment both industrial and commercial usage continues to decline 

the average annual decrease in residential water usage per customer from january 1999 through december 2008 as a percentage of january 1999 usage in the larger states served by our regulated businesses ranged from a decline 056 per year in new jersey at the low end to as high as 162 per year in west virginia the decline in industrial and commercial usage from 2007 to 2008 was 37 

because the characteristics of residential water use are driven by many factors including socioeconomic and other demographic characteristics of our service areas climate seasonal weather patterns and water rates these declining trends vary by state and service area and change over time the trend of declining residential water usage per customer is higher in the predominantly rural states served by our regulated businesses we do not believe that the trend in any particular state or region will have a disproportionate impact on our results of operations 

our regulated businesses are heavily dependent upon operating revenue generated from rates we charge to our customers for the volume of water they use declining usage due to conservation or economic environment will have a negative impact on our longterm operating revenues if we are unable to secure appropriate regulatory treatment to offset the usage decline 

water supply 

our ability to meet the existing and future water demands of our customers depends on an adequate supply of water drought governmental restrictions overuse of sources of water the protection of threatened species or habitats or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water also customer usage of water is affected by weather conditions in particular during the summer our water systems experience higher demand in the summer due to the warmer temperatures and increased usage by customers for lawn irrigation and other outdoor uses summer weather that is cooler and wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can have a downward effect on our operating revenue and operating income conversely when weather conditions are extremely dry and even if our water supplies are sufficient to serve our customers our systems may be affected by droughtrelated warnings andor water usage restrictions imposed by governmental agencies purchase supply allocation and mandatory conservation measures all of the above conditions serve to reduce customer demand and operating revenues these restrictions may be imposed at a regional or state level 

  

and may affect our service areas regardless of our readiness to meet unrestricted customer demands we employ a variety of measures to ensure that we have adequate sources of water supply both in the shortterm and over the longterm for additional detail concerning these measures see “business—our regulated businesses—overview of networks facilities and water supply” 

the geographic diversity of our service areas tends to mitigate some of the effect of weather extremes in any given summer some areas are likely to experience drier than average weather while other areas will experience wetter than average weather 

goodwill impairment 

at december 31 2008 the company’s goodwill totaled 16995 million the company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any in accordance with sfas no 142 the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values including goodwill on the measurement date if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

for the november 30 2008 impairment test the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques 

 

  

 the estimated fair values of the nonregulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models 

the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the regulated reporting unit’s historic and forecasted cash flows the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers 

the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s fiveyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts those cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital 

  

if step 2 of the impairment test is required the company determines the fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s assets and liabilities the fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying values however the fair values of the applicable debt are highly dependent upon market conditions surrounding the measurement date for the step 2 calculations of the fair value of debt the company uses observable prices of instruments and indices that have risks similar to those instruments being valued adjusted to compensate for differences in credit profile collateral tax treatment and call features to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit’s debt 

the company has completed its november 30 2008 annual impairment review and does not believe that the company’s goodwill balance was impaired however there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

in making the determination we considered both qualitative and quantitative factors including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the company’s market capitalization as such the company believes that the current evaluation technique is more appropriate than relying solely on the current trading market value of the company’s common stock 

in reaching our conclusion we also made certain assumptions which we believe to be appropriate that support the fair value of our reporting units we considered in addition to the listed trading price of the company’s shares the effect on that price due to rwe’s majority ownership the effect of rwe’s expected disposition of its owned company shares on the market for those shares the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate as a result we concluded that the company’s fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone 

in addition given recent market conditions management determined that it was appropriate for the company to consider the average of the company’s closing market price over a thirty day period rather than using a particular date to calculate its market capitalization the company’s calculated market capitalization within its 2008 impairment test period was approximately 9400 million below the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units 

the difference between our calculated market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units which approximates book value resulted from the estimated control premium and the estimated impact to the company’s market capitalization from the overhang created by rwe’s announced plans to divest a substantial portion of its ownership through further public offerings of stock 

the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling majority interest in the company in estimating the control premium management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace 

the estimated stock overhang represents the impact on the company’s share price that we believe results from investor concerns over market price dilution due to the anticipated increase in the number of the company’s publicly traded shares caused by the anticipated rwe sale of the company’s stock as a condition of certain state regulator approvals for rwe’s sale of the company rwe had agreed to sell 100 of its holdings of 

  

company stock by april 2010 and previously announced its intentions to reduce its interest to below 50 prior to the end of 2008 management estimated the impact of this overhang condition using reports from multiple analysts covering the company’s stock and other available market information 

the determination of our estimated fair value required the exercise of judgment and is highly sensitive to our assumptions our estimated fair values approximate the carrying value of reporting units leaving little estimated value in excess of the required threshold of the step 1 test had the fair value been less than the carrying value of the reporting units differences between the carrying value and fair value of our longterm debt which is not taken into account in step 1 but is required in step 2 would have increased any impairment charge indicated by step 1 by an estimated 300 million due to accounting guidance that must be followed to measure the implied fair value of goodwill 

for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill including discontinued operations in the amount of 7500 million 5093 million and 2278 million respectively 

as of march 31 2008 in light of the initial public offering price and trading levels in our common stock subsequent to the date of the initial public offering the company performed an interim impairment test and on may 9 2008 management concluded that the carrying value of the company’s goodwill was impaired the company believed that the initial public offering price was indicative of the value of the company at march 31 2008 and accordingly based on those factors recorded an impairment charge to the goodwill of its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 7500 million as of march 31 2008 the impairment charge was primarily attributed to the market price of the company’s common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than the estimate of the initial public offering price used during the 2007 annual test also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company’s debt due to increased market interest rates as a result of the impairment charge rwe aqua holdings gmbh a whollyowned subsidiary of rwe transferred 2450 million to the company on may 13 2008 this cash was used to reduce shortterm debt rwe is not obligated to make any additional capital contributions 

during the third quarter of 2007 as a result of the company’s debt being placed on review for a possible downgrade and the proposed sale of a portion of the company in the initial public offering management determined at that time it was appropriate to update its valuation analysis before the next scheduled annual test based on this assessment the company performed an interim impairment test and recorded an impairment charge to goodwill related to its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 2433 million as of september 30 2007 the decline was primarily due to a slightly lower longterm earnings forecast caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery 

the company completed its scheduled annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined that an impairment had occurred based upon information regarding the company’s market value in connection with the initial public offering management determined that the indicative fair value of the company based on estimates of the initial public offering price range was the best evidence of the company’s market value and incorporated this indicated market value into the company’s valuation methodology which also considered other items such as peer multiples discounted cash flows and a control premium based on the results of the impairment test an impairment of 2660 million to the company’s carrying value was recognized as of december 31 2007 

the 2006 impairment charge of 2278 million was attributable to higher interest rates in the regulated reporting unit and a change in the potential net realizable value of a nonregulated reporting unit 

economic environment 

continued market disruption could cause a broad economic downturn this downturn could lead to increased incidence of customers’ failure to pay for services delivered as well as a decreased usage by our industrial and commercial customers 

  

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statement of operations data for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

   

the following table summarizes certain financial information for our regulated and nonregulated businesses for the periods indicated without giving effect to intersegment eliminations 

 

  

 our primary business involves the ownership of water and wastewater utilities that provide services to residential commercial and industrial customers as such our results of operations are significantly impacted by rates authorized by the state regulatory commissions in the states in which we operate the table below details the annualized revenues including step increases resulting from rate authorizations and infrastructure charges which were granted in 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 the effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2008 were december 8 2008 november 28 2008 and august 8 2008 in new jersey missouri and illinois respectively the effective dates for the larger rate increases granted in 2007 were march 30 2007 november 30 2007 and october 22 2007 in new jersey pennsylvania and missouri respectively the change in annualized rate increases granted between 2006 and 2007 can be attributed to the removal of the stayout provisions and increased investment in our regulated infrastructure programs 

  

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

operating revenues our operating revenues increased by 1227 million or 55 to 23369 million for 2008 from 22142 million for 2007 regulated businesses’ revenues increased by 952 million or 48 for 2008 compared to 2007 the nonregulated businesses’ revenues for 2008 increased by 295 million or 122 from 2007 

the increase in the regulated businesses’ revenues was primarily due to rate increases obtained through general rate cases totaling approximately 1328 million as well as higher revenues resulting from surcharges of 45 million and from customer growth and acquisitions of approximately 33 million this increase was offset by a 523 million decrease in revenues related to lower customer consumption mainly in our states in the midwestern region of the united states primarily due to the extremely wet weather conditions in those areas during 2008 as well as decreased usage in 2008 compared to 2007 in new jersey and pennsylvania mainly due to drier weather conditions in 2007 

our nonregulated businesses’ operating revenues increased by 295 million or 122 to 2722 million in 2008 from 2427 for 2007 the net increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues in our contract operations group and our homeowner services group partially offset by decreased revenues in our applied water management group and canadian fixed residuals the increase in contract operations group revenues was primarily attributable to incremental revenues associated with design and build contracts as well as increased military construction and om project revenues the increase from our homeowner service group represented increased product penetration within its existing customer base applied water management group revenues were lower than the prior year as a result of the decline in design and build activity resulting from the downturn in new home construction 

the following table sets forth the amounts and percentages of regulated businesses’ revenues and water sales volume by customer class 

 

 water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2008 increased 516 million or 45 from 2007 primarily due to rate increases offset by a decrease in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers decreased by 93 billion gallons or 42 from 2007 largely as a result of wetter weather conditions in california and the midwestern region of the united states in 2008 and drier weather conditions in new jersey and pennsylvania in 2007 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2008 increased by 183 million or 48 mainly due to rate increases offset by decreases in sales volume compared to 2007 the volume of water sold to commercial customers decreased by 31 billion gallons or 33 from 2007 

  

water service operating revenues from industrial customers for 2008 increased 70 million or 74 from 2007 mainly due to rate increases offset by decreased sales volume that we believe were caused by the downturn in the economy the volume of water sold to industrial customers decreased 26 billion gallons or 58 from 2007 

water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 81 million or 33 from 2007 mainly due to rate increases revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 1043 million for 2008 an increase of 50 million from 2007 revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2008 totaled 1513 million an increase of 31 million from 2007 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 12 states revenues from these services for 2008 increased by 43 million or 57 from 2007 the increase was attributable to increases in rates charged to customers principally in arizona new jersey and pennsylvania 

operation and maintenance operation and maintenance expense increased 573 million or 46 for 2008 compared to 2007 

operation and maintenance expense for the 2008 and 2007 by major expense category were as follows 

 

 production costs increased by 105 million or 38 for 2008 compared to 2007 production costs by major expense type were as follows 

 

 the increase in fuel and power costs was primarily due to higher electricity prices purchased water costs were higher as a result of rate increases resulting from higher costs incurred by our suppliers the increase in chemical costs were attributable to rising prices as well as additional usage requirements related to fluctuating raw water quality caused by weather conditions in some of the states in which we operate 

  

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and pension expense increased 422 million or 91 for 2008 compared to 2007 these employeerelated costs represented 388 and 372 of operation and maintenance expenses for 2008 and 2007 respectively 

 

 salaries and wages increased 237 million and 51 million in our regulated and nonregulated businesses respectively these increases primarily resulted from stockbased compensation expense of 37 million mainly attributable to the issuance of awards granted in connection with the initial public offering 43 million of wages related to job reclassification of certain hourly employees for services performed and from an increase in the number of employees primarily as a result of enhancing customer service and inflationary wage rate increases the increase in pension expense was primarily due to an increase in our regulated businesses’ pension expense of 91 million or 251 for 2008 over 2007 pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by certain of our regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates as contributions are made to the plans although our pension expense calculated in accordance with sfas 87 remained relatively unchanged pension expense increased for 2008 due to increased contributions by certain of our regulated operating companies whose costs are recovered based on the company’s funding policy which is to fund at least the minimum amount required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 which we refer to as erisa rather than the sfas 87 expense the increase in the contributions is attributable to a change in the discount rate and lower than expected returns on plan assets medical benefit expenses for employees increased due to an increase in the number of employees and the rising cost of health care other benefits increased primarily as a result of increased salaries and wages which in turn resulted in increased company contribution to the 401k and defined contribution plans also other benefit expenses increased due to the benefit expense related to the new employee stock purchase plan 

operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation legal and other professional services as well as information systems and other office equipment rental charges for 2008 these costs decreased by 102 million or 35 compared to 2007 

 

 contracted services increased in 2008 compared to the same period in 2007 this increase was primarily due to higher contracted services in our contract operations group in 2008 as compared to 2007 associated with several operating contracts including a dbo project in fillmore california offsetting this increase were lower consulting fees associated with our remediation efforts to comply with sarbanesoxley act of 2002 these costs decreased by 

  

226 million to 94 million in 2008 from 320 million in 2007 other operating supplies and services were lower in 2008 as 2007 costs were higher due to a writeoff of certain deferred costs totaling 11 million by our new jersey subsidiary as they were no longer deemed recoverable additionally our nonregulated businesses recorded loss contingencies of 36 million in 2007 other decreases are associated with the cost of materials primarily related to our contract operations group due to changes in project work performed 

maintenance materials and services which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance increased 83 million or by 65 for 2008 compared to 2007 

 

 our regulated businesses’ maintenance materials and service costs increased by 68 million in 2008 mainly due to increased costs of 17 million associated with a program in illinois to maintain valves and fire hydrants and higher cost of removal expenses of 55 million in certain of our operating companies partially offset by lower paving costs of 14 million in our new jersey and missouri operating companies the nonregulated businesses’ maintenance and services expenses increased by 17 million as a result of higher frequency of claims primarily resulting from the increase in the number of customer contracts with the service line protection program in our homeowner services group as well as from increased costs associated with the contract operations group mainly due to costs associated with new military operations and maintenance projects 

customer billing and accounting expenses increased by 58 million or 150 for 2008 compared to 2007 

 

 the increase was primarily the result of higher uncollectible accounts expense in our regulated businesses of 06 million and in our nonregulated businesses of 29 million primarily due to increased uncollectible expense in the applied water management group of 18 million primarily due to the collection of 12 million in 2007 for an amount that was previously writtenoff as well as higher uncollectible expense in our contract operation group in addition postage expense increased in our regulated subsidiaries 09 million compared to 2007 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 08 million or 18 for 2008 compared to 2007 

 

   

insurance expense decreased due to more favorable claims experience in 2008 compared to 2007 regulatory expenses increased primarily due to writeoffs of deferred rate case expenses primarily in tennessee illinois california and ohio as well as increased rate case amortization costs associated with rate cases settled in 2007 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by 39 million or 15 for 2008 compared to 2007 this increase was primarily due to additional assets placed in service mainly in our regulated businesses over the last year 

general taxes general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items increased by 159 million or 87 in 2008 compared to 2007 this increase is primarily due to increased gross receipts taxes of 79 million primarily in new jersey and missouri and higher property tax expense of 42 million primarily in ohio and missouri additionally payroll taxes increased by 27 million due to increased salaries and wages and higher payroll tax limits 

gain on sale of assets the gain on sale of assets was 04 million for 2008 compared to a gain of 73 million for 2007 the gains in 2008 and 2007 are primarily attributable to nonrecurring sales of assets no longer used in our operations 

impairment charge the impairment charge was 7500 million for 2008 compared to 5093 million for 2007 the 2008 impairment charge was primarily due to the market price of the company’s common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than what was anticipated during our 2007 annual test also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company’s debt due to increased interest rates the 2007 impairment charge to goodwill to our regulated businesses was primarily due to slightly lower longterm earnings forecast caused by our updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery see “factors affecting our results of operations—goodwill impairment” 

other income deductions interest expense net of interest income the primary component of our other income deductions increased by 20 million or 07 for 2008 compared to 2007 the increase is primarily due to increased borrowings associated with capital expenditures offsetting the change in interest expense is an increase in afudc of 115 million for 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of increased construction activity in 2008 over 2007 amortization of debt expense increased 10 million for 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of debt restructuring other items contributing to the change include lower miscellaneous income for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result our indiana subsidiary now accounting for certain income in operating revenues in accordance with a 2007 rate order 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 250 million or 288 to 1118 million for 2008 from 868 million for 2007 

net income loss the net loss for 2008 was 5624 million compared to a net loss of 3428 million for 2007 the variation between the periods is the result of the aforementioned changes 

comparison of results of operations for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 

operating revenues our consolidated operating revenues increased 1211 million or 58 to 22142 for 2007 from 20931 million for 2006 an increase in operating revenues for our regulated businesses of 1329 million in 2007 was somewhat offset by a decrease in operating revenues for our nonregulated businesses of 58 million the increase in the regulated businesses’ operating revenues was primarily due to rate increases of approximately 619 million obtained through general rate cases in new jersey ohio arizona california and other states in addition rate increases obtained through infrastructurerelated provisions in pennsylvania missouri illinois and indiana totaled approximately 155 million water service operating 

  

revenues also increased due to growth of 07 in our regulated businesses’ customer base through small acquisitions in our service areas and through growth in existing service areas water sales volume associated with existing customers increased by 15 in 2007 compared to the prior year due to dry weather mainly in new jersey and pennsylvania 

the following table sets forth the percentage of our regulated businesses’ operating revenues and water sales volume by customer class 

 

 water services —water service operating revenues from residential customers for 2007 amounted to 11461 million a 73 increase over 2006 primarily due to rate increases and changes in sales volume the volume of water sold to residential customers increased by 29 in 2007 to 2234 billion gallons from 2172 billion gallons in 2006 largely as a result of favorable weather conditions in the midatlantic states and a 07 increase in the residential customer base due to growth primarily through acquisitions 

water service operating revenues from commercial water customers for 2007 amounted to 3853 million a 62 increase over 2006 primarily due to rate increases and changes in sales volume the volume of water sold to commercial customers increased by 16 in 2007 to 930 billion gallons from 916 billion gallons in 2006 driven by favorable weather conditions and partially offset by a decline in the number of commercial customers 

water service operating revenues from industrial customers amounted to 947 million in 2007 a 29 increase over 2006 primarily due to rate increases and changes in sales volume the volume of water sold to industrial customers increased by 05 in 2007 to 446 billion gallons from 444 billion gallons in 2006 

water service operating revenues from public and other customers increased 174 million for 2007 to 2476 million from 2302 million for 2006 mainly due to rate increases and changes in sales volume revenues from municipal governments for fire protection services and customers requiring special private fire service facilities totaled 993 million for 2007 an increase of 08 million over the same period of 2006 revenues generated by sales to governmental entities and resale customers for 2007 totaled 1483 million an increase of 166 million from 2006 

wastewater services —our subsidiaries provide wastewater services in 12 states operating revenues from these services increased by 47 to 756 million for 2007 the increase reflects a growth of 04 in the number of wastewater customers served but is primarily due to increases in rates charged to customers in states where we have wastewater operations principally arizona hawaii and new jersey 

our nonregulated revenues decreased by 58 million or 23 to 2427 million in 2007 from 2485 million for 2006 the net decline in revenues is primarily attributable to a 158 million decrease in 

  

revenues of our contract operations group partially offset by a 74 million increase in revenues of our homeowner services group and an increase of 35 million from our other nonregulated businesses the decline in revenues of our contract operations group includes the effects of having substantially completed the construction of the lake pleasant water treatment plant a large water treatment plant in phoenix arizona during 2006 495 million of construction revenue recognized in 2006 compared to 52 million in 2007 pursuant to our dbo contract with the city of phoenix we served as the lead contractor in connection with the construction of the lake pleasant facility which includes an 80 million gallonsperday surface water treatment plant and granular activated carbon reactivation system the lake pleasant facility is significantly larger in size and function compared to other projects with which we have been engaged however we do not expect the completion of this project to have a material impact on our results of operations revenues from that project were partially replaced by new contracts including a dbo project in fillmore california generating 123 million of incremental revenues and new military projects generating approximately 100 million of revenues the increase from our homeowner services group represents expansion into new geographic markets virginia and trenton new jersey the increase in our other nonregulated businesses’ revenues is due to revenues attributable to special projects in 2007 

operation and maintenance our consolidated operation and maintenance expense increased by 719 million or 61 to 12465 million for 2007 from 11745 million for 2006 

operation and maintenance expense by major category was as follows 

 

 production costs including fuel and power purchased water chemicals and waste disposal increased by 203 million or 79 for 2007 compared to 2006 

 

 the increases were primarily attributable to increased demand and higher electricity prices as rate freezes resulting from electricity deregulation expired in some states in which we operate 

  

employeerelated costs including wage and salary group insurance and pension expense increased by 446 million or 106 for 2007 compared to 2006 these costs represented 372 and 357 of operation and maintenance expense for 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 

 the increase in 2007 was due to higher wage salary and group insurance expenses in our regulated businesses primarily resulting from an increase in the number of employees to enable service enhancements in our regulated businesses as well as wage rate increases this increase was offset by a reduction in pension expense pension expense in excess of the amount contributed to the pension plans is deferred by some of our regulated subsidiaries pending future recovery in rates as contributions are made to the plans the decrease is primarily attributable to lower pension expense in 2007 in addition pension expense for 2006 included additional pension expense due to curtailment charges and a special transaction benefit charge 

operating supplies and services include the daytoday expenses of office operation legal and other professional services as well as information systems and other office equipment facilities rental charges and other miscellaneous expenses for 2007 these costs increased by 21 million or 07 compared to 2006 

 

 the decrease in contracted services is primarily associated with the design and build of the lake pleasant water treatment plant in phoenix arizona in 2006 these costs were approximately 387 million compared to 43 million in 2007 additionally the decrease reflects operating contracts of our nonregulated businesses that ended during 2006 and a decline in design and build activity by the applied water management group of 34 million due to a downturn in new home construction offsetting these decreases were additional expenses associated with several other contracts in our nonregulated businesses including a dbo project in fillmore totaling 76 million in 2007 compared to 04 million in 2006 as well as increased military contract expenses of 61 million also offsetting the decrease were consulting fees associated with our remediation efforts in connection with the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 these costs increased 151 million over 2006 office supplies and services increased as a result of increased travel as well as inflation transportation costs increased primarily within our regulated businesses due to increased leasing costs and higher gasoline prices amounting to approximately 32 million other operating supplies and services decreased primarily as a result of the aforementioned nonregulated contracts with lake pleasant costs of 08 million in 2007 compared to 101 million in 2006 and fillmore dbo costs of 48 million in 2007 compared to 02 million in 2006 offsetting these decreases was a 2006 restatement by our indiana subsidiary of 24 million previously disallowed in the regulatory process additional expenses related to the rwe divesture were 08 million higher for 2007 than 2006 due to higher divesture support costs 

  

maintenance materials and services which include emergency repairs as well as costs for preventive maintenance increased by 182 million or 166 for 2007 compared to 2006 

 

 these increases were primarily the result of a larger number of main breaks in 2007 compared to 2006 experienced by several of our operating subsidiaries due to winter weather conditions increased paving costs for our new jersey missouri illinois and pennsylvania subsidiaries as well as higher expenses in our nonregulated businesses primarily the homeowner services group 

customer billing and accounting expenses decreased by 164 million or 300 for 2007 compared to 2006 

 

 the decrease was primarily due to lower bad debt expense of 92 million in our regulated business and 58 million in our nonregulated businesses as a result of an increased focus on collection of past due accounts 

other operation and maintenance expenses include casualty and liability insurance premiums and regulatory costs these costs increased by 31 million or 73 for 2007 compared to 2006 

 

 insurance related expenses increased due to less favorable claims experience compared to 2006 this unfavorable variance was offset by a reduction in regulatory expenses due to the writeoff of certain deferred rate case expenses in 2006 associated with our california subsidiary 

depreciation and amortization our consolidated depreciation and amortization expense increased 81 million or 31 to 2673 million for 2007 from 2592 million for 2006 the increase was primarily due to property placed in service net of retirements of 7988 million as a result of an increased focus on infrastructure spending mainly in our regulated businesses 

  

general taxes our consolidated general taxes expense which includes taxes for property payroll gross receipts and other miscellaneous items decreased 18 million or 10 to 1833 million for 2007 from 1851 million for 2006 the decrease was primarily due to lower taxes for expatriates because employees seconded by thames water to american water were no longer employed by american water in 2007 

loss gain on sale of assets our consolidated gain on sale of assets was 73 million for 2007 compared to a loss of 01 million for 2006 due to nonrecurring sales of assets not needed in our utility operations in 2007 

impairment charges our consolidated impairment charges were 5093 million for 2007 and 2217 million excluding discontinued operations for 2006 the 2007 impairment charges were primarily due to slightly lower longterm earnings caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery as well as new information regarding our market value the 2006 impairment charge was primarily attributable to higher interest rates in our regulated businesses and a change in the potential net realizable value of our nonregulated businesses 

other income deductions interest expense the primary component of our consolidated other income deductions decreased 828 million or 226 to 2832 million for 2007 from 3660 million for 2006 the decline was primarily due to the repayment of outstanding debt with new equity contributions from rwe in order to establish a capital structure that is consistent with other regulated utilities and also to meet the capital structure expectations of various state regulatory commissions this decrease was offset slightly by higher interest expense of our regulated businesses of 98 million mainly due to increased borrowings to fund capital programs 

provision for income taxes our consolidated provision for income taxes increased 399 million or 851 to 868 million for 2007 from 469 million for 2006 the increase is due to higher taxable income in 2007 as compared to 2006 

net income loss our consolidated net loss including results from discontinued operations increased 1806 million or 1113 to 3428 million for 2007 from 1622 million for 2006 the increase is the result of the changes discussed above 

liquidity and capital resources 

our business is capital intensive and requires considerable capital resources a portion of these capital resources are provided by internally generated cash flows from operations when necessary we obtain funds from external sources in the capital markets and through bank borrowings our access to external financing on reasonable terms depends on our credit ratings and current business conditions including that of the water utility industry in general as well as conditions in the debt or equity capital markets if these business and market conditions deteriorate to the extent that we no longer have access to the capital markets at reasonable terms we have access to revolving credit facilities with aggregate bank commitments of 8500 million that we currently utilize to fulfill our shortterm liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit see “—credit facilities and shortterm debt” 

in addition our regulated utility subsidiaries receive advances and contributions from customers home builders and real estate developers to fund construction necessary to extend service to new areas advances for construction are refundable for limited periods which vary according to state regulations as new customers begin to receive service or other contractual obligations are fulfilled amounts which are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions in aid of construction utility plant funded by advances and contributions is excluded from the rate base generally we depreciate contributed property and amortize contributions in aid of construction at the composite rate of the related property some of our subsidiaries do not depreciate contributed property based on regulatory guidelines 

  

we use our capital resources including cash to i fund capital requirements including construction expenditures ii pay off maturing debt iii pay dividends iv fund pension and postretirement welfare obligations and v invest in new and existing ventures we spend a significant amount of cash on construction projects that have a longterm return on investment additionally we operate in rateregulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited and where such recovery takes place over an extended period of time as our recovery is subject to regulatory lag see “business—regulation—economic regulation” as a result of these factors our working capital defined as current assets less current liabilities was in a net deficit position as of december 31 2008 

we expect to fund future maturities of longterm debt through a combination of external debt and cash flow from operations we have no plans to reduce debt significantly 

we rely on our revolving credit facility and the capital markets to satisfy our liquidity needs disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from meeting their existing lending commitments extending the terms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments market disruptions may also limit our ability to issue debt securities in the capital markets on september 15 2008 we sought to issue commercial paper but were unable to consummate the issuance due to adverse market conditions in order to meet our shortterm liquidity needs we are borrowing under our existing 8400 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire on september 15 2012 on september 15 2008 a majority of our lenders agreed to extend 6850 million of commitments under this revolving credit facility to september 15 2013 awcc had 3450 million of outstanding borrowings and 439 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 23 2009 awcc had 1785 million of outstanding overnight commercial paper as of february 23 2009 we can provide no assurances that our lenders will meet their existing commitments or that we will be able to access the commercial paper or loan markets in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 

as of december 31 2008 the company had issued through its subsidiaries 1203 million of variable rate demand bonds which are periodically remarketed we can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates bonds totaling 249 million are issued by illinois american water bonds totaling 86 million are issued by arizona american water and the remaining 869 million of bonds are issued by awcc during the months of january and february 2009 awcc purchased its variable rate demand bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates although buyers periodically purchased the bonds from awcc at market rates during january and february 2009 at february 23 2009 awcc holds all 1203 million in treasury since the debt has been remarketed for periods no longer than one week and the company cannot be certain remarketing will be successful the debt is included in current portion of longterm debt at december 31 2008 

on february 17 2009 the president signed the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of 2009 which we refer to as the act into law the act contains various tax provisions including many that will provide benefits to the taxexempt bond market there are provisions modifying the rules for certain classes of taxexempt bonds which may enhance the marketability of the company’s tax exempt bonds additionally the act makes available 4 billion for capitalized grants for clean water state revolving funds and 2 billion for capitalized grants under the safe drinking water act states will reallocate these funds to subsidize eligible projects and the company intends to apply for this subsidized financing in a number of states in which it operates since the issuance of taxexempt bonds and financing from state revolving funds is subject to governmental approvals at this time we are not certain how much of these funds if any will be available to investor owned utilities 

in addition we believe we will be able to avail ourselves of the following tax provisions of the act 

 

  

 there can be no assurances of our ability to take advantage of these new provisions and any expected benefits to us are uncertain 

  

cash flows from operating activities 

cash flows from operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and due to the seasonality of operations are weighted toward the third quarter of each fiscal year our future cash flows from operating activities will be affected by economic utility regulation infrastructure investment inflation compliance with environmental health and safety standards production costs customer growth declining per customer usage of water and weather and seasonality see “—factors affecting our results of operations” 

cash flows from operating activities have been a reliable steady source of cash flow sufficient to meet operating requirements and a portion of our capital expenditures requirements we will seek access to debt and equity capital markets to meet the balance of our capital expenditure requirements there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully access such markets on favorable terms or at all operating cash flows can be negatively affected by changes in our rate regulatory environments or changes in our customer economic outlook and ability to pay for service in a timely manner we can provide no assurance that our customers’ historical payment pattern will continue in the future 

during 2008 the company’s unfunded status of its pension plan increased significantly primarily due to lower than expected 2008 asset returns which are expected to result in increased benefit costs and required funding contributions in future years such an increase is likely to be material to results in 2009 and subsequent years based on current plan assets and expected future asset returns the company currently estimates the increase to pension and postretirement expense net of capitalized amounts in 2009 to be approximately 32 million pretax it is the company’s intent to work with pucs in the states in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of operations the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1259 million 1325 million 1247 million 1619 million and 1232 million in 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates 

the following table provides a summary of the major items affecting our cash flows from operating activities for the periods indicated 

 

  

  the increase in cash flows from operations during 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to increased revenues partially offset by higher contributions to our pension and postretirement healthcare trusts 

the increase in cash flows from operations during 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to improvements in working capital mainly driven by changes in taxes accrued and other current liabilities slightly offset by changes in accounts receivable and unbilled utility revenues 

we intend to make 1281 million of contributions to our pension and postretirement benefit trusts during 2009 this increase was primarily caused by the impact of the significant decline in trust asset values during 

  

2009 through february 2009 we have made contributions to fund pension and other postretirement benefits of 171 and 104 million respectively 

cash flows from investing activities 

cash flows used in investing activities were as follows for the periods indicated 

 

  

 cash flows used in investing activities increased in 2008 compared to 2007 and in 2007 compared to 2006 as we continued to increase our investment in regulated infrastructure projects from 2009 to 2013 we estimate that companyfunded capital investment will total between 40 billion and 45 billion we anticipate spending between 790 million and 10 billion yearly on companyfunded capital investment for the foreseeable future depending upon the timing of major capital projects we expect construction expenditures to be approximately 800 million during 2009 we intend to invest capital prudently to provide essential services to our regulated customer base while working with regulators in the various states in which we operate to have the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on our investment and a return of our investment as part of our strategy to improve operational efficiencies we are evaluating our processes along with the information systems associated with those processes to optimize workflow throughout our field operations as well as streamlining our backoffice operations as we believe are necessary and appropriate when we make adjustments to our operations we will incur incremental expenses including costs to upgrade or replace outdated information systems prior to realizing the benefit of a more efficient workforce and operating structure we believe that increasing our operating efficiency and controlling the costs associated with the operation of our business are important to providing the quality service to our customers and communities we serve as well as to our longterm competitiveness we are currently developing a timeline for the implementation of this strategic initiative but expect that it will span a period of three to five years the details including scope cost and implementation of these solutions will not be fully known until the data gathering phase has been completed which is targeted for december 2009 expenditures associated with this project are included in the 40 billion to 45 billion capital investment spending outlined above 

our infrastructure investment plan consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and major capital investment projects where we will construct new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities our projected capital expenditures and other investments are subject to periodic review and revision to reflect changes in economic conditions and other factors 

the following table provides a summary of our historical construction expenditures 

 

   

construction expenditures for the periods noted above were partially offset by customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds of 31 million 358 million and 474 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively customer advances and contributions are reflected in net cash flows from financing activities capital expenditures during the periods noted above were related to the renewal of supply and treatment assets new water mains and customer service lines as well as rehabilitation of existing water mains and hydrants 

construction expenditures for 2008 increased by 2580 million or 344 over 2007 expenditures related to transmission and distribution increased by 1239 million in 2008 over 2007 and meter and fire hydrant replacements increased by 442 million in 2008 compared to 2007 these increases occurred due to an increase in the rate of infrastructure replacement treatment and pumping expenditures increased by 339 million in 2008 compared to 2007 as a result of significant treatment improvements in a number of states in which we operate including kentucky illinois and arizona 

on april 25 2008 the kentucky public service commission approved kentuckyamerican water company’s application for a certificate of convenience and necessity to construct a 200 million gallon per day treatment plant on the kentucky river and a 306 mile pipeline to meet central kentucky’s water supply deficit the kentucky project is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 with an estimated cost of 162 million 

construction expenditures for 2007 increased by 679 million or 100 over 2006 the increase consisted mainly of infrastructure replacements and upgrades to treatment facilities at several plants including joplin missouri maricopa county arizona franklin township new jersey and champaign illinois 

our construction program consists of both infrastructure renewal programs where we replace infrastructure as needed and construction of new water and wastewater treatment and delivery facilities to meet new customer growth an integral aspect of our strategy is to seek growth through tuckins and other acquisitions which are complementary to our existing business and support the continued geographical diversification and growth of our operations generally acquisitions are funded initially with shortterm debt and later refinanced with the proceeds from longterm debt or equity offerings 

we also conduct ongoing reviews of our existing investments as a result of these reviews we sold the operations of various nonregulated waterrelated businesses during 2006 and 2007 

the following provides a summary of the major acquisitions and dispositions affecting our cash flows from investing activities in the years indicated 

2008 

 

  

 2007 

 

   

  

 2006 

 

  

 our investing activities require considerable capital resources which we have generated in operations and attained through financing activities we can provide no assurances that these resources will be sufficient to meet our expected investment needs and may be required to delay or reevaluate our investment plans 

during 2007 njawc entered into an agreement with the city of trenton new jersey to purchase the assets of the city’s water system located in four surrounding townships the agreement required approval from the new jersey puc the initial proposed purchase price of 1000 million was subsequently amended to 750 million in addition the agreement has been amended to include the provision of technical services from the city over seven years to ensure a smooth transition of ownership at a cost of 50 million the administrative law judge hearing the matter has issued an initial decision approving the stipulation and sent the initial decision to the new jersey puc for consideration on february 25 2009 a petition seeking a referendum was filed with the city of trenton the petition seeks to force the city council to reconsider its prior approval of the sale and a vote as to whether the ordinance approving the sale of the system should go forward or to be negated the company can provide no assurance as to the outcome of the referendum nor can we provide assurance that the initial decision will ultimately be approved by the new jersey puc included in the stipulation and dependent upon final approval the company intends to purchase finished water from the city of trenton for the next twenty years under a water supply agreement the acquisition is expected to add approximately forty thousand customers to the company’s customer base 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities whose primary purpose is to fund construction expenditures include the issuance of longterm and shortterm debt primarily through our whollyowned financing subsidiary awcc we intend to access the capital markets on a regular basis subject to market conditions in addition we have received capital contributions from rwe and intend to issue equity in the future to maintain an appropriate capital structure subject to any restrictions in the registration rights agreement between us and rwe in order to finance new infrastructure we received customer advances and contributions for construction net of refunds of 31 million 358 million and 474 million for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 2006 respectively in february 2009 awcc completed its public offering of 750 million of 825 senior notes with a maturity date of 2038 the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay shortterm debt incurred to fund capital expenditures and general working capital purposes

our board of directors has adopted a dividend policy to distribute to our stockholders a portion of our net cash provided by operating activities as regular quarterly dividends rather than retaining that cash for other purposes our policy is to distribute 50 to 70 of our net income annually we expect that dividends will be paid every march june september and december of each fiscal year to holders of record approximately 15 days prior to the distribution date since the dividends on our common stock will not be cumulative only declared dividends will be paid for 2008 we paid a dividend of 020 per share on september 2 2008 and december 1 2008 there were no dividend payments made for 2007 subject to applicable law and the discretion of our board of directors we will pay cash dividends of approximately 020 per share per quarter in 2009 to be paid approximately 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter the quarterly and annual average aggregate dividend amounts for the four quarters would be 343 million and 1371 million annually the aggregate dividend amounts are based upon the estimated average 1713 million shares outstanding during the next four quarters under delaware law our board of directors may declare dividends only to the extent of our “surplus” which is defined as total assets at fair market value minus total liabilities minus statutory capital or if there is no surplus out of our net profits for the then current andor immediately preceding fiscal year although we believe we will have sufficient net profits or surplus to pay dividends at the anticipated levels during the next four quarters our board of directors will seek periodically to assure itself of this before actually declaring any dividends in future periods our board of directors may seek opinions from outside valuation firms to the effect that our solvency or assets are sufficient to allow payment of dividends and such opinions may not be forthcoming if we sought and were not able to obtain such an opinion we likely would not be able to pay dividends 

on february 6 2009 our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of 020 per share payable on march 2 2009 to all shareholders of record as of february 18 2009

credit facilities and shortterm debt 

the components of shortterm debt were as follows 

 

 awcc has entered into a 100 million committed revolving line of credit with pnc bank na this line of credit will terminate on december 31 2009 unless extended and is used primarily for shortterm working capital needs interest rates on advances under this line of credit are based on either the prime rate of pnc bank na or the applicable libor for the term selected plus 200 basis points in addition there is a fee of 25 basis points charged quarterly on the portion of the commitment that is undrawn as of february 23 2009 december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 there was 08 million 00 million and  90 million respectively outstanding under this revolving line of credit if this line of credit were not extended beyond its current maturity date of december 31 2009 awcc would continue to have access to its 8400 million unsecured revolving credit facility described below 

  

awcc our finance subsidiary has entered into an 840 million senior unsecured credit facility syndicated among the following group of 11 banks with jpmorgan chase bank na acting as administrative agent 

 

 this revolving credit facility which was originally scheduled to terminate on september 15 2011 is principally used to support the commercial paper program at awcc and to provide up to 1500 million in letters of credit on september 14 2007 this revolving credit facility was extended for an additional year by the facility bank group making the new termination date september 15 2012 on september 15 2008 a majority of the banks agreed to further extend 6850 million of commitments under this revolving credit facility to september 15 2013 on december 18 2008 the bank of new york mellon joined the credit facility syndicate with a commitment amount of 400 million through september 15 2012 if any lender defaults in its obligation to fund advances the company may request the other lenders to assume the defaulting lender’s commitment or replace such defaulting lender by designating an assignee willing to assume the commitment however the remaining lenders have no obligation to assume a defaulting lender’s commitment and we can provide no assurances that we will replace a defaulting lender awcc had 3450 million of outstanding borrowings and 439 million of outstanding letters of credit under this credit facility as of february 23 2009 as of february 23 2009 awcc had 1785 million of commercial paper outstanding 

on december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 awcc had the following sublimits and available capacity under the revolving credit facility and indicated amounts of outstanding commercial paper 

 

 interest rates on advances under the revolving credit facility are based on either prime or libor plus an applicable margin based upon our credit ratings as well as total outstanding amounts under the agreement at the time of the borrowing the maximum libor margin is 55 basis points 

the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 on december 31 2008 our ratio was 056 and therefore we were in compliance with the ratio 

the weighted average interest rate on shortterm borrowings for the year ended december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 was approximately 351 and 549 respectively 

  

on december 17 2008 we filed a registration statement on form s1 with the securities and exchange commission relating to a proposed followon public offering of our common stock the proposed offering would include 300 million secondary offering by the selling stockholder a subsidiary of rwe ag with the proceeds going to rwe and concurrently a 300 million primary offering by us will occur with proceeds used to redeem shortterm debt there are no assurances that this transaction will occur in 2009 if we are unable to complete this transaction in 2009 or secure additional longterm financing we could reach our maximum limits on our shortterm borrowing facilities 

capital structure 

our capital structure was as follows 

 

 the changes to our capital resource mix during 2008 2007 and 2006 were accomplished through the various financing activities noted above in “cash from financing activities” the capital structure at december 31 2008 more closely reflects our expected future capital structure 

as a condition to some puc approvals of the rwe divestiture we agreed to maintain a capital structure with a minimum of 45 common equity at the time of the consummation of our initial public offering on april 28 2008 as a result of the impairment charges recorded for the three months ended march 31 2008 our capital structure did not meet this minimum requirement and we received a cash equity contribution from rwe of 2450 million on may 1 2008 this cash was used to repay 2434 million of shortterm debt contributions from rwe were 10671 million for the year ended december 31 2007 rwe is not obligated to make any additional capital contributions 

debt covenants 

our debt agreements contain financial and nonfinancial covenants to the extent that we are not in compliance we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in our ability to pay dividends issue debt or access our revolving credit lines we were in compliance with our covenants as of december 31 2008 see “risk factors—risks related to our industry and business—our failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could trigger repayment obligations” longterm debt indentures contain a number of covenants that among other things limit subject to certain exceptions the company from issuing debt secured by the company’s assets certain long term notes required the company to maintain a ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of not more than 070 to 100 in addition the company has 11049 million of notes which include the right to redeem the notes in whole or in part from time to time subject to certain restrictions 

security ratings 

our access to the capital markets including the commercial paper market and their respective financing costs in those markets depend on the securities ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets we primarily access the capital markets including the commercial paper market through awcc however we do issue debt at our regulated subsidiaries primarily in the form of tax exempt securities to lower our overall cost of debt the following table shows the company’s securities ratings as of december 31 2008 

 

   

on june 19 2008 standard  poor’s ratings services which we refer to as sp downgraded the senior unsecured issuer rating of awcc to “bbb” stable outlook from “a” negative outlook in addition sp assigned a “bbb” corporate credit rating to american water and affirmed awcc’s “a2” shortterm rating on november 14 2008 sp affirmed its “bbb” corporate credit rating on awcc and american water on january 16 2009 sp assigned its “bbb” unsecured debt rating to awcc 750 million senior unsecured monthly notes due december 1 2038 

on august 28 2007 moody’s investors service which we refer to as moody’s placed both the longterm and shortterm ratings of awcc on review for possible downgrade on october 12 2007 moody’s downgraded the senior unsecured issuer rating of awcc to “baa2” from “baa1” in addition moody’s assigned a “baa2” senior unsecured issuer rating to american water and affirmed awcc’s “p2” shortterm rating the rating outlook for both american water and awcc is stable 

a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating security ratings are highly dependent upon our ability to generate cash flows from financing and operating activities in an amount sufficient to service our debt and meet our investment plans we can provide no assurances that our ability to generate cash flow is sufficient to maintain our existing ratings 

none of our borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings although such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under our credit facilities 

as part of the normal course of business we routinely enter into contracts for the purchase and sale of water energy fuels and other services these contracts either contain express provisions or otherwise permit us and our counterparties to demand adequate assurance of future performance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so in accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law if we are downgraded by a credit rating agency especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade as a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance depending on its net position with a counterparty the demand could be for the posting of collateral in the absence of expressly agreed provisions that specify the collateral that must be provided the obligation to supply the collateral requested will be a function of the facts and circumstances of the company’s situation at the time of the demand if we can reasonably claim that we are willing and financially able to perform our obligations it may be possible to successfully argue that no collateral should be posted or that only an amount equal to two or three months of future payments should be sufficient we do not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operation financial position or cash flows 

recent market conditions 

the company believes it has sufficient liquidity despite the current disruption of the capital and credit markets the company funds liquidity needs for capital investment working capital and other financial commitments through cash flows from operations public and private debt offerings commercial paper markets and credit facilities with 8500 million in aggregate total commitment from a diversified group of banks and we had 2818 million available as of february 23 2009 the company closely monitors the financial condition of the financial institutions associated with its credit facilities 

the company’s retirement trust assets are exposed to the market prices of debt and equity securities changes to the retirement trust asset value can impact the company’s pension and other benefits expense funded status and future minimum funding requirements our risk is reduced through our ability to recover pension and other benefit costs through rates in addition pension and other benefits liabilities decrease as fixed income asset values decrease fixed income yields rise since the rate at which we discount pension and other retirement trust asset future obligations is highly correlated to fixed income yields during 2008 the market value of our pension 

  

and postretirement benefit trust assets declined by 1719 million the company performed an assetliability study on its pension and postretirement benefit trust assets and changed the asset allocation from 60 equities and 40 fixed income to 70 equities and 30 fixed income this new investment allocation was implemented in december 2008 additionally a reduction in fixed income yields rate used to discount obligations at the end of 2008 caused an increase to pension and postretirement benefit liabilities the reduction of asset values combined with an increase in pension and postretirement benefit liabilities will constitute an increase to pension and postretirement benefit costs net of capitalized amounts of approximately 320 million during 2009 compared to 2008 

the company also assessed the impact of the severe liquidity crises at major financial institutions on the company’s ability to access capital markets on reasonable terms on september 15 2008 the company was unable to access shortterm liquidity through its a2p2 rated commercial paper program the company therefore utilized its credit facilities to repay maturing commercial paper and fund its shortterm liquidity needs although the company’s credit facility syndicate banks are currently meeting all of their lending obligations there can be no assurance that these banks will be able to meet their obligations in the future if the liquidity crises intensify or are protracted 

as of december 31 2008 the company had issued through its subsidiaries 1203 million of variable rate demand bonds which are periodically remarketed we can provide no assurances that the bonds will be remarketed successfully or at reasonable interest rates bonds totaling 249 million are issued by illinois american water bonds totaling 86 million are issued by arizona american water and the remaining 869 million of bonds are issued by awcc during the months of january and february 2009 awcc purchased its variable rate demand bonds because no buyer was willing to purchase the bonds at market rates although buyers periodically purchased the bonds from awcc at market rates during january and february 2009 awcc holds all 1203 million in treasury at february 23 2009 since the debt has been remarketed for periods no longer than one week and the company cannot be certain remarketing will be successful the debt is included in current portion of longterm debt at december 31 2008 

at this time the company does not believe recent market disruptions will impact its longterm ability to obtain financing the company expects to have access to liquidity in the capital markets on favorable terms before the maturity dates of its current credit facilities and the company does not expect a significant number of its lenders to default on their commitments thereunder in addition the company can delay major capital investments or pursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity if necessary the company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time 

regulatory restrictions 

the issuance by the company or awcc of longterm debt or equity securities does not require authorization of any state puc if no guarantee or pledge of the regulated subsidiaries is utilized however state puc authorization is required to issue longterm debt or equity securities at most regulated subsidiaries our regulated subsidiaries normally obtain the required approvals on a periodic basis to cover their anticipated financing needs for a period of time or in connection with a specific financing 

under applicable law our subsidiaries can pay dividends only from retained undistributed or current earnings a significant loss recorded at a subsidiary may limit the dividends that these companies can distribute to us 

insurance coverage 

we carry various property casualty and financial insurance policies with limits deductibles and exclusions consistent with industry standards however insurance coverage may not be adequate or available to cover 

  

unanticipated losses or claims we are selfinsured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained such losses could have a material adverse effect on our shortterm and longterm financial condition and the results of operations and cash flows 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we enter into obligations with third parties in the ordinary course of business these financial obligations as of december 31 2008 are set forth in the table below 

 

 note the above table reflects only financial obligations and commitments therefore performance obligations associated with our nonregulated businesses are not included in the above amounts 

 

         publicprivate partnerships 

from 1997 through 2002 wvawc entered into a series of agreements with various public entities which we refer to as the partners to establish certain joint ventures commonly referred to as “publicprivate partnerships” under the publicprivate partnerships the wvawc constructed utility plant financed by the wvawc and the partners constructed utility plant connected to the wvawc’s property financed by the 

  

partners wvawc agreed to transfer and convey some of its real and personal property to the partners in exchange for an equal principal amount of industrial development bonds “idbs” issued by the partners under a state industrial development bond and commercial development act wvawc leased back the total facilities including portions funded by both wvawc and the partners under leases for a period of 40 years 

wvawc leased back the transferred facilities under capital leases for a period of 40 years the leases have payments that approximate the payments required by the terms of the idbs in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation number 39 offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts we have presented the transaction on a net basis in the consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the transferred facilities was approximately 1610 million at december 31 2008 

nonregulated businesses performance obligations 

our nonregulated businesses contract operations group enters into agreements for the provision of services to water and wastewater facilities for the united states military municipalities and other customers these military services agreements expire between 2053 and 2059 and have remaining performance of 11850 million at december 31 2008 the operations and maintenance agreements with municipalities and other customers expire between 2009 and 2038 and have remaining performance commitments as measured by estimated remaining contract revenue of 11038 million and 11788 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively some of the company’s longterm contracts to operate and maintain a municipality’s federal government’s or other party’s water or wastewater treatment and delivery facilities include responsibility for certain major maintenance for some of the facilities in exchange for an annual fee 

included in the military services performance commitment at december 31 2008 are contracts operations group was awarded during september 2008 for operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater systems at army installations at fort hood texas and fort polk louisiana according to the agreements the awards of the contracts are estimated at approximately 3290 million and 3480 million respectively over a 50year period as measured by gross contract revenue subject to price redeterminations and customary federal contracting termination provisions federal contract price redetermination is a mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in subsequent periods to reflect changes in contract obligations and market conditions 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the application of critical accounting policies is particularly important to our financial condition and results of operations and provides a framework for management to make significant estimates assumptions and other judgments although our management believes that these estimates assumptions and other judgments are appropriate they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain accordingly changes in the estimates assumptions and other judgments applied to these accounting policies could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 

our financial condition results of operations and cash flow are impacted by the methods assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions regarding them with our audit committee in addition our management has also reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee 

regulatory accounting 

our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state pucs and the local governments of the states in which they operate as such we account for these regulated operations in accordance with sfas no 71 “accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation” which we refer to as sfas no 71 which requires us to reflect the effects of rate regulation in our financial statements use of sfas no 71 is applicable 

  

to utility operations that meet the following criteria 1 thirdparty regulation of rates 2 costbased rates and 3 a reasonable assumption that all costs will be recoverable from customers through rates as of december 31 2008 we had concluded that the operations of our regulated subsidiaries meet the criteria if it is concluded in a future period that a separable portion of the businesses no longer meets the criteria we are required to eliminate the financial statement effects of regulation for that part of the business which would include the elimination of any or all regulatory assets and liabilities that had been recorded in the consolidated financial statements failure to meet the criteria of sfas no 71 could materially impact our consolidated financial statements as a onetime extraordinary item and through impacts on continuing operations 

regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow for recovery through rates charged to customers regulatory liabilities represent revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred as of december 31 2008 we have recorded 9197 million of net regulatory assets within our consolidated financial statements also at december 31 2008 we had recorded 3073 million of regulatory liabilities within our consolidated financial statements see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the significant regulatory assets 

for each regulatory jurisdiction where we conduct business we continually assess whether the regulatory assets and liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement this assessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in applicable regulatory environments recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation and the ability to recover costs through regulated rates 

goodwill 

the company’s annual impairment reviews are performed as of november 30 of each year in conjunction with the timing of the completion of the company’s annual strategic business plan at december 31 2008 the company’s goodwill was 16995 million the company also undertakes interim reviews when the company determines that a triggering event that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value has occurred 

the company uses a twostep impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any in accordance with sfas no 142 the step 1 calculation used to identify potential impairment compares the calculated fair value for each of the company’s reporting units to their respective net carrying values book values including goodwill on the measurement date if the fair value of any reporting unit is less than such reporting unit’s carrying value then step 2 is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any for such reporting unit 

the step 2 calculation of the impairment test compares by reporting unit the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill the implied fair value of goodwill is equal to the excess of the fair value of each reporting unit above the fair value of such reporting unit’s identified assets and liabilities if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill for any reporting unit an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill for that reporting unit 

the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit and the fair value of each reporting unit’s assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 

for the november 30 2008 impairment test the estimated fair value of the regulated reporting unit for step 1 was based on a combination of the following valuation techniques 

 

  

   

the estimated fair values of the nonregulated reporting units were determined entirely on the basis of discounted cash flow models 

the first valuation technique applies average peer multiples to the regulated reporting unit’s historic and forecasted cash flows the peer multiples are calculated using the average trading prices of comparable equity securities of publiclytraded water utilities their published cash flows and forecasts of market price and cash flows for those peers 

the second valuation technique forecasts each reporting unit’s fiveyear cash flows using an estimated longterm growth rate and discounts these cash flows at their respective estimated weighted average cost of capital 

if step 2 of the impairment test is required the company determines the fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s assets and liabilities the fair values for the majority of such assets and liabilities are equal to their carrying values however the fair values of the applicable debt are highly dependent upon market conditions surrounding the measurement date for the step 2 calculations of the fair value of debt the company uses observable prices of instruments and indices that have risks similar to those instruments being valued adjusted to compensate for differences in credit profile collateral tax treatment and call features to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit’s debt 

the company has completed its november 30 2008 annual impairment review and does not believe that the company’s goodwill balance was impaired however there can be no assurances that the company will not be required to recognize an impairment of goodwill in the future due to market conditions or other factors related to the company’s performance these market events could include a decline over a period of time of the company’s stock price a decline over a period of time in valuation multiples of comparable water utilities the lack of an increase in the company’s market price consistent with its peer companies or decreases in control premiums and the overhang effect a decline in the forecasted results in our business plan such as changes in rate case results or capital investment budgets or changes in our interest rates could also result in an impairment charge recognition of impairments of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect the company’s reported results of operations and total capitalization the effect of which could be material and could make it more difficult to maintain its credit ratings secure financing on attractive terms maintain compliance with debt covenants and meet expectations of our regulators 

in making the determination we considered both qualitative and quantitative factors including the effect of the recent volatility in the equity and debt markets on the company’s market capitalization as such the company believes that the current valuation technique is more appropriate than solely relying on the current trading market value of the company’s common stock 

in reaching our conclusion we also made certain assumptions which we believe to be appropriate that support the fair value of our reporting units we considered in addition to the listed trading price of the company’s shares the effect on that price due to rwe’s majority ownership the effect of rwe’s expected disposition of its owned company shares on the market for those shares the applicability of a control premium to our shares and certain other factors we deemed appropriate as a result we concluded that the company’s fair value exceeds what we might otherwise have concluded had we relied on market price alone 

in addition given recent market conditions management determined that it was appropriate for the company to consider the average of the company’s closing market price over a thirty day period rather than using a particular date to calculate its market capitalization the company’s calculated market capitalization within its 2008 impairment test period was approximately 9400 million below the aggregate carrying value of its reporting units 

the difference between our calculated market capitalization and the aggregate fair value of our reporting units which approximates book value resulted from the estimated control premium and the estimated impact to the company’s market capitalization from the overhang created by rwe’s announced plans to divest a substantial portion of its ownership through further public offerings of stock 

  

the estimated control premium represents the incremental premium a buyer is willing to pay to acquire a controlling majority interest in the company in estimating the control premium management principally considered the current market conditions and historical premiums paid in utility acquisitions observed in the marketplace 

the estimated stock overhang represents the impact on the company’s share price that we believe results from investor concerns over market price dilution due to the anticipated increase in the number of the company’s publicly traded shares caused by the anticipated rwe sale of the company’s stock as a condition of certain state regulator approvals for rwe’s sale of the company rwe had agreed to sell 100 of its holdings of company stock by april 2010 and previously announced its intentions to reduce its interest to below 50 prior to the end of 2008 management estimated the impact of this overhang condition using reports from multiple analysts covering the company’s stock and other available market information 

the determination of our estimated fair value required the exercise of judgment and is highly sensitive to our assumptions our estimated fair values approximate the carrying value of reporting units leaving little estimated value in excess of the required threshold of the step 1 test had the fair value been less than the carrying value of the reporting units differences between the carrying value and fair value of our longterm debt which is not taken into account in step 1 but is required in step 2 would have increased any impairment charge indicated by step 1 by an estimated 300 million due to accounting guidance that must be followed to measure the implied fair value of goodwill 

for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill including discontinued operations in the amount of 7500 million 5093 million and 2278 million respectively 

as of march 31 2008 in light of the initial public offering price and trading levels in our common stock subsequent to the date of the initial public offering the company performed an interim impairment test and on may 9 2008 management concluded that the carrying value of the company’s goodwill was impaired the company believed that the initial public offering price was indicative of the value of the company at march 31 2008 and accordingly based on those factors recorded an impairment charge to the goodwill of its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 7500 million as of march 31 2008 the impairment charge was primarily attributed to the market price of the company’s common stock both the initial public offering price and the price during subsequent trading being less than the estimate of the initial public offering price used during the 2007 annual test also contributing to the impairment was a decline in the fair value of the company’s debt due to increased market interest rates as a result of the impairment charge rwe aqua holdings gmbh a whollyowned subsidiary of rwe transferred 2450 million to the company on may 13 2008 this cash was used to reduce shortterm debt rwe is not obligated to make any additional capital contributions 

during the third quarter of 2007 as a result of the company’s debt being placed on review for a possible downgrade and the proposed sale of a portion of the company in the initial public offering management determined at that time it was appropriate to update its valuation analysis before the next scheduled annual test based on this assessment the company performed an interim impairment test and recorded an impairment charge to goodwill related to its regulated reporting unit in the amount of 2433 million as of september 30 2007 the decline was primarily due to a slightly lower longterm earnings forecast caused by updated customer demand and usage expectations and expectations for timing of capital expenditures and rate recovery 

the company completed its scheduled annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined that an impairment had occurred based upon information regarding the company’s market value in connection with the initial public offering management determined that the indicative fair value of the company based on estimates of the initial public offering price range was the best evidence of the company’s market value and incorporated this indicated market value into the company’s valuation methodology which also considered other items such as peer multiples discounted cash flows and a control premium based on the results of the impairment test an impairment of 2660 million to the company’s carrying value was recognized as of december 31 2007 

  

the 2006 impairment charge of 2278 million was attributable to higher interest rates in the regulated reporting unit and a change in the potential net realizable value of a nonregulated reporting unit 

impairment of longlived assets 

longlived assets other than goodwill which is discussed above include land buildings equipment and longterm investments longlived assets other than investments and land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable such circumstances would include items such as a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used or planned to be used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset in addition changes in the expected useful life of these longlived assets may also be an impairment indicator when such events or changes occur we estimate the fair value of the asset from future cash flows expected to result from the use and if applicable the eventual disposition of the assets and compare that to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value is greater than the fair value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value the key variables that must be estimated include assumptions regarding sales volume rates operating costs labor and other benefit costs capital additions assumed discount rates and other economic factors these variables require significant management judgment and include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events a variation in the assumptions used could lead to a different conclusion regarding the realizability of an asset and thus could have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements 

the longlived assets of the regulated utility subsidiaries are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing as they are integrated statewide operations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs a regulatory asset is charged to earnings if and when future recovery in rates of that asset is no longer probable 

the fair values of longterm investments are dependent on the financial performance and solvency of the entities in which we invest as well as volatility inherent in the external markets in assessing potential impairment for these investments we consider these factors if such assets are considered impaired an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the asset’s carrying value exceeds its fair value as a result of fair value analyses we recorded pretax charge of 0 for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and 08 million for the year ended december 31 2006 

revenue recognition 

revenues of the regulated utility subsidiaries are recognized as water and wastewater services are delivered to customers and include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the date of the latest meter reading to the end of the accounting period unbilled revenues as of december 31 2008 and 2007 were 1342 million and 1343 million respectively increases in volumes delivered to the utilities’ customers and favorable rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be significant to the calculation of unbilled revenue changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the estimated unbilled revenue however since the majority of our customers are billed on a monthly basis total operating revenues would remain materially unchanged 

revenue from nonregulated operations is recognized as services are rendered revenues from certain construction projects are recognized over the contract term based on the estimated percentage of completion during the period compared to the total estimated services to be provided over the entire contract losses on contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes probable and estimable revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenue billings in excess of revenues recognized on construction contracts are recorded as other current liabilities on the 

  

balance sheet until the recognition criteria are met changes in contract performance and related estimated contract profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined 

accounting for income taxes 

the parent company and its subsidiaries participate in a consolidated federal income tax return for united states tax purposes members of the consolidated group are charged with the amount of federal income tax expense determined as if they filed separate returns 

certain income and expense items are accounted for in different time periods for financial reporting than for income tax reporting purposes the company provides deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the amounts at which they are carried in the financial statements these deferred income taxes are based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary differences are projected to reverse in addition the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities for the effect on revenues expected to be realized as the tax effects of temporary differences previously flowed through to customers reverse 

accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 

we maintain noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of our regulated utility and shared service operations the pension plans have been closed for any employees hired on or after january 1 2006 union employees hired on or after january 1 2001 and nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2006 will be provided with a 525 of base pay defined contribution plan we also maintain postretirement benefit plans for eligible retirees the retiree welfare plans are closed for union employees hired on or after january 1 2006 the plans had previously closed for nonunion employees hired on or after january 1 2002 we follow the guidance of sfas 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” and sfas 106 “employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” when accounting for these benefits in addition we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of sfas 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” effective december 31 2006 see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the accounting for the defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 

accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets the rate of future compensation increases received by the company’s employees mortality turnover and medical costs each assumption is reviewed annually the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy these differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the company recognizes the primary assumptions are 

 

  

  

  

   

in selecting a discount rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plans a yield curve was developed for a portfolio containing the majority of united statesissued aagraded noncallable or callable with makewhole provisions corporate bonds for each plan the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments the discount rate for determining pension benefit obligations was 612 and 627 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the discount rate for determining other postretirement benefit obligations was 609 and 620 at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively the discount rate for determining both the pension obligations and other postretirement benefit obligations was 590 at december 31 2006 

the asset allocation for the company’s us pension plan at december 31 2008 and 2007 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the investment policy guidelines of the pension plan require that the fixed income portfolio has an overall weighted average credit rating of aa or better by standard  poor’s and the minimum credit quality for fixed income securities must be bbb or better up to 20 of the portfolio may be invested in collateralized mortgage obligations backed by the united states government 

the company’s other postretirement benefit plans are partially funded the asset allocation for the company’s other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2008 and 2007 by asset category are as follows 

 

 the company’s investment policy and related target asset allocation is evaluated periodically through asset liability studies the studies consider projected cash flows of maturity liabilities projected asset class return risk and correlation and risk tolerance 

the pension and postretirement welfare plan trusts investments include debt and equity securities held directly and through commingled funds the trustee for the company’s defined benefit pension and post retirement welfare plans uses independent valuation firms to calculate the fair value of plan assets additionally the company independently verifies the assets values approximately 872 of the assets are valued using the quoted market price for the assets in an active market at the measurement date the remaining 128 of the assets are valued using other observable inputs 

in selecting an expected return on plan assets we considered tax implications past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans the longterm expected rate of return on plan assets which we refer to as eroa assumption used in calculating pension cost was 790 for 2008 800 for 2007 and 825 for 2006 the weighted average eroa assumption used in calculating other postretirement benefit costs was 775 for 2008 738 for 2007 and 795 for 2006 

  

in selecting a rate of compensation increase we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates our rate of compensation increase was 400 for 2008 and 425 for 2007 and 2006 

in selecting health care cost trend rates we consider past performance and forecasts of increases in health care costs our health care cost trend rate used to calculate the periodic cost was 800 in 2008 gradually declining to 5 in 2014 and thereafter 

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans the health care cost trend rate is based on historical rates and expected market conditions a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects 

 

 we will use a discount rate and eroa of 612 and 790 respectively for estimating our 2009 pension costs additionally we will use a discount rate and expected return on plan assets of 609 and 760 respectively for estimating our 2009 other postretirement benefit costs a decrease in the discount rate or the eroa would increases our pension expense our 2008 and 2007 pension and postretirement costs were 514 million and 449 million respectively based on current plan assets and expected future asset returns the company currently estimates the increase to pension and postretirement expense net of capitalized amounts in 2009 to be approximately 32 million pretax it is the company’s intent to work with pucs in the states in which it operates to minimize the impact of such increases on its results of operations the company currently expects to make pension and postretirement benefit contributions to the plan trusts of 1252 million 1325 million 1247 million 1619 million and 1232 million in 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 respectively actual amounts contributed could change significantly from these estimates 

the assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim remeasurement of the plan obligations the impact of assumption changes is reflected in the recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts as they occur or over a period of time if allowed under applicable accounting standards the assumptions are selected to represent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall economy as these assumptions change from period to period recorded pension and postretirement benefit amounts and funding requirements could also change 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in january 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb staff position “fsp” emerging issues task force “eitf” no 99201 “amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf issue no 9920” “fsp eitf 99201” this pronouncement amends eitf 9920 “recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased beneficial interests and beneficial interests that continue to be held by a transferor in securitized financial assets” eitf 9920 to achieve more consistent determination of whether an otherthantemporary impairment has occurred fsp eitf 99211 also retains and emphasizes the objective of an other thantemporary impairment assessment and the related disclosure requirements in sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and other related guidance fsp eitf 99201 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december 15 2008 and is required to be applied prospectively the adoption of fsp eitf 99201 did not have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in december 2008 the fasb issued fas no 132r1 “employers” disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets” “fsp fas 132r1” which requires additional disclosures for employers’ pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets as pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets were not included within the scope of sfas no 157 fsp fas 132r1 requires employers to disclose information about fair value measurements of plan assets similar to the disclosures required under sfas no 157 the investment policies and strategies for the major categories of plan assets and significant concentrations of risk within plan 

  

assets fsp fas 132r1 will be effective for the registrants as of december 31 2009 as fsp fas 132r1 provides only disclosure requirements the adoption of this standard will not have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

on october 10 2008 fasb issued fasb staff position no 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when a market for that asset is not active” “fsp 1573” which clarifies the application of statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157” in an inactive market and provides an example to demonstrate how the fair value of a financial asset is determined when the market for that financial asset is inactive fsp 1573 was effective upon issuance including prior periods of which financial statements had not been issued the adoption of this standard as of september 30 2008 did not have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in february 2008 the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas 1572 which allows a oneyear deferral of the adoption of sfas 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities such as intangible assets property plant and equipment and goodwill that are required to be measured at fair value on a periodic basis such as at acquisition or impairment the company elected to use this deferral option and accordingly only partially adopted sfas 157 on january 1 2008 sfas 157 will be adopted for the company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities valued on a nonrecurring basis on january 1 2009 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 157 “fair value measurements” which we refer to as sfas 157 sfas 157 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to us generally accepted accounting principles guidance requiring use of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements on january 1 2008 the company adopted the provisions of sfas 157 for financial assets and liabilities and nonfinancial assets and liabilities with recurring measurements the company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period were cash and cash equivalents restricted funds and shortterm debt these assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on the balance sheet date using quoted prices in active markets level 1 inputs as defined by sfas 157 the adoption of sfas 157 for the company’s financial assets and liabilities did not have a material effect on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows the company measured the assets of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement welfare plans pursuant to sfas 157 as of december 31 2008 the company does not believe the adoption of sfas 157 for the company’s nonfinancial assets and liabilities will have an impact on its results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in december 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb no 51” which we refer to as sfas 160 sfas 160 establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary sfas 160 will be effective for us on january 1 2009 we do not believe this standard will have an impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

in february 2007 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities—including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “ sfas 159” this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without 

  

having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions sfas 159 is effective for years beginning january 1 2008 the company has not elected to exercise the fair value irrevocable option therefore the adoption of sfas 159 did not have an impact on the company’s results of operations financial position or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” which we refer to as sfas 158 this statement requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet under sfas 158 actuarial gains and losses prior service costs or credits and transition obligations and assets that have not been recognized in net periodic benefit cost under previous accounting standards will be recognized as a regulatory asset for the portion of the underfunded liability that meets the recovery criteria prescribed in sfas 71 and as accumulated other comprehensive income net of tax effects for that portion of the underfunded liability that does not meet sfas 71 regulatory accounting criteria we adopted the recognition and disclosure requirements of the statement on december 31 2006

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” which we refer to as fin 48 an interpretation of sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 is intended to address inconsistencies among entities with the measurement and recognition in accounting for income tax deductions for financial statement purposes specifically fin 48 addresses the timing of the recognition of income tax benefits fin 48 requires the financial statement recognition of an income tax benefit when we determine that it is morelikelythannot that the tax position will be sustained fin 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we adopted it as required on january 1 2007 and it did not have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 

during 2006 the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board ratified eitf issue no 063 “how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is gross versus net presentation” which we refer to as eitf 063 the task force reached a consensus that the scope of eitf 063 includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenueproducing transaction between a seller and a customer and that the presentation of such taxes is an accounting policy that should be disclosed our accounting policy is to present these taxes on a net basis excluded from revenues

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

american water works company inc maintains disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e of the securities exchange act of 1934 “the exchange act” that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives 

the company was not required by section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “section 404” and related sec rules and regulations to perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2008 while we were not required to conduct a section 404 evaluation as of december 31 2008 we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting relating to controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements specifically effective controls did not exist to ensure the accuracy and completeness of accounting and disclosure for such contracts and agreements 

  

such deficiency could result in misstated consolidated financial statements affecting results of operations financial position cash flows and disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

as a result of this material weakness our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2008 nevertheless management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” 

due to a transition period established by the rules of the sec for newly public companies this annual report does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or attestation report of the company’s registered public accounting firm 

plan for remediation of material weakness 

we believe that we have taken the appropriate actions to remediate the material weakness described above by 1 conducting training on controls over maintenance of contracts and agreements for personnel 2 hiring additional resources and 3 designing and implementing new policies procedures and controls we believe this material weakness will remain until we have had sufficient experience with the sustainability of the controls at the levels at which they have been operating as of december 31 2008 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter ended december 31 2008 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting
