we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financials and other information and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our dedicated inhouse research analysts consider tangible investment factors such as financial information valuation and macroeconomics in tandem with intangible environmental social and corporate governance investment factors 

our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the us and uk with additional staff based in australia china hong kong japan singapore and switzerland we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new strategies investment vehicles and other products to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period in 2021 we introduced five new strategies and several new share classes of existing strategies 

we typically provide seed capital for new investment products to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets the length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment product as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the product from unrelated investors we attempt to ensure that the new investment product has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment products net asset value or its investment performance record at december 31 2021 we had seed capital investments in our products of 13 billion 

we may also close or limit new investments to new investors across t rowe price investment products in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors at present the following strategies which represent about 10 of total assets under management at december 31 2021 are generally closed to new investors 



investment advisory fees 

we provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the us mutual funds clients on a subadvised or separately managed account basis collective investment trusts and other t rowe price products including funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

nearly 62 of our investment advisory fees are earned from our us mutual funds while about 38 of our investment advisory fees are earned from our other investment portfolios ten of our 185 us mutual funds  blue chip growth capital appreciation growth stock new horizons midcap growth largecap growth health sciences international discovery retirement 2030 and dividend growth  accounted for approximately 29 of our investment advisory revenues in 2021 and approximately 22 of our assets under management at december 31 2021 our largest client account relationship apart from the us mutual funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 7 of our investment advisory revenues in 2021

us mutual funds 

at december 31 2021 assets under our management in the us mutual funds aggregated 8714 billion an increase of 97 or 768 billion from the beginning of the year investment advisory services are provided to each us mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the 

t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the us mutual funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the us mutual funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate for the majority of the us mutual funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the us mutual funds if the combined net assets of these us mutual funds exceed 845 billion the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 281 basis points for the first 845 billion of net assets plus 260 basis points for net assets in excess of 845 billion to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds have tiered individual fund rates that reduce their individual flat fee based on certain asset levels of the fund as described in their prospectus the effective fee rates for each of the stock bond and multiasset funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of 10 million or greater in 2021 varied from a low of 31 basis points for the shortterm bond fund to a high of 104 basis points for the international discovery fund 

the fee rate of several of the us mutual funds including the targetdate index funds and spectrum funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and as a result our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs 

each us mutual fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer and subtransfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses such as those described above in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured 

additionally we have contractual management fee waivers for certain us mutual funds including nearly all money market funds which could occur under certain specified circumstances unlike traditional expense limits for newly organized funds these waivers will not be recovered by t rowe price in the future in addition to these contractual fee waivers due to the low interest rate environment in 2021 we voluntarily waived 579 million or less than 1 of our investment advisory fees from certain of our money market mutual funds trusts and other investment portfolios in order to maintain a positive yield for investors the firm expects to continue to waive fees through at least the first half of 2022

subadvised funds separate accounts collective investment trusts and other investment products 

our subadvised separate accounts collective investment trusts and other investment products had assets under management of 7804 billion at december 31 2021 an increase of 1045 billion from the beginning of the year this includes 109 billion of feebasis assets under management attributable to separate accounts that were acquired as part of the oha acquisition other investment products include openended investment products offered to investors outside the us and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us we earn investment management fees from these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided and these investment management fees are computed using the value of assets under management at a contracted annual fee rate or the products effective fee rate for those with a tieredfee rate structure 

the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations end of billing period valuations or monthend average valuations in 2021 approximately 79 of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 15 were based on end of billing period valuations and 6 were based on monthend averages 

our standard subadvised client accounts normally pay a daily tiered rate and their agreement typically provides for termination with 60 days notice for separately managed accounts the fee is generally based on a period ending value and their agreements provide for termination at any time unearned fees paid in advance are refunded upon termination we currently also earn performancebased investment advisory fees on certain separately managed accounts these fees are currently immaterial to our total investment advisory fees and are only recognized when the performance condition has been met this recognition criteria can lead to uneven recognition of performancebased revenue throughout the year 

our us collective investment trusts sponsored by t rowe price trust company and subscribed to by certain qualified us retirement plans normally pay an allinclusive tiered rate investment management fee computed on a daily basis 

our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other t rowe price products that pay management fees on a daily basis normally provides for termination with 30 days notice the following table details the services provided by certain of our subsidiaries based on our nonus global investment products

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies hedge funds and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services some of these financial institutions have greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services 

in recent years we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies as a result such products have taken market share from active managers while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain we believe there will always be demand for good active management investment products 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationships

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

• investment performance if the investment performance of our managed investment portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable thirdparty benchmarks we could lose existing and potential clients and suffer a decrease in assets under management 

• general financial market declines we derive a significant portion of our revenues from advisory fees on managed investment portfolios a downturn in financial markets would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management 

• investment concentration the allocation of investment products for assets under management within market segments or strategies may impact associated fees that can vary depending on product offerings 

page 14 

    

• investor mobility our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time without advance notice and with little to no significant penalty 

• capacity constraints prolonged periods of strong relative investment performance andor strong investor inflows has resulted in and may result in capacity constraints within certain strategies which can lead to among other things the closure of those strategies to new investors 

• investing trends changes in investing trends particularly investor preference for passive or alternative investment products as well as increasing investor preference for environmentally and socially responsible investment products and changes in retirement savings trends may reduce interest in our products and may alter our mix of assets under management 

• interest rate changes investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income and multiasset investment portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates 

• geopolitical exposure our managed investment portfolios may have significant investments in markets that are subject to risk of loss from political or diplomatic developments government policies civil unrest currency fluctuations illiquidity and capital controls and changes in legislation related to ownership limitations 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition particularly in market segments where our assets are concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

a majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the us mutual funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the us mutual funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each t rowe price mutual fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each t rowe price mutual fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a t rowe price mutual fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the us mutual funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry competitive pressures may result in a loss of clients and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients thereby reducing our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions some of these financial institutions have greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some competitors operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them substantially all of our investment products are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing products 

the market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive investment products as a result investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us while we believe there will always be demand for strong performing active management we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain 

as part of our continued efforts to attract and retain clients we develop and launch new products and services which may require expenditure of resources and may expose us to new regulatory or compliance requirements as well as increased risk of operational or client service errors 

in the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures which we have done selectively in the past revenues and operating margins could be 

page 15 

    

adversely impacted fee reductions may vary depending on strategy and product offerings which could result in investment rebalancing or reallocation adversely impacting revenues and operating margins 

our operations are complex and a failure to properly execute operational processes could have an adverse effect on our reputation and decrease our revenues 

we provide global investment management and administrative services to our clients in certain cases we rely on thirdparty service providers for the execution and delivery of these services there can be no assurance that these vendors will properly perform these processes or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties failure to properly execute or oversee these services could have an adverse impact on our business financial results and reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties or litigation 

new investment strategies investment vehicles distribution channels or other evolutions of or additions to our business may increase the risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to control the risks introduced by such changes significant business changes may require us to update our processes or technology and may increase risk to meeting our business objectives in addition our information systems and technology platforms might not be able to accommodate our continued growth and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level if any of these factors were to arise it could disrupt our operations increase our expenses or result in financial exposure regulatory inquiry or reputational damage 

our business model is dependent on our personnel as well as others involved in our business such as thirdparty vendors providers and other intermediaries who support internal controls supervision technology and training to provide comfort that our activities do not violate applicable guidelines rules and regulations or adversely affect our clients counterparties or us and all of which are subject to potential human errors our personnel and others involved in our business may make errors that are not always immediately detected which may disrupt our operations cause losses lead to regulatory fines or sanctions litigation or otherwise damage our reputation 

the quantitative models we use may contain errors which could result in financial losses or adversely impact product performance and client relationships 

we use various quantitative models to support investment decisions and investment processes including those related to portfolio management and portfolio risk analysis as well as those related to client investment or savings advice or guidance any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on our business and reputation 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income or access to capital 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client service our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed actual or perceived failure to adequately address the environmental social and governance esg expectations of our various stakeholders could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of client assets or harm our access to capital furthermore esg issues have been the subject of increased focus by regulators and any inability to meet applicable requirements or expectations may adversely impact our reputation misconduct by our employees or thirdparty service providers could likewise adversely impact our reputation and lead to a loss of client assets while we maintain policies procedures and controls to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized activities we are subject to the risk that our associates or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures real or perceived conflicts between our clients’ interests and our own as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information may impair our reputation and subject us to litigation or regulatory action any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

page 16 

    

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

• expenses incurred in connection with our multiyear strategic plan to strengthen our longterm competitive position 

• variations in the level of total compensation expense due to changes in among other things bonuses stockbased awards employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes our employee count and mix competitive factors market performance and inflation 

• changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the us and further penetrating us distribution channels 

• expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development 

• changes in the costs incurred for thirdparty vendors that perform certain administrative and operating services 

• changes in expenses that are correlated to our assets under management such as distribution and servicing fees 

• a future impairment of investments that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 

• a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 

• unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad 

• unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill 

• future changes to legal and regulatory requirements and potential litigation and 

• disruptions of thirdparty services such as communications power and mutual fund transfer agent investment management trading and accounting systems 

under our agreements with the us mutual funds we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any t rowe price investment products any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

our hedging strategies utilized to mitigate risk may not be effective which could impact our earnings 

we employ hedging strategies related to our supplemental savings plan in order to hedge the liability related thereto in the event that our hedging strategies are not effective the resulting impact may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

amendments to tax laws may impact the marketability of the products and services we offer our clients or the financial position of the company 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we cannot predict future changes in the tax regulations to which we are subject and these regulations could have a material impact on our tax liability or result in increased costs of our tax compliance efforts 

additionally changes in the status of tax deferred investment options including retirement plans taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment products less favorably and reduce investor demand for products and services we offer which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues 

page 17 

    

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

based on the global nature of our business from time to time we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we have a process to evaluate whether to record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our estimates 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment products and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment products and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our products it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of an investment adviser and investment products these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment product as better meeting their particular clients needs we cannot assure that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries as a result of these changes more of our revenues may be concentrated with fewer intermediaries which may impact our dependence on these intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflicts trade wars tariffs or sanctions terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures epidemics or pandemics climate change increased severity of weather events or natural disasters and other events outside of our control could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

• decreasing investment valuations in and returns on the investment portfolios that we manage 

• causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive 

• incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our employees 

• interrupting our business operations or those of critical service providers 

• triggering technology delays or failures and 

• requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage replace our facilities and restore our operations 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region colorado springs colorado and in london england in addition we maintain offices with associates in many other global locations including sydney australia hong kong singapore tokyo japan and luxembourg we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur we also rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to financial losses a tarnished reputation and loss of clients that could result in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

page 18 

    

our business financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected by the coronavirus or other global pandemics 

since early 2020 global financial markets have been monitoring and reacting to the novel coronavirus pandemic the spread of the coronavirus has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption to the global economy and may further impact our business financial condition and results of operations the coronavirus pandemic has adversely affected global financial markets and impacted global supply chains health concerns and uncertainty regarding continued coronavirus impacts could lead to further andor increased volatility in global capital and credit markets adversely affect our key executives and other personnel clients investors providers suppliers lessees and other third parties and negatively impact our assets under management aum revenues income business and operations since our revenue is based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management the ultimate impact on global financial markets and our clients’ decisions related to this event could adversely affect our revenue and operating results 

furthermore while we have in place robust and wellestablished business continuity plans that address the potential impact to our associates and our facilities and a comprehensive suite of technologies which enable our associates to work remotely and conduct business and to date while we have been successful in navigating these challenges no assurance can be given that the steps we have taken will continue to be effective or appropriate additionally we must effectively ensure a safe working environment for associates working onsite in our offices and adequately manage the postpandemic transition from remote to onsite or a hybrid working environment in the event that our associates become incapacitated by the coronavirus our business operations may be impacted which could lead to reputational and financial harm 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

separately from the investments we manage for our clients we currently have a substantial investment portfolio all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant impairments or unrealized losses on these investments in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue strategic transactions in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position and these could pose risks 

from time to time we consider strategic opportunities including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations organizational restructurings joint ventures or similar transactions any of which may impact our business we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify consummate and successfully complete such transactions and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction these initiatives typically involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges to our ongoing business operations in addition acquisitions and related transactions involve risks including unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping additional or new regulatory requirements operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects on our earnings in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 23 investment in uti asset management company ltd uti an indian asset management company and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

on december 29 2021 we completed our acquisition of oha important ongoing integrationrelated risks including that the anticipated benefits of the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected or that the integration may cost more or take longer than expected could adversely impact our operating results the ongoing integration of oha is a timeconsuming process that could distract our management and disrupt our business a significant portion of ohas revenue is derived from performance fees on investment advisory agreements and carried interest from general partner interests in affiliated private investment funds generally oha is entitled to a performance fee and carried interest under these agreements only in cases where the related 

page 19 

    

portfolio investment return exceeds agreedupon relative or absolute investment return thresholds and there can be no assurance that these thresholds will be met 

we are exposed to risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

• difficulty in managing operating and marketing our international operations 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under our management revenues expenses and assets in our us dollar based financial statements and 

• significant adverse changes in international legal and regulatory environments 

human capital risks 

our success depends on our key personnel and our investment performance and financial results could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees generally our associates can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to attract or retain key personnel 

due to the global nature of our investment advisory business our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions we have near and longterm succession planning processes including programs to develop our future leaders which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent however in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income and potentially result in complex litigation 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations new regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and 

page 20 

    

profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

• as part of the debate in washington dc and in state legislatures there has been increasing focus on the framework of the us retirement system we could experience adverse business impacts if legislative and regulatory changes limit retirement plans to certain products and services or favor certain investment vehicles that we do not offer materially limit retirement savings opportunities or foster substantial outflows from retirement savings plans for nonretirement purposes 

• there has been substantial regulatory and legislative activity at federal and state levels regarding standards of care for financial services firms related to both retirement and taxable accounts and the united states department of labor intends to propose new fiduciary rules applicable to retirement plans and accounts that comprise a majority of our accounts actions taken by applicable regulatory or legislative bodies may impact our business activities and increase our costs 

• the federal reserve board has adopted final regulations related to nonbank systemically important financial institutions sifis and other jurisdictions are contemplating similar regulation at this time us regulators have not designated mutual funds or traditional asset managers as nonbank sifis however if any t rowe price fund or t rowe price affiliate was deemed a sifi increased regulatory oversight would apply to our business which may include enhanced capital liquidity leverage stress testing resolution planning and risk management requirements 

• the commodity futures trading commission cftc regulation may limit the ability of certain t rowe price investment products to use futures swaps and other derivatives we have registered certain subsidiaries with the cftc subjecting us to additional regulatory requirements and costs but also providing us additional flexibility to utilize such products nonetheless there are still certain limitations on our investment products due to cftc rules 

• there has been increased global regulatory focus on the manner in which intermediaries are paid for distribution of mutual funds changes to longstanding market practices related to fees or enhanced disclosure requirements may negatively impact sales of mutual funds by intermediaries especially if such requirements are not applied to other investment products 

• we remain subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection of data we maintain concerning our clients and employees these requirements continue to evolve most commonly in ways that increase the complexity and costs of compliance for example california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the ccpa effective in january 1 2020 which among other things significantly increased compliance obligations and the potential penalties for noncompliance and california voters in november 2020 approved a replacement of this law effective january 1 2023 with a new law that expands various requirements 

• after the 2008 financial crisis global regulations on overthecounter derivatives spearheaded by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the united states and european market infrastructure regulation in the european union eu have imposed clearing margin trade reporting electronic trading and recordkeeping requirements on market participants alongside their general stabilizing and riskreducing effect on the markets these requirements have introduced operational complexity and additional costs to derivatives portfolios 

• the revised markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii directive and regulation mifir together “mifid ii” applied across the eu and member states of the european economic area beginning on january 3 2018 implementation of mifid ii has significantly impacted both the structure and operation of eu financial markets some of the main changes introduced under mifid ii include applying enhanced disclosure requirements enhancing conduct of business and governance requirements broadening the scope of pre and post trade transparency increasing transaction reporting requirements transforming the relationship between client commissions and research and further regulation of trading venues compliance with mifid ii has increased operational complexity and increased our costs for example we began to pay for thirdparty 

page 21 

    

investment research used by our ukbased investment manager t rowe price international ltd in 2018 and we now pay for all the research needs of our investment professionals globally 

• new laws or regulations involving esg integration and disclosure may materially impact the asset management industry for example the eu’s recent action plan on financing sustainable growth includes initiatives to integrate esg into the financial system furthermore the sec and other regulators in the us have announced plans to pursue similar initiatives including additional disclosure obligations that would apply to our business operations our employee and board diversity and other esgrelated matters 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties and costs from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including client claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

united kingdom exit from european union 

we have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the united kingdom “uk” to support our global investment management business we have realigned our european union eu and uk operations in response to the uk exit “brexit” from the eu however we cannot predict the ultimate impact of brexit on our operations or our business we remain committed to our clients associates and business expansion across the region 

technology risks 

we require significant quantities and types of technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on significant quantities of technology and in many cases highly specialized or proprietary or thirdparty licensed technology to support our business functions including among others 

• securities analysis 

• securities trading 

• portfolio management 

page 22 

    

• client service 

• accounting and internal financial reporting processes and controls 

• data security and integrity and 

• regulatory compliance and reporting 

all of our technology systems including those provided by vendors are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage coding errors and other causes a suspension or termination of vendorprovided software licenses or related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems including those provided by vendors were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of clients and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown or disruption in services from a vendor could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and liability to our clients 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many systems andor countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose clients and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses 

we are dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities we maintain to protect our systems and data an externally caused information security incident such as a cyberattack a phishing scam virus ransomware attack denialofservice attack or an attack launched from within the company could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of confidential client or competitive information in addition our thirdparty vendors and other intermediaries with which we conduct business and transmit data could be subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event and we cannot ensure that such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of information in the custody of those third parties or to allow them to continue their business operations including their services to us in a timely manner 

there have been increasing numbers of publicized cybersecurity incidents in recent years impacting other financial services firms as well as firms in other industries our use of thirdparty vendors and cloud technologies could heighten this risk should the technology operations on which we rely be compromised we may have to make significant investments to upgrade repair or replace our technology infrastructure or thirdparty vendors and may not be able to make such investments on a timely basis although we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable prudent and adequate for the purpose of our business it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from breaches of security cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity or any resulting disruptions from such events 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard and maintain confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients associates and other parties as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that both inadvertent errors and fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or detected in a timely manner we also leverage cloudbased solutions for the transmission and storage of this information our systems or those of thirdparty service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code additionally authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release or alter confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things 

• seriously damage our reputation 

• allow competitors access to our proprietary business information 

page 23 

    

• subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard data of clients associates and other parties 

• result in the termination of contracts by our existing clients 

• subject us to regulatory action and potential litigation and 

• require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 

furthermore if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally overrides or circumvents our established controls with respect to confidential data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal and state laws and foreign laws and regulations governing the protection of personal or confidential data such as the eu’s general data protection regulation g overnmental authorities throughout the us and around the world have enacted or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection additionally the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection use dissemination and security of data each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business or restrict our use or storage of personal information which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our 2021 revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in us mutual funds subadvised funds separately managed accounts collective investment trusts and other t rowe price products the other t rowe price products include openended investment products offered to investors outside the us and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us we also provide certain investment advisory clients with related administrative services including distribution mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans brokerage trust services and nondiscretionary advisory services through model delivery 

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and collective investment trusts and other investment products which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations additionally approximately 30 of our operating expenses for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 are impacted by changes in assets under management 

we incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management 

the general trend to passive investing has been persistent and accelerated in recent years which has negatively impacted our new client inflows however over the long term we expect wellexecuted active management to play an important role for investors in this regard we have ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities we are investing in key capabilities including investment professionals distribution professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly we provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service 

on december 29 2021 we completed our acquisition of oak hill advisors lp a leading alternative credit manager and other entities that had common ownership collectively oha we acquired 100 of the equity interests of oak hill advisors lp 100 of the equity interests in entities that make coinvestments in certain affiliated private investment funds the coinvestment entities and a majority of the equity interests in entities that have interests in general partners of affiliated private investment funds and are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of income the carried interest entities the acquisition of oha included 57 billion of capital under management of which 47 billion of feebasis assets under management was added to our assets under management as of the date of the acquisition the acquisition accelerates our expansion into alternatives

market trends 

even though the coronavirus pandemic continued major us stock indexes climbed in 2021 extending the brisk rebound that started in latemarch 2020 equities advanced as the economy reopened and recovered—facilitated by the rollout of coronavirus vaccines and some federal fiscal relief—and as corporations reported robust earnings growth elevated inflation stemming in part from shortages of some goods and materials amid global supply chain disruptions the emergence of variants of the coronavirus and the federal reserve’s decision to taper its monthly asset purchases starting in november were among the factors that have weighed on the financial markets 

stocks in developed nonus equity markets rose but lagged us shares european stock markets were broadly positive in us dollar terms several markets produced gains exceeding 20 shares in spain and portugal trailed with gains of less than 2 developed asian markets were mixed in dollar terms hong kong stocks fell about 4 due in part to the chinese government’s regulatory crackdown in certain sectors as well as concerns about some highly indebted firms in the chinese property market japanese shares gained about 2 

stocks in emerging markets generally declined in us dollar terms as currency weakness versus the dollar reduced local returns to us investors in asia stocks in taiwan and india surged almost 27 but chinese shares fell nearly 22 amid the government’s regulatory crackdown and concerns about the property market latin american markets were also mixed as several countries struggled with political uncertainty currency weakness and elevated inflation that prompted central banks to raise shortterm interest rates stocks in most emerging european markets appreciated but turkish shares and the lira plunged as the central bank reduced shortterm interest rates in the final months of the year despite elevated inflation 

returns of several major equity market indexes for 2021 are as follows 



1 returns exclude dividends 

global bond returns were mostly negative amid rising bond market interest rates and as the year progressed growing expectations for major central banks to curtail their stimulus efforts in the us yields rose across the treasury yield curve—especially in the intermediateterm portion of the curve—amid expectations that the federal reserve’s tapering of monthly asset purchases which began in november will be a prelude to tighter monetary policy sometime in 2022 the 10year us treasury note yield increased from 093 to 152 in 2021 

in the us taxable investmentgrade universe treasury securities performed worst while corporate mortgagebacked and commercial mortgagebacked securities fell to a lesser extent assetbacked securities held up best albeit with slight losses taxfree municipal securities produced positive returns as municipal yields rose less than comparable treasury yields high yield bonds strongly outperformed for the year 

bonds in developed nonus markets declined in us dollar terms as a stronger us dollar versus the yen the euro and other currencies reduced local returns to us investors emerging markets bonds also declined as bond yields increased and many emerging countries raised shortterm interest rates in an attempt to stem inflation local currency issues fared worse than dollardenominated debt as most emerging markets currencies declined against the dollar

assets under management 

assets under management ended 2021 at 16878 billion an increase of 2173 billion from the end of 2020 this increase was primarily driven by market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested of 1989 billion the acquisition of oha completed on december 29 2021 included 57 billion of capital under management which includes net assets value portfolio value andor unfunded capital of which 469 million of feebasis assets under management are included in the assets under management in the tables below these increases were partially offset by net cash outflows of 285 billion for 2021 clients transferred 238 billion in net assets from the us mutual funds primarily to collective investment trusts of which 162 billion transferred into the retirement date trusts

investment advisory clients outside the us account for 99 of our assets under management at december 31 2021 and 93 at december 31 2020 the percentage at december 31 2021 reflects the assets under management from ohas clients outside the united states 

our net cash flows in 2021 reflect net outflows from domestic equity as well as domestic fixed income these outflows also reflect the redemption of about 25 billion from our us mutual fund investments to fund the cash portion of the oha acquisition these outflows were partially offset by cash inflows in our multiasset franchise and international fixed income from a geography perspective the americas and emea regions experienced net outflows predominantly in equity in both regions while apac had positive net flows net cash flows for 2020 reflect positive flows into fixed income and international equity while experiencing net outflows in domestic equity and our multiasset franchise resulting from macroeconomic headwinds and ongoing pressure from passive investments net cash flows for 2019 were driven by diversified inflows across distribution channels and geographies the strength of our multiasset franchise and positive flows into fixed income and international equity

results of operations 

the following table and discussion set forth information regarding our consolidated financial results for 2021 2020 and 2019 on a us gaap basis and a nongaap basis the nongaap basis adjusts for the impact of our consolidated t rowe price investment products the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability and related economic hedges investment income related to certain other investments and certain nonrecurring charges and gains including in 2021 transaction costs associated with the acquisition of oha 

we completed our acquisition of oha on december 29 2021 however our results of operations do not include any financial results of oha for 2021 as the oha activity between the closing date and december 31 2021 was deemed to be immaterial we currently expect acquisitionrelated intangibles amortization fair value adjustments of contingent consideration acquisitionrelated retention compensation expense and other acquisitionrelated expenses to impact our operating results beginning in 2022

2 see the reconciliation to the comparable us gaap measures at the end of the results of operations section of this managements discussion and analysis 

3 average assets under management for 2021 does not include the impact of the acquired feebasis assets under management related to the oha acquisition 

results overview  2021 as compared to 2020 

investment advisory revenues investment advisory fees are earned based on the value and composition of our assets under management which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows as our average assets under management increase or decrease in a given period the level of our investment advisory fee revenue for that same period generally fluctuates in a similar manner our annualized effective fee rates can be impacted by market or cash flow related shifts among asset and share classes price changes in existing products and asset level changes in products with tieredfee structures 

investment advisory revenues earned in 2021 increased 247 over the comparable 2020 period as average assets under our management increased 3514 billion or 282 to 15993 billion in 2021 we voluntarily waived 579 million or less than 1 of our investment advisory fees from certain of our money market mutual funds trusts and other investment portfolios in order to maintain a positive yield for investors at december 31 2021 combined net assets of the investment portfolios in which we waived fees in 2021 were 220 billion we anticipate that the waivers in q1 2022 will be at a slightly lower level than q4 2021 and we expect to continue to waive fees through at least the first half of 2022 

the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 444 basis points in 2021 compared with 456 basis points earned in 2020 our effective fee rate has declined largely due to the july 2021 fee reductions in our target date products client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes over 

page 33 

    

the last year higher money market fee waivers and lower performancebased fees these were partially offset as higher market valuations led to an asset class shift towards equity strategies 

operating expenses operating expenses were 39619 million in 2021 an increase of 145 over the comparable 2020 period on a nongaap basis operating expenses were 38403 million a 149 increase over the comparable 2020 period 

the increase in both gaap and nongaap operating expenses was primarily due to higher compensation expenses including higher annual bonuses salaries and benefits and stockbased compensation expenses as a result of continued investment in hiring for our business as well as higher distribution and servicing costs due to higher average assets under management the 2021 period also reflects costs incurred from an expanded relationship with fis capital markets us llc fis which began providing technology development and core operations for our fullservice recordkeeping offering in august 2021 these costs incurred from the fis arrangement were partially offset by a reduction in compensation expenses as a result of the approximately 800 associates who transitioned to fis in august 2021 

the firm currently estimates its 2022 nongaap operating expenses including a fullyear of ohas operating expenses will grow in the range of 12 to 16 without consideration of ohas operating expenses the firms 2022 nongaap operating expenses are expected to grow in the range of 4 to 8 the firm could elect to adjust its expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise including significant market movements 

operating margin our operating margin in 2021 was 484 compared with 442 in 2020 the increase in our operating margin in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by revenue growth outpacing the increase in operating expenses 

diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share was 1312 in 2021 as compared to 998 in 2020 on a nongaap basis diluted earnings per share was 1275 in 2021 as compared to 958 for 2020 the increase in both gaap and nongaap diluted earnings per share in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by higher operating income lower weighted average outstanding shares and a lower effective tax rate these drivers of the increase were partially offset by lower net investment gains recognized in 2021 than in 2020 see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

future operating results impact of oha acquisition 

as part of the oha acquisition certain assets and liabilities resulting from the purchase price allocation along with certain retentionrelated arrangements will impact our operating results in future periods these include the amortization of certain intangibles fair value adjustments of contingent consideration amortization of any fair market value basis differences and compensation expense of retentionrelated arrangements the table below highlights the maximum future impact of these items on our consolidated income statement and expected future recognition period see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more information about these acquisitionrelated items 

page 34 

    



1 related operating results impact is anticipated to be a nongaap adjustment beginning in 2022 

results overview  2020 as compared to 2019 

investment advisory revenues in 2020 investment advisory revenues increased 114 over the comparable 2019 period as average assets under our management increased 1386 billion or 125 to 12479 billion 

the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 456 basis points in 2020 compared with 461 basis points earned in 2019 our effective fee rate declined largely due to client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes and the money market fee waivers these declines were partially offset by performancebased fees earned in 2020 

operating expenses for 2020 operating expenses were 34610 million as compared with 32309 million in the 2019 period the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a 386 million increase in expense related to the supplemental savings plan from higher market returns higher compensation expenses and our continued strategic investments 

in 2020 our nongaap operating expenses increased 61 to 33427 million compared with 2019 see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

operating margin our operating margin in 2020 was 442 compared with 425 in 2019 the increase in our operating margin in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the higher net revenues partially offset by higher compensationrelated expenses 

diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share was 998 in 2020 as compared with 870 in 2019 the 147 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2020 compared to 2019 as primarily driven by higher operating income lower weighted average outstanding shares and a lower effective tax rate these drivers of the increase were partially offset by lower net investment gains recognized in 2020 than in 2019 

page 35 

    

on a nongaap basis diluted earnings per share were 958 in 2020 as compared with 807 in 2019 the increase in nongaap diluted earnings per share was primarily due to higher operating income lower weighted average outstanding shares and a lower effective tax rate the impact of these drivers were partially offset by lower net investment gains recognized in 2020 than in 2019 see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

net revenues 



investment advisory fees the relationship between the change in average assets under management and the change in investment advisory fee revenue for 2021 2020 and 2019 are presented below 



in general strong market returns in 2021 shifted the asset and share class mix among different fee rates and products including those with tieredfee structures additionally we have reduced the management fees of certain products over the last few years including fee reductions in our target date products in july 2021 

in 2021 the relationship between us mutual funds average assets under management and investment advisory fee growth was impacted by the july 2021 fee reductions in our target date products and increased money market fees waivers 

for the subadvised funds separate accounts collective investment trusts and other investment products the july 2021 target date products fee reductions and lower performance fees reduced our effective fee rate but was partially offset by a mix shift towards equities and inflows into our international products these investment advisory revenues include fees earned for distributionrelated services that we contract thirdparty intermediaries to provide the costs we incur to pay the thirdparty intermediaries are recorded as part of distribution and servicing expenses 

in 2020 in general strong market returns shifted the asset and share class mix among different fee rates and products including those with tieredfee structures additionally we have reduced the management fees of certain products over the last few years the relationship between average assets under management and investment 

page 36 

    

advisory fee growth was also impacted by the money market fees waivers and client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes 

administrative distribution and servicing fees administrative distribution and servicing fees in 2021 were 5738 million an increase of 602 million from 2020 the higher fees were primarily due to increased transfer agent servicing activities provided to our us mutual funds higher model delivery revenue as well as higher 12b1 revenue earned on the advisor and r share classes of the us mutual funds as a result of increased assets under management in these share classes the increase in 12b1 revenue is offset entirely by costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries that source these assets and is reported in distribution and servicing expense 

for 2020 administrative distribution and servicing fees were 5136 million an increase of 82 million from 2019 the higher fees were primarily due to increased transfer agent servicing activities provided to our us mutual funds this increase was partially offset by lower 12b1 revenue earned on the advisor and r classes of the us mutual funds as well as client transfers to lower fee vehicles and share classes have reduced assets under management in these share classes 

net revenues are presented after the elimination of 55 million for 2021 99 million for 2020 and 68 million for 2019 earned from our consolidated t rowe price investment products the corresponding expenses recognized by these consolidated products were also eliminated from operating expenses 

operating expenses 



compensation and related costs excluding supplemental savings plan compensation and related costs excluding the supplemental savings plan increased 2294 million or 111 for 2021 as compared with 2020 this increase was primarily due to our strong operating results which led to an 1076 million increase in our annual bonus compensation and 284 million in higher stockbased compensation expense also contributing to the increase in costs was a 885 million increase in salaries benefits and related employee costs due to modest increases in base salaries at the beginning of the year as well as an increase in our average headcount excluding the transition of 800 t rowe price operations and technology associates to fis on august 1 2021 and the addition of oha associate at the end of the year these increases in compensation and related costs were offset in part by 117 million in higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software in 2021 

for 2020 compensation and related costs excluding the supplemental savings plan increased 1746 million or 92 as compared with 2019 this increase was primarily due to an 830 million increase in salaries benefits and related employee costs as our average staff size increased 58 from prior year and we made modest increases to base salaries at the beginning of the year strong 2020 operating results led to a 655 million increase in our annual variable compensation primarily bonus compensation and higher stockbased compensation expense these increases in compensation and related costs were partially offset by 304 million in higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software in 2020 

page 37 

    

distribution and servicing costs distribution and servicing costs were 3739 million for 2021 an increase of 954 million or 343 compared to 2020 the increase was primarily driven by higher aumbased distribution costs as a result of continued market appreciation and inflows into our international products including our japanese itms and sicavs higher costs incurred to distribute certain other products through us financial intermediaries also contributed to the increase 

distribution and servicing costs were 2785 million for 2020 an increase of 160 million or 61 compared with 2019 the increase was primarily driven by higher distribution costs as a result of continued inflows into our international products including our japanese itms and sicavs these higher distribution costs were partially offset by client transfers largely from advisor and r classes to vehicles that dont pay distribution and servicing costs 

distribution and servicing costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries that source the assets of certain share classes of our us mutual funds and our international products such as our japanese itms and sicavs are recognized in this expense both of these costs are offset entirely by the revenue we earn and report in net revenues 12b1 revenue recognized in administrative distribution and servicing fees for the us mutual funds and investment advisory fee revenue for our international products 

advertising and promotion advertising and promotion costs were 1002 million for 2021 an increase of 165 million or 197 compared with 2020 the increase was primarily driven by increased media spend during 2021 

for 2020 advertising and promotion costs were 837 million a decrease of 131 million or 135 compared with 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by lower media costs and fewer conference and promotional events in 2020 as a result of cancellations arising from the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 

product and recordkeeping related costs product and recordkeeping related costs were 2363 million for 2021 an increase of 808 million or 520 compared with 2020 more than 85 of the increase in 2021 was driven by the recordkeeping costs incurred as part of our expanded fis relationship including certain transition expenses that will not recur in 2022 while these transition expenses will not recur we do expect to incur certain technologyrelated costs as part of this expanded relationship with fis over the next few years these will be reported as technology occupancy and facility costs 

product and recordkeeping related costs were 1555 million for 2020 an increase of 23 million or 15 compared with 2019 the increase is primarily due to higher expenses related to servicing retirement plan products partially offset by lower costs incurred to provide administrative services to the us mutual funds 

technology occupancy and facility costs technology occupancy and facility costs were 4849 million for 2021 4448 million for 2020 and 4273 million for 2019 the increases over the last two years were due primarily to ongoing investment in our technology capabilities including hosting solution licenses and related depreciation the 2019 year included certain nonrecurring office facility costs 

general administrative and other costs general administrative and other costs were 3836 million for 2021 3161 million for 2020 and 3219 million for 2019 nearly 50 of the increase in 2021 was related to the transaction costs incurred to complete the acquisition of oha higher information services legal and thirdparty research costs contributed to the remaining increase in 2021 compared with 2020 travelrelated expenses in 2021 were lower than 2020 and both 2021 and 2020 expenses were lower than travelrelated expenses in 2019 due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic 

for 2020 higher thirdparty investment research costs professional fees and other administrative related costs in 2020 were more than offset by lower travelrelated expenses

nonoperating income 

net nonoperating investment income decreased 2119 million in 2021 compared with 2020 and decreased 438 million in 2020 compared with 2019 net nonoperating investment activity for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 comprised the following 



our investment portfolio for 2021 generated lower market gains than our investment portfolio in 2020 our consolidated investment products and supplemental savings plan hedge portfolio comprised approximately 55 of the net gains recognized in 2021 our cash and discretionary investments generated income of 287 million in 2021 as compared to 927 million in 2020 

during the first quarter of 2020 the coronavirus pandemic caused global economies and market disruptions but strong markets for the remainder of 2020 reversed net investment losses experienced in the first quarter and generated significant gains by the end of 2020 our consolidated investment products and supplemental savings plan hedge portfolio comprised almost 70 of the net gains recognized in 2020 our cash and discretionary investments generated income of 927 million in 2020 as compared to 1260 million in 2019 as the very low interest environment reduced the dividends earned from our money market fund investments

our effective tax rate for 2021 was 224 compared with 222 for 2020 and 232 for 2019 the increase in our effective tax rate in 2021 from 2020 was primarily due to a lower net gains attributable to noncontrolling interests we continue to see benefit from the phasedin implementation of the 2018 maryland state tax legislation and higher discrete tax benefits associated with the settlement of stockbased awards given the rise in our stock price in 2021 

for 2020 the decrease in our effective tax rate from 2019 was primarily due to the phasedin benefit of the 2018 maryland state tax legislation has had on our effective state tax rate and higher discrete tax benefits associated with the settlement of stockbased awards given the rise in our stock price in 2020 

we have realized a net benefit from the maryland legislation which adopted a fiveyear phasein of the single sales factor method of apportionment for calculating income tax for multistate companies doing business in maryland and in the final year of the phase in we expect our 2022 effective state tax rate will be reduced to less than 3 

our effective tax rate will continue to experience volatility in future periods as the tax benefits recognized from stockbased compensation are impacted by market fluctuations in our stock price and timing of option exercises the rate will also be impacted by changes in the proportion of net income that is attributable to our redeemable noncontrolling interests and noncontrolling interests reflected in permanent equity

the nongaap tax rate primarily adjusts for the impact of the consolidated investment products including the net income attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interests our nongaap effective tax rates for 2021 2020 and 2019 were 225  233 240 r espectively 

we currently estimate our gaap effective tax rate for the fullyear 2022 will be in the range of 22 to 25 and our nongaap effective tax rate for the fullyear 2022 will be in the range of 23 to 25 

nongaap information and reconciliation 

we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results these measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business for comparing current results with prior period results and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers however nongaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies 

the following schedules reconcile certain us gaap financial measures for each of the last five years 







page 41 

    

1 these nongaap adjustments remove the impact that the consolidated t rowe price investment products have on our us gaap consolidated statements of income specifically we add back the operating expenses and subtract the investment income of the consolidated t rowe price investment products the adjustment to our operating expenses represents the operating expenses of the consolidated products net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees the adjustment to net income attributable to t rowe price group represents the net income of the consolidated products net of redeemable noncontrolling interests we remove the impact of the consolidated t rowe price investment products as we believe they impact the reader’s ability to understand our core operating results 

2 these nongaap adjustments remove the compensation expense resulting from market valuation changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and the related net gains losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation depreciation of hypothetical investments chosen by participants we use t rowe price investment products to economically hedge the exposure to these market movements we believe it is useful to offset the nonoperating investment income loss realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help the readers ability to understand our core operating results and to increase comparability period to period 

3 this nongaap adjustment removes the transaction costs incurred related to the acquisition of oha management believes adjusting for these charges helps the readers ability to understand the firms core operating results and to increase comparability period to period 

4 this nongaap adjustment represents the other nonoperating income loss and the net gains losses earned on our nonconsolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the supplemental savings plan liability and nonconsolidated seed investments and other investments that are not part of the cash and discretionary investment portfolio we retain the investment gains recognized on our nonconsolidated cash and discretionary investments as these assets and related income loss are considered part of our core operations we believe adjusting for these nonoperating income loss items helps the reader’s ability to understand our core operating results and increases comparability to prior years additionally we do not emphasize the impact of the portion of nonoperating income loss removed when managing and evaluating our core performance 

5 the income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall nongaap effective tax rate of 225 for 2021  233 for 2020 and 240 for 2019  we estimate that our effective tax rate for the fullyear 2022 on a nongaap basis will be in the range of 23 to 25 

6 this nongaap measure was calculated by applying the twoclass method to adjusted net income attributable to 

t rowe price group divided by the weightedaverage common shares outstanding assuming dilution the calculation of net income allocated to common stockholders is as follows

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2021 stockholders’ equity attributable to t rowe price group inc increased from 77 billion to 90 billion tangible book value decreased to 57 billion at december 31 2021 

sources of liquidity 

we have ample liquidity including cash and investments in t rowe price products as follows 



our discretionary investment portfolio is comprised primarily of short duration bond funds which typically yield higher than money market rates and asset allocation products of these cash and discretionary investments 7642 million at december 31 2021 and 6758 million at december 31 2020 were held by our subsidiaries located outside the us cash and discretionary investment portfolio returned gains of 287 million in 2021 as compared to 927 million in 2020 given the availability of our financial resources and cash expected to be generated through future operations we do not maintain an available external source of additional liquidity 

our seed capital investments are redeemable although we generally expect to be invested for several years for the products to build an investment performance history and until unrelated thirdparty investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage 

the cash and investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on how we account for the cash or investment the following table details how our investments including those acquired as part of the oha acquisition relate to where they are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 



1 the consolidated t rowe price investment products are generally those products we provided seed capital at the time of their formation and we have a controlling interest these products generally represent us mutual funds as well as those funds regulated outside the us the 355 million and the 8935 million represent the total value at december 31 2021 of our interest in the consolidated t rowe price investment products the total net assets of consolidated t rowe price investment products at december 31 2021 of 19113 million includes assets of 19628 million less liabilities of 514 million as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in item 8 financial statements of this form 10k 

2 amounts relate to investments acquired as part of the oha acquisition see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

our consolidated balance sheet reflects the cash and cash equivalents investments other assets and liabilities of those t rowe price investment products we consolidate as well as redeemable noncontrolling interests for the 

page 43 

    

portion of these t rowe price investment products that are held by unrelated thirdparty investors although we can redeem our net interest in these t rowe price investment products at any time we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the products to obtain cash for general operations additionally the assets of these t rowe price investment products are not available to our general creditors our interest in these t rowe price investment products was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed we assess the discretionary products and when we decide to liquidate our interest we seek to do so in a way as to not impact the product and ultimately the unrelated thirdparty investors 

in october 2020 uti asset management company limited india one of our equity method investments held an initial public offering in india as part of the offering we sold a portion of our 26 interest and received net proceeds of approximately 280 million and recorded a net gain on the sale of approximately 28 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 subsequent to the sale we have an ownership interest of 23 of uti asset management company india 

uses of liquidity 

on december 29 2021 we paid approximately 25 billion in cash and issued 8815 million of t rowe price group inc common shares approximately 44 million shares to complete the acquisition of oha

since the end of 2018 we have returned 63 billion to stockholders through stock repurchases our regular quarterly dividends and a special dividend of 300 per share in 2021 as follows 



we anticipate property and equipment expenditures for the fullyear 2022 to be about 295 million of which more than threequarters is planned for technology initiatives we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating cash flows and other available resources

certain discretionary investments of 15783 million during 2021 compared to net proceeds of 1817 million during 2020 the remaining change in reported cash flows from investing activities of 370 million is primarily related to the net cash removed from our balance sheet from consolidating and deconsolidating investment products

material cash commitments 

our material cash commitments primarily include our obligations under the supplemental savings plan our lease obligations and other contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations some of these contractual amounts may be cancelable under certain conditions and may involve termination fees we expect to fund these cash commitments from future cash flows from operations 

our obligations under the supplemental savings plan are disclosed on our consolidated balance sheet with more information included in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements our lease obligations are disclosed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements additionally there are unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

while most of our other material cash commitments consist of goods and services used in our operations these commitments primarily consist of obligations related to longterm software licensing and maintenance contracts 

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 80 million the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2021 annual report on form 10k in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

consolidation 

we consolidate all subsidiaries and sponsored investment products in which we have a controlling interest we are deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment our analysis to determine whether an entity is a vie or a voting interest entity voe involves judgment and considers several factors including an entity’s legal organization capital structure the rights of the equity investment holders our ownership interest in the entity and our contractual involvement with the entity we continually review and reconsider our vie or voe conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events such as changes to our ownership interest changes to an entity’s legal structure or amendments to governing documents our vies are primarily sponsored investment products and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities 

we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant our sicav funds and other t rowe price investment products regulated outside the us are determined to be vies in addition in connection with the oha acquisition we acquired certain carried interest entities which are considered vies these carried interest entities hold interests in general partners of affiliated private investment funds that are also vies however the carried interest entities are not the primary beneficiaries to these investment funds at december 31 2021 we consolidated vies with net assets of 21 billion 

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments 

we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti and certain investments in t rowe price investment products for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting whereby we recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed including separately identified intangible assets contingent liabilities and noncontrolling interests based on the fair value estimates as of the date of the acquisition any excess purchase consideration over the fair value of the identified net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill the accounting for business combinations requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets and the fair value of contingent payment obligations during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded in earnings as a result if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values we could experience impairment charges which could be material 

page 48 

    

intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist primarily of investment advisory agreements and trade names we also acquired certain carried interest entities that primarily hold interests in general partners of affiliated private investment funds with capital allocationbased income arrangements the fair values of the acquired advisory agreements and the investments with the capital allocationbased income arrangements are based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the agreements which include significant assumptions about revenue growth rate discount rate and effective tax rate our estimates are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result may differ from actual results in addition we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate amortization expense if our estimates of the economic lives change amortization expense could be accelerated or decelerated 

  

we record contingent consideration resulting from a business combination at its fair value on the acquisition date we generally determine the fair value of the contingent consideration using the monte carlo simulation methodology of valuation each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligations and record increases or decreases in their fair value as an adjustment to operating expenses within the consolidated statements of income changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates and from changes pertaining to the achievement of the defined financial targets significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period accordingly future business and economic conditions as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 

goodwill 

we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one reportable business segment  investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit  our investment advisory business with the completion of the acquisition of oha in december 2021 we are currently evaluating the impact that oha will have on our business reporting and goodwill impairment analysis 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 26932 million as of december 31 2021 including 20275 million of goodwill generated from the oha acquisition given that the oha acquisition closed on december 29 2021 no impairment testing was performed on the related goodwill 

provision for income taxes 

after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined

forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to our revenues net income and earnings per share on common stock changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels our tax rate the timing and expense related to the integration of oha with and into our business and our expectations regarding financial markets future transactions dividends stock repurchases investments new products and services capital expenditures changes in our effective fee rate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic other market conditions and the acquisition of oha readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k annual report further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the us mutual funds subadvised funds separately managed accounts collective investment trusts and other investment products performance fees capital allocationbased income fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment products changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the t rowe price funds and other managed investment products as compared with competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business including our announced plan to establish t rowe price investment management as a separate registered investment adviser and our ability to attract and retain key personnel our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the t rowe price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the t rowe price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any otherthantemporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investees’ net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the us and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the us the pace and level of spending to support key strategic priorities including the integration of oha with and into our business variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses restricted stock units and other equity grants other incentive awards our supplemental savings plan changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure the timing of the assumption of all third party research payments unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as fund and product recordkeeping facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not 

page 50 

    

limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in t rowe price investment products and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity price risk 

our investments in t rowe price investment products are carried at fair value and as such these investments are subject to market risk the following table presents the equity price risk from our investments in t rowe price investment products investments in these products generally moderate market risk as they are diversified and invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price manages its cash and discretionary investments exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among equity and fixed income portfolios in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate we do not actively manage the market risk related to our seed capital investments 

in order to quantify the sensitivity of our investments to changes in market valuations we have chosen to use a variant of each products net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each products net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each of its investment objectives the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of these investments at december 31 2021 was determined by using the lower of each product’s lowest net asset value per share during 2021 or its net asset value per share at december 31 2021 reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all products experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  



any losses arising from the change in fair value of investments in t rowe price products would result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group 

the direct investment in consolidated t rowe price investment products represents our portion of the net assets of the product upon consolidation of these products our direct investment is eliminated and the net assets of the products are combined in our consolidated balance sheet together with redeemable noncontrolling interests which represents the portion of the products that is owned by unrelated thirdparty investors any losses arising from the change in fair value of our direct investments in consolidated t rowe price investment products would also result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group 

further we have investments that are used to economically hedge the change in our supplementary savings plan liability since we are hedging the liability an impact on our net income attributable to t rowe price group would result from any ineffectiveness of this economic hedge 

page 51 

    

currency translation risk 

certain of our investments including a few consolidated t rowe price investment products expose us to currency translation risk when the financial statements are translated into us dollars usd our most significant exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of our equity method investment in uti 1654 million at december 31 2021 utis financial statements are denominated in indian rupees inr and are translated to usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss net of tax of 367 million at december 31 2021 related to our investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several countries outside the us of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than usd associated with these operations although our revenues are predominately realized in usd the majority of our currency translation risk on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2021 related to cash and nonconsolidated investments of 722 million that are denominated in foreign currencies we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

nr  not relevant 



we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financials and other information and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our dedicated inhouse research analysts consider tangible investment factors such as financial information valuation and macroeconomics in tandem with intangible environmental social and corporate governance investment factors 

our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the us and uk with additional staff based in australia hong kong japan singapore and switzerland we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new strategies investment vehicles and other products to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing 

page 5 

    

needs of our investment advisory clients we will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period in 2020 we introduced six new strategies and several new vehicles like our active exchangetraded funds and share classes of existing strategies 

we typically provide seed capital for new investment products to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets the length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment product as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the product from unrelated investors we attempt to ensure that the new investment product has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment products net asset value or its investment performance record at december 31 2020 we had seed capital investments in our products of 12 billion 

we may also close or limit new investments to new investors across t rowe price investment products in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors at present the following strategies which represent about 20 of total assets under management at december 31 2020 are generally closed to new investors 



investment advisory fees 

we provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the us mutual funds clients on a subadvised or separately managed account basis collective investment trusts and other t rowe price products including funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

nearly 64 of our investment advisory fees are earned from our us mutual funds while about 36 of our investment advisory fees are earned from our other investment portfolios ten of our 177 us mutual funds  blue chip growth growth stock capital appreciation new horizons midcap growth largecap growth health sciences international discovery equity income and emerging markets stock  accounted for approximately 30 of our investment advisory revenues in 2020 and approximately 22 of our assets under management at december 31 2020 our largest client account relationship apart from the us mutual funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 7 of our investment advisory revenues in 2020 

us mutual funds 

at december 31 2020 assets under our management in the us mutual funds aggregated 7946 billion an increase of 164 or 1119 billion from the beginning of the year investment advisory services are provided to each us mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the 

t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the us mutual funds regularly review our fee structures 

page 6 

    

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the us mutual funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate for the majority of the us mutual funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the us mutual funds if the combined net assets of these us mutual funds exceed 845 billion the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 281 basis points for the first 845 billion of net assets plus 260 basis points for net assets in excess of 845 billion to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds including the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion the new income and value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 20 billion the capital appreciation fund has its base individual flat rate reduced by 10 on net assets in excess of 275 billion the effective fee rates for each of the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of approximately 60 million or greater in 2020 varied from a low of 21 basis points for the limited duration inflation focused bond fund to a high of 104 basis points for the international discovery fund 

the fee rate of several of the us mutual funds including the targetdate and index funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and as a result our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs in the second quarter of 2020 the fee structure of the target date retirement funds changed that the investment advisory fee revenue is now earned at the target date retirement fund level rather than at the underlying mutual fund level the spectrum funds series we offer have no separate investment advisory fee rather they bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

each us mutual fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer and subtransfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses such as those described above in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured 

additionally we have contractual management fee waivers for certain us mutual funds including nearly all money market funds which could occur under certain specified circumstances unlike traditional expense limits for newly organized funds these waivers will not be recovered by t rowe price in the future further to these contractual fee waivers due to the low interest rate environment in 2020 we voluntarily waived 204 million or less than 1 of our investment advisory fees from certain of our money market mutual funds trusts and other investment portfolios in order to maintain a positive yield for investors we expect to continue to waive fees in 2021 and we currently anticipate that the waivers for the first quarter of 2021 will be at or slightly above the level of waivers experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020 we also expect that the fee waivers for the first quarter of 2021 will represent a highwater mark for fee waivers issued

subadvised funds separate accounts collective investment trusts and other investment products 

our subadvised separate accounts collective investment trusts and other investment products had assets under management of 6759 billion at december 31 2020 an increase of 1518 billion from the beginning of the year other investment products include openended investment products offered to investors outside the us and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us we earn investment management fees from these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided and these investment management fees are computed using the value of assets under management at a contracted annual fee rate or the products effective fee rate for those with a tieredfee rate structure 

the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations end of billing period valuations or monthend average valuations in 2020 approximately 78 of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 15 were based on end of billing period valuations and 7 were based on monthend averages 

our standard subadvised client accounts normally pay a daily tiered rate and their agreement typically provides for termination with 60 days notice for separately managed accounts the fee is generally based on a period ending value and their agreements provide for termination at any time unearned fees paid in advance are refunded upon termination we currently also earn performancebased investment advisory fees on certain separately managed accounts these fees are currently immaterial to our total investment advisory fees and are only recognized when the performance condition has been met this recognition criteria can lead to uneven recognition of performancebased revenue throughout the year 

our uscollective investment trusts sponsored by t rowe price trust company and subscribed to by certain qualified us retirement plans normally pay an allinclusive tiered rate investment management fee computed on a daily basis 

our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other t rowe price products that pay management fees on a daily basis normally provides for termination with 30 days notice the following table details the services provided by certain of our subsidiaries based on our nonus global investment products 



our subsidiaries t rowe price associates t rowe price international t rowe price hong kong t rowe price singapore t rowe price australia and t rowe price japan may also provide subadvised investment management services to those global investment products listed in the table above 

we distribute the products listed in the table above outside the us through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries the fees we earn for distributing and marketing these products are part of our overall investment management fees for managing the product assets we currently recognize any related distribution fees paid to these financial intermediaries in distribution and servicing costs 

administrative distribution and servicing fees

t rowe price trust company also provides administrative trustee services through this entity which is a marylandchartered limited service trust company we serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans our trust vehicles are not mutual funds as such trust requirements can result in lower compliance and administrative costs over other vehicles with a similar investment strategy our trust vehicles include investments in equity fixed income and multiasset assets 

we also provide discretionary and nondiscretionary advisory planning services to individual investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services inc these services are limited in scope and advice recommendations consist solely of mutual funds advised by t rowe price associates or its affiliates that have been selected for inclusion in these services these services include but are not limited to pointintime financial planning asset allocation advice and discretionary advice through a solely digital experience 

certain t rowe price subsidiaries also provide nondiscretionary advisory services to model delivered managed accounts for these model delivered managed accounts we provide the holdings and trades of the portfolio to the sponsor platforms to implement for their clients the assets under advisement in these portfolios predominantly in the united states was 28 billion at december 31 2020 the revenue earned on these services is recorded in administrative fees 

distribution and servicing 

our subsidiary t rowe price investment services trpis is the principal distributor of the us mutual funds and contracts with thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these share classes trpis enters into agreements with each intermediary under which each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries the investor class of all us mutual funds can be purchased in the us on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of equity fixed income and multiasset strategies the i class of certain us mutual funds is designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios this share class limits ordinary operating expenses other than interest expenses related to borrowings taxes and brokerage and any nonextraordinary expenses to 5 basis points for a period of time and there are no external 12b1 or administrative fee payments 

certain of the us mutual funds also offer advisor class and r class shares that are distributed to investors and defined contribution retirement plans respectively these share classes pay 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services in addition those us mutual funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies hedge funds and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services some of these financial institutions have greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services 

in recent years we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies as a result such products have taken market share from active managers while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain we believe there will always be demand for good active management 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship 

human capital 

at t rowe price our people set us apart we thrive because our company culture is based on collaboration and diversity we believe that our culture of collaboration enables us to identify opportunities others might overlook our associates’ knowledge insight enthusiasm and creativity are the reason our clients succeed and our firm excels in order to attract and retain the highest quality talent we develop key talent and succession plans invest in company diversity and inclusion initiatives provide opportunities for our associates to learn and grow provide strong competitive and regionally specific benefits and programs that promote the health and wellness of our associates both personally and financially our diversity and inclusion initiatives have garnered recognitions including pensions  investments 2020 best places to work in money management and best places to work for lgbtq equality by the human rights campaign foundation although we have made progress in our workforce diversity representation we seek to continuously improve in this area our goal is to increase our hiring and the retention and development of talent from groups that are underrepresented in asset management this includes both minorities and women pursuant to this goal each year we establish annual corporate diversity and inclusion goals to continue improving our hiring development advancement and retention of diverse talent and our overall diversity representation at the end of 2020 women comprised 44 of our associates globally in addition at the end of 2020 29 of our us associates were racial and ethnic minorities furthermore we are committed to pay equity for employees doing similar work regardless of gender race or ethnicity and we conduct pay equity analyses on a regular basis and adjust our associates pay accordingly

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

• investment performance if the investment performance of our managed investment portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable thirdparty benchmarks we could lose existing and potential clients and suffer a decrease in assets under management 

• general market declines we derive a significant portion of our revenues from advisory fees on managed investment portfolios a downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management 

page 12 

    

• investor mobility our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time without advance notice and with little to no significant penalty 

• capacity constraints prolonged periods of strong relative investment performance andor strong investor inflows has resulted in and may result in capacity constraints within certain strategies which can lead to among other things the closure of those strategies to new investors 

• investing trends changes in investing trends particularly investor preference for passive or alternative investment products and in retirement savings trends may reduce interest in our products and may alter our mix of assets under management 

• interest rate changes investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income and multiasset investment portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates 

• geopolitical exposure our managed investment portfolios may have significant investments in markets that are subject to risk of loss from political or diplomatic developments government policies civil unrest currency fluctuations illiquidity and capital controls and changes in legislation related to ownership limitations 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition particularly in market segments where our assets are concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

a majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the us mutual funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the us mutual funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each t rowe price mutual fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each t rowe price mutual fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a t rowe price mutual fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the us mutual funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry competitive pressures may result in a loss of clients and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients thereby reducing our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions some of these financial institutions have greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some competitors operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them substantially all of our investment products are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing products 

the market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive investment products as a result investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us while we believe there will always be demand for strong performing active management we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain 

as part of our continued efforts to attract and retain clients we develop and launch new products and services which may require expenditure of resources and may expose us to new regulatory or compliance requirements as well as increased risk of operational or client service errors 

in the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures which we have done selectively in the past revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

page 13 

    

our operations are complex and a failure to properly execute operational processes could have an adverse effect on our reputation and decrease our revenues 

we provide global investment management and administrative services to our clients in certain cases we rely on thirdparty service providers for the execution and delivery of these services there can be no assurance that these vendors will properly perform these processes or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties failure to properly execute or oversee these services could have an adverse impact on our business financial results and reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties or litigation 

new investment strategies investment vehicles distribution channels or other evolutions of our business may increase the risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to control the risks introduced by such changes significant business changes may require us to update our processes or technology and may increase risk to meeting our business objectives in addition our information systems and technology platforms might not be able to accommodate our continued growth and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level if any of these factors were to arise it could disrupt our operations increase our expenses or result in financial exposure regulatory inquiry or reputational damage 

the quantitative models we use may contain errors which could result in financial losses or adversely impact product performance and client relationships 

we use various quantitative models to support investment decisions and investment processes including those related to portfolio management portfolio risk analysis and client investment guidance any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on our business and reputation 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client service our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed actual or perceived failure to adequately address the environmental social and governance esg expectations of our various stakeholders could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers while we maintain policies procedures and controls to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized activities we are subject to the risk that our associates or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures real or perceived conflicts between our clients’ interests and our own as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information may impair our reputation and subject us to litigation or regulatory action any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain clients and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

• expenses incurred in connection with our multiyear strategic plan to strengthen our longterm competitive position 

• variations in the level of total compensation expense due to changes in among other things bonuses stockbased awards employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes our employee count and mix competitive factors market performance and inflation 

• changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the us and further penetrating us distribution channels 

• expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development 

page 14 

    

• changes in the costs incurred for thirdparty vendors that perform certain administrative and operating services 

• changes in expenses that are correlated to our assets under management such as distribution and servicing fees 

• a future impairment of investments that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 

• a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 

• unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad 

• unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill 

• future changes to legal and regulatory requirements and potential litigation and 

• disruptions of thirdparty services such as communications power and mutual fund transfer agent investment management trading and accounting systems 

under our agreements with the us mutual funds we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any t rowe price investment products any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

our hedging strategies utilized to mitigate risk may not be effective which could impact our earnings 

we employ hedging strategies related to our supplemental savings plan in order to hedge the liability related thereto in the event that our hedging strategies are not effective the resulting impact may adversely affect our results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

amendments to tax laws may impact the marketability of the products and services we offer our clients or the financial position of the company 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we cannot predict future changes in the tax regulations to which we are subject and these regulations could have a material impact on our liability or result in increased costs of our tax compliance efforts 

additionally changes in the status of tax deferred investment options including retirement plans taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment products less favorably and reduce investor demand for products and services we offer which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

based on the global nature of our business from time to time we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we have a process to evaluate whether to record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our estimates 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment products and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment products and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our products it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment 

page 15 

    

product offerings and successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment product these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment product as better meeting their particular clients needs we cannot assure that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflicts trade wars tariffs or sanctions terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures pandemics climate change increased severity of weather events and natural disasters and other events outside of our control could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

• decreasing investment valuations in and returns on the investment portfolios that we manage 

• causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive 

• incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our employees 

• interrupting our business operations or those of critical service providers 

• triggering technology delays or failures and 

• requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage replace our facilities and restore our operations 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region colorado springs colorado and in london england in addition we maintain offices with associates in many other global locations including sydney australia hong kong singapore tokyo japan and luxembourg we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur we also rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to financial losses a tarnished reputation and loss of clients that could result in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our business financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected by the 2020 coronavirus outbreak 

beginning in early 2020 global financial markets have been monitoring and reacting to the novel coronavirus pandemic the spread of the coronavirus has created significant volatility uncertainty and economic disruption to the global economy and may impact our business financial condition and results of operations while we have in place robust and wellestablished business continuity plans that address the potential impact to our associates and our facilities and a comprehensive suite of technologies which enable our associates to work remotely and conduct business no assurance can be given that the steps we have taken will continue to be effective or appropriate additionally we must effectively manage the ongoing risks of a remote workforce ensure a safe working environment for associates working onsite in our offices and adequately manage the postpandemic transition from remote to onsite or a hybrid working environment in the event that our associates become incapacitated by the coronavirus our business operations may be impacted which could lead to reputational and financial harm since our revenue is based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management the ultimate impact on global financial markets and our clients’ decisions related to this event could adversely affect the company’s revenue and operating results 

page 16 

    

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

separately from the investments we manage for our clients we currently have a substantial investment portfolio all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant impairments or unrealized losses on these investments in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue strategic transactions in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position and these could pose risks 

from time to time we consider strategic opportunities including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations organizational restructurings joint ventures or similar transactions any of which may impact our business we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify consummate and successfully complete such transactions and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction these initiatives typically involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges to our ongoing business operations in addition acquisitions and related transactions involve risks including unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping additional or new regulatory requirements operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects on our earnings in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 23 investment in uti asset management company ltd uti an indian asset management company and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

we are exposed to risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

• difficulty in managing operating and marketing our international operations 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates which may result in substantial negative effects on assets under our management revenues expenses and assets in our us dollar based financial statements and 

• significant adverse changes in international legal and regulatory environments 

human capital risks 

our success depends on our key personnel and our investment performance and financial results could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our usbased associates do not have employment contracts while our associates outside the us have employment contracts where basic employment terms are confirmed in writing generally our associates can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to attract or retain key personnel 

due to the global nature of our investment advisory business our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions we have near and longterm succession planning processes 

page 17 

    

including programs to develop our future leaders which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent however in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income and potentially result in complex litigation 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations new regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

• as part of the debate in washington dc and in state legislatures there has been increasing focus on the framework of the us retirement system we could experience adverse business impacts if legislative and regulatory changes limit retirement plans to certain products and services or favor certain investment vehicles that we do not offer materially limit retirement savings opportunities or foster substantial outflows from retirement savings plans for nonretirement purposes 

• there has been substantial regulatory and legislative activity at federal and state levels regarding standards of care for financial services firms related to both retirement and taxable accounts actions taken by applicable regulatory or legislative bodies may impact our business activities and increase our costs 

• the federal reserve board has adopted final regulations related to nonbank systemically important financial institutions sifis and other jurisdictions are contemplating similar regulation at this time us regulators have not designated mutual funds or traditional asset managers as nonbank sifis however if any t rowe price fund or t rowe price affiliate was deemed a sifi increased regulatory oversight would apply to our business which may include enhanced capital liquidity leverage stress testing resolution planning and risk management requirements 

• the commodity futures trading commission cftc has adopted rules that would limit the ability of t rowe price investment products to use futures swaps and other derivatives we have registered certain subsidiaries with the cftc subjecting us to additional regulatory requirements and costs but also providing us additional flexibility to utilize such products nonetheless there are still certain limitations on our investment products due to cftc rules 

• there has been increased global regulatory focus on the manner in which intermediaries are paid for distribution of mutual funds changes to longstanding market practices related to fees or enhanced disclosure requirements may negatively impact sales of mutual funds by intermediaries especially if such requirements are not applied to other investment products 

page 18 

    

• we remain subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection of data we maintain concerning our clients and employees these requirements continue to evolve most commonly in ways that increase the complexity and costs of compliance for example california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the ccpa effective in january 1 2020 which among other things significantly increased compliance obligations and the potential penalties for noncompliance and california voters in november 2020 approved a replacement of this law effective january 1 2023 with a new law that expands various requirements 

• after the 2008 financial crisis global regulations on overthecounter derivatives spearheaded by the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act in the united states and european market infrastructure regulation in the european union eu have imposed clearing margin trade reporting electronic trading and recordkeeping requirements on market participants alongside their general stabilizing and riskreducing effect on the markets these requirements have introduced operational complexity and additional costs to derivatives portfolios 

• the revised markets in financial instruments directive mifid ii directive and regulation mifir together “mifid ii” applied across the eu and member states of the european economic area beginning on january 3 2018 implementation of mifid ii has significantly impacted both the structure and operation of eu financial markets some of the main changes introduced under mifid ii include applying enhanced disclosure requirements enhancing conduct of business and governance requirements broadening the scope of pre and post trade transparency increasing transaction reporting requirements transforming the relationship between client commissions and research and further regulation of trading venues compliance with mifid ii has increased operational complexity and increased our costs for example we began to pay for thirdparty investment research used by our ukbased investment manager t rowe price international ltd in 2018 and we now pay for all the research needs of our investment professionals globally 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties and costs from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including client claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

page 19 

    

united kingdom exit from european union 

we have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the united kingdom “uk” to support our global investment management business we have realigned our european union eu and uk operations in response to the uk exit “brexit” from the eu however we cannot predict the ultimate impact of brexit on our operations or our business we remain committed to our clients associates and business expansion across the region 

technology risks 

we require significant quantities and types of technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on significant quantities of technology and in many cases highly specialized or proprietary or thirdparty licensed technology to support our business functions including among others 

• securities analysis 

• securities trading 

• portfolio management 

• client service 

• accounting and internal financial reporting processes and controls 

• data security and integrity and 

• regulatory compliance and reporting 

all of our technology systems including those provided by vendors are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage and other causes a suspension or termination of vendorprovided software licenses or related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems including those provided by vendors were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of clients and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown or disruption in services from a vendor could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and liability to our clients 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many systems andor countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose clients and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses 

we are dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities we maintain to protect our systems and data an externally caused information security incident such as a cyberattack a phishing scam virus ransomware attack denialofservice attack or an attack launched from within the company could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of confidential client or competitive information in addition our thirdparty vendors and other intermediaries with which we conduct business and transmit data could be subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event and we cannot ensure that such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of information in the custody of those third parties 

there have been increasing numbers of publicized cybersecurity incidents in recent years impacting other financial services firms as well as firms in other industries our use of thirdparty vendors and cloud technologies could heighten this risk should the technology operations on which we rely be compromised we may have to make significant investments to upgrade repair or replace our technology infrastructure or thirdparty vendors and may not be able to make such investments on a timely basis although we maintain insurance coverage that we believe 

page 20 

    

is reasonable prudent and adequate for the purpose of our business it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from breaches of security cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity or any resulting disruptions from such events 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard and maintain confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients associates and other parties as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that both inadvertent errors and fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or detected in a timely manner we also leverage cloudbased solutions for the transmission and storage of this information our systems or those of thirdparty service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code additionally authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release or alter confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things 

• seriously damage our reputation 

• allow competitors access to our proprietary business information 

• subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard data of clients associates and other parties 

• result in the termination of contracts by our existing clients 

• subject us to regulatory action and potential litigation and 

• require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach 

furthermore if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to confidential data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal and state laws and foreign regulations governing the protection of personal or confidential data in addition to the eu’s general data protection regulation  other governmental authorities throughout the us and around the world are considering or enacting similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection for example the ccpa came into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and allows consumers to opt out of any sales of their data to third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches additionally the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection use dissemination and security of data each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business or restrict our use or storage of personal information which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in us mutual funds subadvised funds separately managed accounts collective investment trusts and other t rowe price products the other t rowe price products include openended investment products offered to investors outside the us and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us we also provide certain investment advisory clients with related administrative services including distribution mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans brokerage trust services and nondiscretionary advisory services through model delivery 

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and collective investment trusts and other investment products which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations additionally approximately 30 of our operating expenses are impacted by changes in assets under management 

we incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management 

the general trend to passive investing has been persistent and accelerated in recent years which has negatively impacted our new client inflows however over the long term we expect wellexecuted active management to play an important role for investors in this regard we remain debtfree with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities we are investing in key capabilities including investment professionals distribution professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly we provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service 

market trends 

us stocks produced strong returns in 2020 shares fell sharply during the first quarter in response to the global spreading of the coronavirus and severe economic weakness following lockdown measures starting in late march equities rose sharply—and continued climbing throughout the year—in response to massive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures by governments and central banks around the world as well as some economic reopening efforts toward the end of the year investor sentiment was lifted further by reduced political uncertainty following former vice president joe biden’s victory over incumbent president donald trump in the november election also investors were encouraged by the beginning of the distribution of some coronavirus vaccines that demonstrated very high efficacy rates in drug trials 

stocks in developed nonus equity markets produced positive returns in us dollar terms but generally lagged us shares local returns to us investors were lifted by a weaker dollar against major nonus currencies in asia most major markets rose japanese shares advanced about 15 in europe most markets also rose but shares in the uk declined more than 10 due to uncertainty for most of the year about the uk’s postbrexit trade relationship with the european union 

emerging markets stocks outperformed developed nonus markets asia outperformed other emerging regions thanks to market strength in south korea taiwan and china in emerging europe turkish and russian shares declined moderately in us dollar terms amid weak currencies versus the greenback latin american shares were mostly weaker with regional heavyweight brazil falling 19 in us dollar terms as the real plunged more than 22 over the last year 

page 25 

    

returns of several major equity market indexes for 2020 are as follows 



1 returns exclude dividends 

global bonds produced mostly positive returns as central banks slashed shortterm interest rates and sovereign bond yields in many countries fell sharply in the us investmentgrade market corporate bonds did best as investors sought attractive yields in a low interest rate environment treasury securities also did well as yields dropped across the yield curve the 10year us treasury note yield decreased from 192 to 093 over the last year asset and mortgagebacked securities produced relatively mild gains high yield corporate bonds and taxfree municipal bonds rose but trailed the broad taxable investmentgrade bond market 

bonds in developed nonus markets produced strong gains in us dollar terms helped by dollar weakness against the euro and to a lesser extent the japanese yen and the british pound bonds in developing markets generally appreciated in us dollar terms though local currency weakness in some countries especially brazil turkey and russia reduced local returns to us investors 

returns of several major bond market indexes for 2020 are as follows 



assets under management 

assets under management ended 2020 at 14705 billion an increase of 2637 billion from the end of 2019 this increase was driven by market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested of 2569 billion and net cash inflows of 56 billion for 2020 in addition we acquired client contracts from pnc bank in september 2020 that added 12 billion of stable value assets under management clients transferred 137 billion in net assets from the us mutual funds to primarily collective investment trusts and other investment products of which 86 billion transferred into the retirement date trusts

investment advisory clients outside the us account for 93 of our assets under management at december 31 2020 and 69 at december 31 2019 

our net cash flows in 2020 reflect net positive flows due to inflows into fixed income and international equity these inflows were partially offset by cash outflows in domestic equity and our multiasset franchise resulting from macroeconomic headwinds including the cares act and ongoing pressure from passive in terms of equity products the cash inflows from international equity offset the cash outflows from domestic equity products from a geography perspective emea and apac regions performed well with positive net flows predominantly in equity in both regions net cash flows for 2019 and 2018 were driven by diversified inflows across distribution channels and geographies the strength of our multiasset franchise and positive flows into fixed income and international equity 

our target date retirement products which are included in the multiasset totals shown above continue to be a significant part of our assets under management assets under management in our target date retirement products as well as net cash inflowsoutflows by vehicle are as follows

results of operations 

the following table and discussion set forth information regarding our consolidated financial results for 2020 2019 and 2018 on a us gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis the nongaap basis adjusts for the impact of our consolidated t rowe price investment products the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability and related economic hedges investment income related to certain other investments and certain nonrecurring charges and gains 



1 the percentage change in nonoperating income is not meaningful nm 

2 see the reconciliation to the comparable us gaap measures at the end of the results of operations section of this managements discussion and analysis 

results overview  2020 as compared to 2019 

investment advisory revenues investment advisory fees are earned based on the value and composition of our assets under management which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows as our average assets under management increase or decrease in a given period the level of our investment advisory fee revenue for that same period generally fluctuates in a similar manner our annualized effective fee rates can be impacted by market or cash flow related shifts among asset and share classes price changes in existing products and asset level changes in products with tieredfee structures 

investment advisory revenues earned in 2020 increased 114 over the comparable 2019 period as average assets under our management increased 1386 billion or 125 to 12479 billion in 2020 we voluntarily waived 204 million or less than 1 of our investment advisory fees from certain of our money market mutual funds trusts and other investment portfolios in order to maintain a positive yield for investors at december 31 2020 combined net assets of the investment portfolios in which we waived fees in 2020 were 239 billion we expect to continue to waive fees in 2021 and we currently anticipate that the waivers for the first quarter of 2021 will be at or slightly 

page 31 

    

above the level of waivers experienced in the fourth quarter of 2020 we also expect that the fee waivers for the first quarter of 2021 will represent a highwater mark for fee waivers issued 

the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 456 basis points in 2020 compared with 461 basis points earned in 2019 our effective fee rate has declined largely due to client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes over the last year and the money market fee waivers these declines were partially offset by performancebased fees earned in 2020 

operating expenses operating expenses were 34610 million in 2020 an increase of 71 over the comparable 2019 period the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a 386 million increase in expense related to the supplemental savings plan from higher market returns higher compensation expenses and our continued strategic investments 

on a nongaap basis our operating expenses in 2020 increased 61 to 33427 million compared with 2019 our nongaap operating expenses do not include the impact of our supplemental savings plan and our consolidated t rowe price investment products see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

in 2021 and beyond we expect to advance our strategic priorities to maintain our position as a global and diversified asset manager a global partner for retirement investors and a provider of integrated investment solutions to embed environmental social and governance principles across the firm to maintain effective processes and controls while becoming an adaptive and agile firm and to become a destination of choice for top talent with a diverse workforce and inclusive culture we have increased our 2021 nongaap operating expense growth range to 812 from the 69 provided in october 2020 as sharp market returns in the fourth quarter of 2020 and current aum levels increased our expectations for aumdriven expenses we could elect to adjust our expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise including significant market movements 

operating margin our operating margin in 2020 was 442 compared with 425 in 2019 the increase in our operating margin in 2020 compared with 2019 is primarily driven by higher net revenues partially offset by higher compensationrelated expenses 

diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share was 998 in 2020 as compared to 870 in 2019 the 147 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by higher operating income lower weighted average outstanding shares and a lower effective tax rate these drivers of the increase were partially offset by lower net investment gains recognized in 2020 than in 2019 

on a nongaap basis diluted earnings per share was 958 in 2020 as compared to 807 for 2019 the increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share was primarily due to higher operating income lower weighted average outstanding shares and a lower effective tax rate the impact of these drivers were partially offset by lower net investment gains recognized in 2020 than in 2019 see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

results overview  2019 as compared to 2018 

investment advisory revenues in 2019 investment advisory revenues increased 54 over the comparable 2018 period as average assets under our management increased 728 billion or 70 to 11093 billion 

the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 461 basis points in 2019 compared with 468 basis points earned in 2018 our effective fee rate declined in part due to client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes and to a lesser extent fee reductions we made to certain mutual funds and other products since 2018 further contributing to our lower effective fee rate in 2019 was a greater percentage of our assets under management in lower fee products due to lower equity valuations in the fourth quarter of 2019 

operating expenses for 2019 operating expenses were 32309 million as compared with 30112 million in the 2018 period the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to our continued strategic investments and higher bonus and stockbased compensation which were driven by our 2019 operating results the 2018 period also includes the nonrecurring 152 million reduction in operating expenses related to the conclusion of the dell appraisal rights matter 

page 32 

    

in 2019 our nongaap operating expenses increased 41 to 31498 million compared with 2018 see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

operating margin our operating margin in 2019 was 425 compared with 440 in 2018 the decrease in our operating margin in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by the higher percentage growth in operating expenses related to our supplemental savings plan as compared with the percentage growth in net revenues during 2019 

diluted earnings per share diluted earnings per share was 870 in 2019 as compared with 727 in 2018 the 197 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by higher nonoperating income the benefit realized from increased share buybacks which lowered the weightedaverage shares outstanding and a lower effective tax rate 

on a nongaap basis diluted earnings per share were 807 in 2019 as compared with 715 in 2018 the 129 increase in nongaap diluted earnings per share in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by higher operating income higher investment income earned on our cash and discretionary investment portfolio and lower weightedaverage shares outstanding see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

net revenues 



investment advisory fees the relationship between the change in average assets under management and the change in investment advisory fee revenue for 2020 2019 and 2018 are presented below 



in general strong market returns in 2020 shifted the asset and share class mix among different fee rates and products including those with tieredfee structures additionally we have reduced the management fees of certain products over the last few years 

page 33 

    

in 2020 the relationship between us mutual funds average assets under management and investment advisory fee growth was impacted by the money market fees waivers and client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes 

for the subadvised funds separate accounts collective investment trusts and other investment products 2020 inflows into our international products which have a higher fee rate relative to other products and performancebased fees earned on certain separate accounts drove investment advisory revenues to outpace the increase in average assets under management these investment advisory revenues include distributionrelated services we provide to the international products and then contract with thirdparty intermediaries to distribute these products the costs we incur to pay the thirdparty intermediaries are recorded as part of distribution and servicing expenses 

in 2019 equity markets outperformed fixed income markets resulting in a shift of the us mutual fund average asset mix to higher fee equity products over 2018 strong market returns in 2019 and us mutual fund to trust transfers have primarily increased average assets under management for our subadvised funds separate accounts collective investment trusts and other products however lower incremental fee rates on higher average assets and growth in lower fee share classes resulted in slower revenue growth in 2019 over 2018 

administrative distribution and servicing fees administrative distribution and servicing fees in 2020 were 5136 million an increase of 82 million from 2019 the higher expense was primarily due to increased transfer agent servicing activities provided to our us mutual funds this increase was partially offset by lower 12b1 revenue earned on certain share classes including the advisor and r classes of the us mutual funds as compared to 2019 as well as client transfers to lower fee vehicles and share classes have reduced assets under management in these share classes the decrease in 12b1 revenue is offset entirely by a reduction in the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries that source these assets and is reported in distribution and servicing expense 

for 2019 administrative distribution and servicing fees were 5054 million a decrease of 166 million from the comparable 2018 period the decrease was primarily attributable to lower 12b1 revenue earned on certain share classes including the advisor and r classes of the us mutual funds as client transfers to lower fee vehicles and share classes have reduced assets under management in these share classes 

net revenues are presented after the elimination of 99 million for 2020 68 million for 2019 and 62 million for 2018 earned from our consolidated t rowe price investment products the corresponding expenses recognized by these consolidated products were also eliminated from operating expenses 

operating expenses 



1 the percentage change in nonrecurring net recoveries related to dell appraisal rights matter is not meaningful nm 

compensation and related costs compensation and related costs increased 2132 million or 108 for 2020 as compared with 2019 the increase in compensation and related costs was primarily due to an 830 million increase in salaries benefits and related employee costs as our average staff size increased 58 from prior year and we made modest increases to base salaries at the beginning of the year strong 2020 operating results led to a 655 million increase in our annual variable compensation primarily bonus compensation and higher stockbased 

page 34 

    

compensation expense these increases in compensation and related costs were partially offset by 304 million in higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software in 2020 the 386 million in higher expense related to our supplemental savings plan from strong market returns is partially offset by the nonoperating gains on the investments used to economically hedge the related liability 

for 2019 compensation and related costs increased 1606 million or 89 as compared with 2018 nearly half of the increase in compensation and related costs is attributable to 788 million in higher expense related to our supplemental savings plan given the strong equity market returns experienced in 2019 compared with the sharp equity market declines in late 2018 the higher expense related to the supplemental savings plan is partially offset by the nonoperating gains earned on the investments used to economically hedge the related liability we also experienced increases in base salaries benefits and related employee costs of 660 million as our average staff size grew 31 in 2019 and we modestly increased base salaries at the beginning of 2019 our 2019 operating results led to a 288 million increase in annual variable compensation primarily bonus compensation as well as a 95 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense these increases in compensation and related costs were offset in part by the absence of the onetime 90 million bonus paid to certain associates in the second quarter of 2018 and 100 million in higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software in 2019 

distribution and servicing costs distribution and servicing costs were 2785 million for 2020 an increase of 160 million or 61 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily driven by higher distribution costs as a result of continued inflows into our international products including our japanese itms and sicavs these higher distribution costs were partially offset by client transfers largely from advisor and r classes to vehicles that dont pay distribution and servicing costs 

distribution and servicing costs were 2625 million for 2019 a decrease of 187 million or 67 compared with 2018 the decrease was primarily driven by client transfers largely from advisor and r classes to vehicles that dont pay distribution and servicing costs 

distribution and servicing costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries that source the assets of certain share classes of our us mutual funds and our international products such as our japanese itms and sicavs are recognized in this expense both of these costs are offset entirely by the revenue we earn and report in net revenues 12b1 revenue recognized in administrative distribution and servicing fees for the us mutual funds and investment advisory fee revenue for our international products 

advertising and promotion advertising and promotion costs were 837 million for 2020 a decrease of 131 million or 135 compared with 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by lower media costs and fewer conference and promotional events in 2020 as a result of cancellations arising from the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 

for 2019 advertising and promotion costs were 968 million a decrease of 28 million or 28 compared with 2018 the decrease in advertising and promotion costs for 2019 from 2018 is primarily driven by the absence in 2019 of the creation and launch of a media advertising campaign in 2018 

productrelated costs productrelated costs were 1555 million for 2020 an increase of 23 million or 15 compared with 2019 the increase is primarily due to higher expenses related to servicing retirement plan products partially offset by lower costs incurred to provide administrative services to the us mutual funds 

productrelated costs were 1532 million for 2019 a decrease of 39 million or 25 compared with 2018 the decrease is primarily due to lower costs incurred to provide administrative services to the us mutual funds partially offset by higher operating costs of our collective investment trusts as client transfers have increased the number of trusts and their average net assets over the last year 

technology occupancy and facility costs technology occupancy and facility costs were 4448 million for 2020 4273 million for 2019 and 3839 million for 2018 the increases over the last two years were due primarily to ongoing investment in our technology capabilities including related depreciation and hosted solution licenses as well as office expansion costs the 2019 year included certain nonrecurring office facility costs 

general administrative and other costs general administrative and other costs were 3161 million for 2020 3219 million for 2019 and 2960 million for 2018 higher thirdparty investment research costs professional fees 

page 35 

    

and other administrative related costs in 2020 were more than offset by lower travelrelated expenses 

for 2019 the increase in general administrative and other costs from 2018 was a result of continued investment in our strategic initiatives higher thirdparty investment research costs and other growing operational and regulatory demands on the business 

nonoperating income 

net nonoperating investment income decreased 438 million in 2020 compared with 2019 and increased 5171 million in 2019 compared with 2018 net nonoperating investment activity for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 comprised the following 



despite the global economies and market disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 strong markets for the remainder of 2020 reversed net investment losses experienced in the first quarter and generated significant gains by the end of 2020 our consolidated investment products and supplemental savings plan hedge portfolio comprised almost 70 of the net gains recognized in 2020 our cash and discretionary investments generated income of 927 million in 2020 as compared to 1260 million in 2019 as the very low interest environment reduced the dividends earned from our money market fund investments 

during 2019 nonoperating income reflected the sharp market returns which resulted in significant unrealized gains on our investment portfolio including our consolidated investment portfolios compared with losses in 2018 partially offsetting the market increases was the absence in 2019 of the realized gain from the sale of our 10 holding in daiwa sb investments ltd that was recognized in 2018 our cash and discretionary investments generated income of 1260 million in 2019 as compared to 328 million in 2018 

page 36 

    

the impact of consolidating certain t rowe price investment products on the individual lines of our consolidated statements of income for 2020 2019 and 2018 is as follows 



provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2020 was 222 compared with 232 for 2019 and 258 for 2018 the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2020 from 2019 was primarily due to a lower effective state tax rate as we continue to see phasedin benefit of the 2018 maryland state tax legislation and higher discrete tax benefits associated with the settlement of stockbased awards given the rise in our stock price in 2020 

for 2019 the decrease in the effective tax rate from 2018 was primarily due to higher net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests related to our consolidated t rowe price investment products as these earnings are not taxable to us as well as a lower state tax rate from the maryland state legislation in 2018 and the absence in 2019 of the 2018 nonrecurring charges related to the enactment of us tax reform 

on april 24 2018 the state of maryland enacted new state tax legislation this new state tax legislation effective in 2018 adopted a fiveyear phasein of the single sales factor method of apportionment for calculating income tax for multistate companies doing business in maryland and is expected to result in a net benefit over time accordingly we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 79 million during 2018 for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of this maryland state tax legislation based on information currently available we expect that the maryland state tax legislation will reduce our effective state tax rate over the fiveyear phasein period to less than 3 

the following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



1 state income tax benefits are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and stockbased compensation plans activity 

our effective tax rate will continue to experience volatility in future periods as the tax benefits recognized from stockbased compensation are impacted by market fluctuations in our stock price and timing of option 

page 37 

    

exercises the rate will also be impacted by changes in our consolidated investment products that are driven by market fluctuations and changes in the proportion of their net income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests 

the nongaap tax rate primarily adjusts for the impact of the consolidated investment products including the net income attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interests our nongaap effective tax rates for 2020 2019 and 2018 were 233 for 2020 240 for 2019 241 for 2018 similar to our gaap rate the decrease in our 2020 nongaap effective tax rate from 2019 is due primarily to a lower effective state tax rate and higher discrete tax benefits associated with option exercises 

we currently estimate our gaap effective tax rate for the fullyear 2021 will be in the range of 22 to 25 and our nongaap effective tax rate for the fullyear 2021 will be in the range of 23 to 25 

nongaap information and reconciliation 

we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results these measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business for comparing current results with prior period results and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers however nongaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies 

the following schedules reconcile certain us gaap financial measures for each of the last five years 





page 38 

    







1 these nongaap adjustments remove the impact that the consolidated t rowe price investment products have on our us gaap consolidated statements of income specifically we add back the operating expenses and subtract the investment income of the consolidated t rowe price investment products the adjustment to our operating expenses represents the operating expenses of the consolidated products net of the elimination of related management and administrative fees the adjustment to net income attributable to t rowe price group represents the net income of the consolidated products net of redeemable noncontrolling interest we remove the impact of the 

page 39 

    

consolidated t rowe price investment products as we believe they impact the reader’s ability to understand our core operating results 

2 these nongaap adjustments remove the compensation expense from market valuation changes in the supplemental savings plan liability and the related net gains losses on investments designated as an economic hedge against the related liability amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation depreciation of hypothetical investments chosen by participants we use t rowe price investment products to economically hedge the exposure to these market movements we believe it is useful to offset the nonoperating investment income loss realized on the hedges against the related compensation expense and remove the net impact to help the readers ability to understand our core operating results and to increase comparability period to period 

3 this nongaap adjustment represents the other nonoperating income loss and the net gains losses earned on our nonconsolidated investment portfolio that are not designated as economic hedges of the supplemental savings plan liability and beginning in the second quarter of 2018 nonconsolidated seed investments and other investments that are not part of the cash and discretionary investment portfolio in the second quarter of 2018 we decided to retain the investment gains recognized on our nonconsolidated cash and discretionary investments as these assets and related income loss are considered part of our core operations the impact on previously reported nongaap measures is immaterial we believe adjusting for these nonoperating income loss items helps the reader’s ability to understand our core operating results and increases comparability to prior years additionally we do not emphasize the impact of the portion of nonoperating income loss removed when managing and evaluating our core performance 

4 during the second quarter of 2018 we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 208 million for an adjustment made to the charge taken in 2017 related to the enactment of us tax reform we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to 

t rowe price group and diluted earnings per share 

5 during the second quarter of 2018 we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 79 million for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of maryland state tax legislation enacted on april 24 2018 we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to t rowe price group and diluted earnings per share 

6 in 2016 we recognized a nonrecurring charge net of insurance recoveries of 662 million related to our decision to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter in 2017 we recognized additional insurance recoveries of 50 million as a reduction in operating expenses during 2018 we recognized an additional reduction in operating expenses of 152 million upon recovering a portion of the payments we made to our clients in 2016 we believe it is useful to our readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for these charges and nonrecurring recoveries in arriving at adjusted operating expenses net operating income provision for income taxes net income attributable to t rowe price group and diluted earnings per share 

7 the income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall nongaap effective tax rate of 233 for 2020 240 for 2019 241 for 2018 347 for 2017 and 366 for 2016 we estimate that our effective tax rate for the fullyear 2021 on a nongaap basis will be in the range of 23 to 25 

8 this nongaap measure was calculated by applying the twoclass method to adjusted net income attributable to 

t rowe price group divided by the weightedaverage common shares outstanding assuming dilution the calculation of net income allocated to common stockholders is as follows 



page 40 

    

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2020 stockholders’ equity increased from 71 billion to 77 billion tangible book value increased to 70 billion at december 31 2020 

sources of liquidity 

we remain debtfree with ample liquidity including cash and investments in t rowe price products as follows 



our discretionary investment portfolio is comprised primarily of short duration bond funds which typically yield higher than money market rates and asset allocation products of these cash and discretionary investments 6758 million at december 31 2020 and 6658 million at december 31 2019 were held by our subsidiaries located outside the us cash and discretionary investment portfolio returned gains of 928 million in 2020 as compared to 1260 million in 2019 as the very low interest rate environment reduced the dividend income earned on our money market investments given the availability of our financial resources and cash expected to be generated through future operations we do not maintain an available external source of additional liquidity 

our seed capital investments are redeemable although we generally expect to be invested for several years for the products to build an investment performance history and until unrelated thirdparty investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage 

the cash and investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on how we account for the cash or investment the following table details how t rowe price group’s interests in cash and t rowe price investment products relate to where they are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 



1 the consolidated t rowe price investment products are generally those products we provided seed capital at the time of their formation and we have a controlling interest these products generally represent us mutual funds as well as those funds regulated outside the us the 2051 million and the 8710 million represent the total value at december 31 2020 of our interest in the consolidated t rowe price investment products the total net assets of consolidated t rowe price investment products at december 31 2020 of 26378 million includes assets of 26955 million less liabilities of 577 million as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

our consolidated balance sheet reflects the cash and cash equivalents investments other assets and liabilities of those t rowe price investment products we consolidate as well as redeemable noncontrolling interests for the

portion of these t rowe price investment products that are held by unrelated thirdparty investors although we can redeem our net interest in these t rowe price investment products at any time we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the products to obtain cash for general operations additionally the assets of these t rowe price investment products are not available to our general creditors our interest in these t rowe price investment products was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed we assess the discretionary products and when we decide to liquidate our interest we seek to do so in a way as to not impact the product and ultimately the unrelated thirdparty investors 

additionally in october 2020 uti asset management company limited india one of our equity method investmentsheld an initial public offering in india as part of the offering we sold a portion of our 26 interest and received net proceeds of approximately 280 million and recorded a net gain on the sale of approximately 28 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 subsequent to the sale we have an ownership interest of 23 of uti asset management company india

net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group totaled 13564 million in 2019 a decrease of 3533 million compared with 17099 million in 2018 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a 3846 million decrease in the number of common stock repurchases we made in 2019 due to the stronger equity markets the decrease was partially offset by a 396 million increase in dividends paid in 2019 as a result of an 86 increase in our quarterly dividend per share from 2018 the remaining change in reported cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to a 533 million increase in net subscriptions received from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders of our consolidated investment products during 2019 compared to 2018 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of our supplemental savings plan existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2020 the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2021 and future years the information also excludes the 267 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 



1 these obligations represent the amount of future expected funding requirements related to our supplemental savings plan payment periods are based on deferral elections made by participants if no deferral election has been made the obligation has been included in the thereafter column as the timing of distributions will be determined upon termination of employment we economically hedge this liability and the related market exposure with investments in certain t rowe price products the carrying value of these investments at december 31 2020 was 7681 million and was reported within the investments line on our consolidated balance sheet either these investments or future cash flows from operations are expected to be used to fund the future liability payments 

2 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations 

page 45 

    

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 123 million at december 31 2020 the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2020 annual report on form 10k in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

consolidation 

we consolidate all subsidiaries and t rowe price investment products in which we have a controlling interest we are deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment our analysis to determine whether an entity is a vie or a voting interest entity voe involves judgment and considers several factors including an entity’s legal organization capital structure the rights of the equity investment holders our ownership interest in the entity and our contractual involvement with the entity we continually review and reconsider our vie or voe conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events such as changes to our ownership interest changes to an entity’s legal structure or amendments to governing documents our vies are primarily t rowe price investment products and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities 

we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant our sicav funds and other t rowe price investment products regulated outside the us are determined to be vies at december 31 2020 we consolidated vies with net assets of 24 billion 

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments 

we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti and certain investments in t rowe price investment products for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

goodwill 

we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds 

page 46 

    

our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million as of december 31 2020 

provision for income taxes 

after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined

forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to our revenues net income and earnings per share on common stock changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels our tax rate and our expectations regarding financial markets future transactions dividends stock repurchases investments new products and services capital expenditures changes in our effective fee rate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and other market conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k annual report further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the us mutual funds subadvised funds separately managed accounts collective investment trusts and other investment products fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment products changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans and the impact of the coronavirus outbreak the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the t rowe price funds and other managed investment products as compared with competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business including our recently announced plan to establish t rowe price investment management as a separate registered investment adviser our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the t rowe price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the t rowe price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income will also 

page 47 

    

fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any otherthantemporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investees net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the us and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the us the pace and level of spending to support key strategic priorities variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses restricted stock units and other equity grants other incentive awards our supplemental savings plan changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure the timing of the assumption of all third party research payments unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as fund and product recordkeeping facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in t rowe price investment products and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

equity price risk 

during the first quarter of 2020 the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic began to rapidly spread throughout the world and caused increasing disruption to populations economic activity and the global financial markets while markets recovered sharply since that time the impact and ongoing uncertainty related to the pandemic continued into the end of 2020 since our investments in t rowe price investment products are carried at fair value these investments are subject to market risk the following table presents the equity price risk from our investments in t rowe price investment products investments in these products generally moderate market risk as they are diversified and invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price manages its cash and discretionary investments exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among equity and fixed income portfolios in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate we do not actively manage the market risk related to our seed capital investments 

in order to quantify the sensitivity of our investments to changes in market valuations we have chosen to use a variant of each products net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each products net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each of its investment objectives the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of these investments at december 31 2020 was determined by using the lower of each product’s lowest net asset value per share during 2020 or its net asset value per share at december 31 2020 reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all products experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  

page 48 

    



any losses arising from the change in fair value of investments in t rowe price products would result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group 

the direct investment in consolidated t rowe price investment products represents our portion of the net assets of the product upon consolidation of these products our direct investment is eliminated and the net assets of the products are combined in our consolidated balance sheet together with redeemable noncontrolling interests which represents the portion of the products that is owned by unrelated thirdparty investors any losses arising from the change in fair value of our direct investments in consolidated t rowe price investment products would also result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group 

further we have investments that are used to economically hedge the change in our supplementary savings plan liability since we are hedging the liability an impact on our net income attributable to t rowe price group would result from any ineffectiveness of this economic hedge 

currency translation risk 

certain of our investments including a few consolidated t rowe price investment products expose us to currency translation risk when the financial statements are translated into us dollars usd our most significant exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of our equity method investment in uti 1455 million at december 31 2020 utis financial statements are denominated in indian rupees inr and are translated to usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss net of tax of 436 million at december 31 2020 related to our investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several countries outside the us of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than usd associated with these operations although our revenues are predominately realized in usd the majority of our currency translation risk on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2020 related to cash and nonconsolidated investments of 952 million that are denominated in foreign currencies we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

the following table sets forth our broad investment capabilities as of december 31 2019  



we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financials and other information and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our dedicated inhouse research analysts consider tangible investment factors such as financial information valuation and macroeconomics in tandem with intangible environmental social and corporate governance investment factors

commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new strategies investment vehicles and other products to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period in 2019 we introduced six new strategies and several new vehicles and share classes of existing strategies 

we typically provide seed capital for new investment products to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets the length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment product as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the product from unrelated investors we attempt to ensure that the new investment product has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment product s net asset value or its investment performance record at december 31 2019  we had seed capital investments in our products of 13 billion  

conversely we may also close or limit new investments to new investors across t rowe price investment products in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors at present the following strategies which represent about 20 of total assets under management at december 31 2019  are generally closed to new investors 



 this fund will reopen for new accounts in the second quarter of 2020 

investment advisory fees 

we provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the us mutual funds clients on a subadvised or separately managed account basis and other t rowe price products  including collective investment trusts funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

nearly 70 of our investment advisory fees are earned from our us mutual funds while about 30 of our investment advisory fees are earned from our other investment portfolios ten of our 181 us mutual funds  blue chip growth  growth stock  capital appreciation  midcap growth  new horizons  value  emerging markets stock  overseas stock  equity income  and institutional largecap growth   accounted for approximately 35 of our investment advisory revenues in 2019  and approximately 27 of our assets under management at december 31 2019  our largest client account relationship apart from the us mutual funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 7 of our investment advisory revenues in 2019  

us mutual funds 

at december 31 2019  assets under our management in the us mutual funds aggregated 6827 billion  an increase of 209 or 1182 billion from the beginning of the year investment advisory services are provided to each us mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the 

page 6 

cl3q64v9cmg 

t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the us mutual funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the us mutual funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate for the majority of the us mutual funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the us mutual funds if the combined net assets of these us mutual funds exceed 650 billion  the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 286 basis points for the first 650 billion of net assets plus 265 basis points for net assets in excess of 650 billion  to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds including the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion the new income and value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 20 billion the capital appreciation fund has its base individual flat rate reduced by 10 on net assets in excess of 275 billion the effective fee rates for each of the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of approximately 60 million or greater in 2019  varied from a low of 15 basis points for the us treasury longterm fund to a high of 104 basis points for the emerging markets stock and international discovery funds 

the fee rate of several of the us mutual funds including the index funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and as a result our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs the funds in the spectrum funds series and in the multiple target date retirement funds series that we offer have no separate investment advisory fee rather they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

each us mutual fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer and subtransfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses such as those described above in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured 

additionally we have contractual management fee waivers for certain us mutual funds including nearly all money market funds which could occur under certain specified circumstances unlike traditional expense limits for newly organized funds these waivers will not be recovered by t rowe price in the future

subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products 

our subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products had assets under management of 5241 billion at december 31 2019  an increase of 1263 billion from the beginning of the year other investment products include collective investment trusts openended investment products offered to investors outside the us and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us we earn investment management fees from these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided and are computed using the value of assets under management at a contracted annual fee rate or the products effective fee rate for those with a tieredfee rate structure the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations end of billing period valuations or monthend average valuations in 2019  approximately 79 of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 13 were based on end of billing period valuations and 8 were based on monthend averages 

our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other t rowe price products that pay management fees on a daily basis normally provides for termination with thirty days notice our standard separately managed account agreements provide for termination at any time and the refunding of any unearned fees paid in advance our standard subadvised client account agreement typically provides for termination with sixty days notice 

the following table details the services provided by certain of our subsidiaries based on our nonus global investment products 



our subsidiaries t rowe price associates t rowe price international t rowe price hong kong as well as t rowe price australia and t rowe price japan may also provide subadvised investment management services to those global investment products listed in the table above 

we distribute the products listed in the table above outside the us through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries the fees we earn for distributing and marketing these products are part of our overall investment management fees for managing the product assets we currently recognize any related distribution fees paid to these financial intermediaries in distribution and servicing costs 

in addition to providing investment management services to the us mutual funds our subsidiaries t rowe price associates and t rowe price international offer separately managed institutional investment management and subadvised investment management services to global intermediaries our subsidiary t rowe price trust company offers and provides investment management services to our t rowe price collective investment trusts which are used in the investment portfolios of certain qualified us retirement plans 

administrative distribution and servicing fees 

administrative services 

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting distribution and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in us mutual funds  recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the t rowe price complex brokerage and trust services

t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the us mutual funds the t rowe price collective investment trusts and funds outside the t rowe price complex t rowe price retirement plan services also provides transfer agent services to the us mutual funds the pricing on these transfer agent services is based on basis points of the related assets under management plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the us mutual funds and outside fund families compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the respective funds as of december 31 2019  we provided recordkeeping services for 210 billion in assets under administration of which nearly 128 billion are assets we manage 

t rowe price trust company provides administrative trustee services through this entity which is a marylandchartered limited service trust company we serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans 

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist investors in staying on track to achieve their financial goals 

distribution and servicing 

the investor class of all us mutual funds can be purchased in the us on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of equity fixed income and multiasset strategies the i class of certain us mutual funds is designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios this share class limits ordinary operating expenses other than interest expenses related to borrowings taxes and brokerage and any nonextraordinary expenses to 5 basis points for a period of time and there are no external 12b1 or administrative fee payments 

certain of the us mutual funds also offer advisor class and r class shares that are distributed to investors and defined contribution retirement plans respectively these share classes pay 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services trpis is the principal distributor of the us mutual funds and contracts with thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these share classes trpis enters into agreements with each intermediary under which each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries in addition those us mutual funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in the administrative distribution and servicing fees line of 

our consolidated statements of income we also recognize the corresponding cost paid to the thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these funds share classes within the distribution and servicing costs line of the consolidated statements of income the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees earned from the mutual funds we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of our investment products these costs are recognized when incurred and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media television and digital and social media advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including the enhancement of our digital capabilities

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies hedge funds and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services some of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services 

in recent years we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies as a result such products have taken market share from active managers while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain we believe there will always be demand for good active management 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship 

employees 

at december 31 2019  we employed 7365 associates up 49 from the 7022 associates employed at the end of 2018  we may add temporary and parttime personnel to our staff from time to time to meet periodic and special project demands primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative services

risk factors 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the us mutual funds and other investment products  our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity products  there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased products at the low end and emerging markets products at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income products  though not as widely as equity products  with stable value products and money market products at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bond products at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition particularly in market segments where our assets are concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely 

page 12 

cl3q64v9cmg 

decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the us mutual funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the us mutual funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each t rowe price mutual fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each t rowe price mutual fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a t rowe price mutual fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the us mutual funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry competitive pressures may result in a loss of customers and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients thereby reducing our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions some of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some competitors operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them substantially all of our investment products are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing products  

the market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive investment products as a result investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us while we believe there will always be demand for good active management we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain 

if current or potential customers decide to move their assets to one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income in the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures which we have done selectively in the past revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our usbased associates do not have employment contracts while our associates outside the us have employment contracts where basic employment terms are confirmed in writing generally our associates can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to attract or retain key personnel 

due to the global nature of our investment advisory business our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions we have near and longterm succession planning processes including programs to develop our future leaders which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent however in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

page 13 

cl3q64v9cmg 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational processes could have an adverse effect on our reputation and decrease our revenues 

we provide investment management product administration product recordkeeping and tax reporting services to our clients in certain cases we rely on thirdparty vendors in the execution and delivery of these services there can be no assurance that these vendors will properly perform these processes or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties failure to properly execute or oversee these services could subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties or litigation 

new investment strategies investment vehicles distribution channels or other evolutions of our business may increase the risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to control the risks introduced by such changes significant business changes may require us to update our processes or technology and may increase risk to meeting our business objectives in addition our information systems and technology platforms might not be able to accommodate our continued growth and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level if any of these factors were to arise it could disrupt our operations increase our expenses or result in financial exposure regulatory inquiry or reputational damage 

the quantitative models we use may contain errors which could result in financial losses or adversely impact product performance and client relationships 

we use various quantitative models to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management and activities any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on our business and reputation 

changes to benchmark indices may impact our business 

the manner in which certain reference rates are calculated could impact the investment portfolios we manage the withdrawal and replacement of widely used benchmark indices such as the london interbank offered rate “libor” with alternative benchmark rates may introduce a number of risks for our business the fca in the uk which regulates libor has announced that it will no longer compel panel banks to submit rates for libor after 2021 changes in the method pursuant to which libor is determined or the discontinuance of libor may adversely affect the amount of interest payable or interest receivable on certain portfolio investments these changes may also impact the market liquidity and market value of these portfolio investments 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client service our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed additionally we are subject to the risk that our employees or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures real or perceived conflicts between our clients’ interests and our own as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information may impair our reputation and subject us to litigation or regulatory action any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 



page 14 

cl3q64v9cmg 

 

under our agreements with the us mutual funds we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any t rowe price investment products  any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

amendments to tax laws may impact the marketability of the products and services we offer our clients or the financial position of the company 

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincomebased taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we cannot predict future changes in the tax regulations to which we are subject and these regulations could have a material impact on our liability or result in increased costs of our tax compliance efforts 

additionally changes in the status of tax deferred investment options including retirement plans taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment products less favorably and reduce investor demand for products and services we offer which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

based on the global nature of our business from time to time we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we have a process to evaluate whether to record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our estimates 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment products and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment products  and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our products  it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial 

page 15 

cl3q64v9cmg 

planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment product  these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment product as better meeting their particular clients needs we cannot assure that our investment products will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflicts trade wars tariffs or sanctions terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures climate change and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region and in london england in addition we maintain offices with associates in many other global locations such as sydney australia hong kong singapore tokyo japan and luxembourg we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur we also rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial investment portfolio all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant impairments and the recognition of unrealized losses related to t rowe price products that are consolidated or accounted for under the equity method in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue strategic transactions in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position and these could pose risks 

from time to time we consider strategic opportunities including potential acquisitions dispositions consolidations organizational restructurings joint ventures or similar transactions any of which may impact our business we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify consummate and successfully complete such transactions and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction these initiatives typically involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges to our ongoing business operations in addition acquisitions and related transactions involve risks including unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping additional or new

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us and have an equity investment in uti our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations new regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

 

 



page 17 

cl3q64v9cmg 

regulators have not designated mutual funds or traditional asset managers as nonbank sifis however if any t rowe price fund or t rowe price affiliate was deemed a sifi increased regulatory oversight would apply to our business which may include enhanced capital liquidity leverage stress testing resolution planning and risk management requirements 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income

cl3q64v9cmg 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

united kingdom exit from european union 

we have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the united kingdom “uk” to support our global investment management business the ultimate impact of the uk exit “brexit” from the european union “eu” on our business operations in the uk and europe could vary depending on the details of the separation agreement or any subsequent trade relationship between the uk and eu while we cannot predict the outcome at this time we have realigned our eu and uk operations so that we are as prepared if the eu and uk are unable to reach a separation agreement or future trade agreement we remain committed to our clients associates and business expansion across the region 

  

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary or thirdparty licensed technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

all of our technology systems including those provided by vendors are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage and other causes a suspension or termination of vendorprovided software licenses or related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses 

we are dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities we maintain to protect our systems and data an externally caused information security incident such as a 

page 19 

cl3q64v9cmg 

cyberattack a phishing scam virus ransomware attack or denialofservice attack could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information in addition our thirdparty vendors and other intermediaries with which we conduct business and transmit data could be subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event and we cannot ensure that such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of information in the custody of those third parties 

there have been increasing numbers of publicized cybersecurity incidents in recent years impacting other financial services firms as well as firms in other industries our use of thirdparty vendors and cloud technologies could heighten this risk should our technology operations be compromised we may have to make significant investments to upgrade repair or replace our technology infrastructure and may not be able to make such investments on a timely basis although we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable prudent and adequate for the purpose of our business it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from breaches of security cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity or any resulting disruptions from such events 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard and maintain sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients associates and other parties as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or detected in a timely manner we also leverage cloudbased solutions for the transmission and storage of this information our systems or those of thirdparty service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code additionally authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things 

 

furthermore if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to personal or confidential data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal and state laws and foreign regulations governing the protection of personal or confidential data in addition to the eu’s general data protection regulation  other governmental authorities throughout the us and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection for example the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the “ccpa came into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and allows consumers to opt out of any sales of their data to third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches additionally the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the collection use dissemination and security of data each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business or restrict our use or storage of personal information which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in us mutual funds  subadvised funds separately managed accounts and other t rowe price products  the other t rowe price products include collective investment trusts openended investment products offered to investors outside the us and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment products  which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations additionally approximately onethird of our operating expenses are impacted by financial markets we incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management 

the general trend to passive investing has been persistent and accelerated in recent years which has negatively impacted our new client inflows however over the long term we expect wellexecuted active management to play an important role for investors in this regard we remain debtfree with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities we are investing in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly we provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future 

market trends 

us stocks surged in 2019 as equities bounced back strongly from deep losses in the fourth quarter of 2018 a major driver of market performance was the federal reserve’s decision to keep shortterm interest rates steady in the first half of the year then reduce rates three times starting in late july as a “midcycle adjustment” of its monetary policy many other central banks around the world also reduced rates in response to slowing economic growth the trade conflict between the us and china was another major driver of market sentiment markets wavered at times through much of the year as both sides announced new tariffs on the other’s goods speculation then arose in the fall that the us and china were close to reaching an agreement but a preliminary “phase one” trade deal was not reached until december 

stocks in developed nonus equity markets rose strongly but underperformed us shares european stocks were widely positive uk shares advanced more than 21 but lagged the region as brexitrelated uncertainty persisted for most of the year boris johnson succeeded theresa may as prime minister during the summer but the house of commons did not vote in favor of the united kingdom’s withdrawal agreement with the european union until december shortly after the conservative party decisively won a general election returns in developed asian markets were broadly positive in us dollar terms hong kong underperformed the region with a 10 gain hong kong’s economy and stock market have been hurt by ongoing protests that were triggered by a controversial extradition bill 

emerging markets stocks underperformed shares in developed markets asian equities were mostly positive in us dollar terms but most markets significantly lagged strong returns in china and taiwan in emerging europe russian stocks surged about 53 turkish stocks lagged with a 12 gain in latin america stocks in colombia and brazil posted very strong returns but shares in argentina and chile fell sharply

results of several major equity market indexes for 2019 are as follows 



1 returns exclude dividends 

global bond returns were broadly positive as longerterm government bond yields in developed markets declined and various central banks enacted new stimulus measures in the us the federal reserve reduced the federal funds target rate to a range of 150175 by the end of the year the 10year treasury note yield decreased from 269 to 192 at yearend though above its latesummer lows which were around 150 

in the us the investmentgrade bond market longterm treasuries and corporate bonds fared best mortgagebacked securities advanced to a lesser extent hindered by an increase in mortgage prepayments and refinancing activity municipal bonds did well amid solid demand but slightly underperformed taxable securities high yield bonds advanced strongly for the year as investors embraced riskier assets and searched for higher yields because of falling interest rates 

bonds in developed nonus markets produced positive returns in us dollar terms as the dollar weakened against most major currencies and government bond yields generally declined in the eurozone the european central bank decided to cut its shortterm benchmark rate deeper into negative territory in september on november 1 the european central bank resumed its quantitative easing program and began purchasing €20 billion of securities every month emerging markets debt appreciated strongly in dollar terms bonds denominated in us dollars outperformed local currency debt as a few key emerging markets currencies declined against the dollar

results overview 

investment advisory revenues investment advisory fees are earned based on the value and composition of our assets under management which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows as our average assets under management increase or decrease in a given period the level of our investment advisory fee revenue for that same period generally fluctuates in a similar manner our annualized effective fee rates can be impacted by market or cash flow related shifts among asset and share classes price changes in existing products and asset level changes in products with tieredfee structures 

investment advisory revenues earned in 2019 increased 54 over the comparable 2018 period as average assets under our management increase d 728 billion  or 70  to 11093 billion  the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 461 basis points in 2019  compared with 468 basis points earned in 2018  our effective fee rate has declined largely due to client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes over the last year and to a lesser extent fee reductions we made to certain mutual funds and other products since 2018  we regularly assess the competitiveness of our investment advisory fees and will continue to make adjustments as deemed appropriate 

in 2018  investment advisory revenues increased 129 over the comparable 2017 period as average assets under our management increased 1275 billion  or 140  to 10365 billion  the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 468 basis points in 2018  compared with 473 basis points earned in 2017  our effective fee rate declined in part due to client transfers within the complex to lower fee vehicles or share classes and to a lesser extent fee reductions we made to certain mutual funds and other products since 2017  further 

page 30 

cl3q64v9cmg 

contributing to our lower effective fee rate in 2018 was a greater percentage of our assets under management in lower fee products due to lower equity valuations in the fourth quarter of 2018  

operating expenses operating expenses were 32309 million in 2019  an increase of 73 over the comparable 2018 period  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to greater marketrelated compensation expense related to the supplemental savings plan liability higher salaries and benefits higher bonus and stockbased compensation expense and the cost of our continued strategic investments the 2018 period also includes the nonrecurring 152 million reduction in operating expenses related to the conclusion of the dell appraisal rights matter the higher expense related to the supplemental savings plan in 2019 is partially offset by nonoperating gains earned on the investments used to hedge the related liability 

for 2018  operating expenses were 30112 million as compared with 27461 million in the 2017 period the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to our continued strategic investments and higher bonus and stockbased compensation which were driven by our 2018 operating results 

on a nongaap basis our operating expenses in 2019 increased 41 to 31498 million compared with 2018  in 2018  our nongaap operating expenses increased 89 to 30255 million compared with 2017  our nongaap operating expenses exclude the impacts of our supplemental savings plan investment income related to certain other investments our consolidated t rowe price investment products and certain nonrecurring items see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

our 2017 and 2018 operating expenses include certain financial impacts related to the dell appraisal rights matter as further discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements a summary of the financial impact of the dell appraisal rights matter on our annual pretax operating expenses and pretax operating cash flows since the matter arose in 2016 is as follows 



there was no operating expense or cash flows impact related to the dell appraisal rights matter in 2019 

in 2020  we expect to advance our strategic priorities to sustain and deepen our investment talent add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally we currently expect our 2020 nongaap operating expenses to grow in the range of 6 to 9 this expense growth guidance includes continued investments in the business and technology capabilities our cost optimization efforts and the final part of the phased implementation of paying for all thirdparty investment research as such 2020 operating expenses will reflect a full year of all thirdparty investment research costs globally we could elect to adjust our expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise including significant market movements 

operating margin our operating margin in 2019 was 425  compared with 440 in 2018 and 434 in 2017  the decrease in our operating margin in 2019 compared with 2018 is primarily driven by the higher compensation expense growth related to our supplemental savings plan as compared with the percentage growth in net revenues during 2019  the increase in our operating margin in 2018 compared to 2017 was driven by the higher percentage growth in net revenue attributable primarily to increases in our average assets under management compared with the percentage growth in operating expenses 

diluted earnings per share was 870 in 2019  727 in 2018  and 597 in 2017  the 197 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by higher nonoperating income the benefit realized from increased share buybacks which lowered the weightedaverage shares outstanding and a lower effective tax rate the 218 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2018 compared with 2017 was driven by higher operating income and the benefit realized from a lower corporate tax rate under us tax reform 

page 31 

cl3q64v9cmg 

on a nongaap basis diluted earnings per share were 807 in 2019  715 in 2018 and 543 in 2017 the 129 increase in nongaap diluted earnings per share in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by higher operating income higher investment income earned on our cash and discretionary investment portfolio and lower weightedaverage shares outstanding see our nongaap reconciliations later in this managements discussion and analysis section 

net revenues 



investment advisory fees investment advisory fees are earned based on the value and composition of our assets under management which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows as our average assets under management increase or decrease in a given period the level of our investment advisory fee revenue for that same period generally fluctuates in a similar manner the relationship between the change in average assets under management and the change in investment advisory fee revenue for 2019  2018 and 2017 are presented below 



market fluctuations and net cash flows can shift the asset and share class mix among different fee rates and products including those with tieredfee structures over the last few years we have also reduced the management fees of certain products 

while equity markets outperformed fixed income markets in 2019 and resulted in a shift of the us mutual fund average asset mix to higher fee equity products over 2018 lower incremental fee tiered rates and certain fund price reductions created lower incremental revenues strong market returns in 2019 and us mutual fund to trust transfers have primarily increased average assets under management for our subadvised and separate accounts and other products however lower incremental fee rates on higher average assets and growth in lower fee share classes resulted in slower revenue growth in 2019 over 2018 

in 2018 investment advisory fees earned on our subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products grew slower relative to average assets under management as a result of the significant client transfers from mutual funds to lower fee vehicles 

page 32

administrative distribution and servicing fees administrative distribution and servicing fees represent fees earned from providing administrative and distribution services to our investment advisory clients primarily us mutual funds and their investors for 2019  these fees were 5054 million  a decrease of 166 million from the comparable 2018 period  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower 12b1 revenue earned on certain share classes including the advisor and r classes of the us mutual funds as client transfers to lower fee vehicles and share classes has reduced assets under management in these share classes the decrease in 12b1 revenue is offset entirely by a reduction in the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries that source these assets and is reported in distribution and servicing expense in addition higher recordkeeping fees and transaction fees were partially offset by lower mutual fund service revenues 

for 2018  administrative distribution and servicing fees were 5220 million  a decrease of 371 million from the comparable 2017 period the decrease was primarily attributable to lower assets under management in the us mutual funds resulting from client transfers among vehicles and share classes and the sharp market decline at the end of 2018 

net revenues include the elimination of 68 million for 2019  62 million for 2018  and 56 million for 2017  earned from our consolidated t rowe price investment products  the corresponding expenses recognized by these consolidated products were also eliminated from operating expenses

compensation and related costs compensation and related costs increased 1606 million  or 89  for 2019 as compared with 2018  nearly half of the increase in compensation and related costs is attributable to 788 million in higher expense related to our supplemental savings plan given the strong equity market returns experienced in 2019 compared with the sharp equity market declines in late 2018 the higher expense related to the supplemental savings plan is partially offset by the nonoperating gains earned on the investments used to economically hedge the related liability we also experienced increases in base salaries benefits and related employee costs of 660 million as our average staff size grew 31 in 2019 and we modestly increased base salaries at the beginning of 2019  our 2019 operating results led to a 288 million increase in annual variable compensation primarily bonus compensation as well as a 95 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense these increases in compensation and related costs were offset in part by the absence of the onetime 90 million bonus paid to certain associates in the second quarter of 2018 and 100 million in higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software in 2019 

for 2018  compensation and related costs increased 1437 million  or 86  as compared with 2017  the largest part of the increase was an increase base salaries benefits and related employee costs of 771 million resulting from an increase of 62 in average headcount combined with a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2018 our operating results led to a 680 million increase in variable compensation and contributed to the 450 million increase in noncash stockbased compensation expense as the annual grant value was higher in 2018  additionally our 2018 equity grant reflected the adoption of more favorable postretirement vesting provisions which shifted a greater percentage of the expense related to the annual grant to be recognized for 2018  the 2018

period also included 90 million in onetime bonuses paid to certain associates from us tax reform benefits these increases were partially offset by lower marketrelated expense of 303 million from our supplemental savings plan and higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software 

distribution and servicing costs distribution and servicing costs includes those costs incurred to distribute the t rowe price products as well as client and shareholder servicing recordkeeping and administrative services distribution and servicing costs were 2625 million for 2019  a decrease of 187 million  or 67  compared to 2018  the decrease for 2019 from 2018 was primarily driven by client transfers largely from advisor and r classes to lower fee vehicles or share classes during 2019  which resulted in lower assets under management in those mutual funds on which we pay distribution and servicing costs these costs include those distribution and servicing costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries that source the assets of certain share classes of our us mutual funds and is offset entirely by the 12b1 revenue we earn and report in administrative distribution and servicing fees 

distribution and servicing costs were 2812 million for 2018  an increase of 186 million  or 71  compared with 2017  the increase was primarily driven by overall strong markets and net cash flows from the end of 2017 through the third quarter of 2018 which grew the assets in those share classes and products for which we pay a related distribution and servicing fee 

advertising and promotion advertising and promotion costs were 968 million for 2019  a decrease of 28 million  or 28  compared with 2018  the decrease for 2019 from 2018 was primarily driven by the absence in 2019 of the creation and launch of a media advertising campaign in 2018 

advertising and promotion costs were 996 million for 2018  an increase of 72 million  or 78  compared with 2017  the increase in advertising and promotion costs for 2018 from 2017 is primarily driven by the creation and launch of a media advertising campaign in 2018 

productrelated costs productrelated costs consists of nonadvisory related costs that we incur to service certain t rowe price products productrelated costs were 1532 million for 2019  a decrease of 39 million  or 25  compared with 2018  the decrease is primarily due to lower costs incurred to provide administrative services to the us mutual funds partially offset by higher operating costs of our collective investment trusts as client transfers have increased the number of trusts and their average net assets over the last year 

productrelated costs were 1571 million for 2018  an increase of 111 million  or 76  compared with 2017  the increase is primarily due to higher operating costs of our collective investment trusts as client transfers have increased the number of trusts and their average net assets over the last year also contributing to the increase were higher costs incurred to provide administrative services to the us mutual funds 

technology occupancy and facility costs technology occupancy and facility costs consists of depreciation expense technology equipment and maintenance software and costs related to our facilities these costs were 4273 million for 2019  3839 million for 2018  and 3505 million for 2017  the increases over the last two years were due primarily to additional incremental investment in our technology capabilities including related depreciation and hosted solution licenses as well as office expansion costs the 2019 year also included certain nonrecurring office facility costs that were recognized in the fourth quarter 

general administrative and other costs general administrative and other costs consist of costs associated with the overall management of the firm including information services professional services travel and entertainment research costs and other general operating expenses these costs were 3219 million for 2019  2960 million for 2018  and 2797 million for 2017  the increases for 2019 from 2018 and for 2018 from 2017 were a result of our continued investment in our strategic initiatives higher thirdparty investment research costs and other growing operational and regulatory demands on the business

nonoperating income 

net nonoperating investment income increased 5171 million for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with 2018 and decreased 3731 million for the year ended december 31 2018 compared with 2017  net nonoperating investment activity for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 comprised the following 



during 2019  nonoperating income reflected the sharp market returns which resulted in significant unrealized gains on our investment portfolio including our consolidated investment portfolios compared with losses in 2018 partially offsetting the market increases was the absence in 2019 of the realized gain from the sale of our 10 holding in daiwa sb investments ltd that was recognized in 2018  our cash and discretionary investments generated income of 1260 million in 2019 as compared to 328 million in 2018  

during 2018  nonoperating income included the impact of sharp market declines in the later part of 2018 which resulted in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio including our consolidated products compared with unrealized gains recognized during 2017 partially offsetting these losses was the recognition during 2018 of a realized gain in other investment income associated with the sale of our 10 holding in daiwa sb investments ltd additionally on january 1 2018 we implemented new accounting guidance that eliminated the availableforsale investment category for equity securities as a result of this change realized gains of 831 million from the sale of certain availableforsale investments recognized in 2017 did not reoccur in 2018

the impact of consolidating certain t rowe price investment products on the individual lines of our consolidated statements of income for 2019  2018  and 2017 is as follows 



provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2019 was 232  compared with 258 for 2018 and 369 for 2017  the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2019 from 2018 was primarily due to higher net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests related to our consolidated t rowe price investment products as these earnings are not taxable to us as well as a lower state tax rate from the maryland state legislation in 2018 and the absence in 2019 of the 2018 nonrecurring charges related to the enactment of us tax reform the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 on january 1 2018 following the enactment on december 22 2017 of a comprehensive us tax reform bill known as the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform for 2018 and 2017 the income tax provision includes nonrecurring charges of 208 million and 711 million  respectively related to the enactment of us tax reform as we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability estimates 

on april 24 2018 the state of maryland enacted new state tax legislation this new state tax legislation effective in 2018  adopted a fiveyear phasein of the single sales factor method of apportionment for calculating income tax for multistate companies doing business in maryland and is expected to result in a net benefit over time accordingly we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 79 million during 2018 for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of this maryland state tax legislation based on information currently available we expect that the maryland state tax legislation will reduce our effective state tax rate over the fiveyear phasein period to less than 3

1 state income tax benefits are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and stockbased compensation plans activity 

our effective tax rate will continue to experience volatility in future periods as the tax benefits recognized from stockbased compensation are impacted by market fluctuations in our stock price and timing of option exercises the rate will also be impacted by changes in our consolidated investment products that are driven by market fluctuations and changes in the proportion of their net income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests we currently estimate our effective tax rate for the fullyear 2020 will be in the range of 23 to 26

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2019  stockholders’ equity increase d from 61 billion to 71 billion  tangible book value increased to 64 billion at december 31 2019  

sources of liquidity 

we remain debtfree with ample liquidity including cash and investments in t rowe price products as follows 

our discretionary investment portfolio is comprised primarily of short duration bond funds which typically yield higher than money market rates and asset allocation products cash and discretionary investments generated income of 1260 million in 2019 as compared to 328 million in 2018  cash and discretionary investments in t rowe price products held by our subsidiaries outside the us were 6658 million at december 31 2019  and 6345 million at december 31 2018  given the availability of our financial resources and cash expected to be generated through future operations we do not maintain an available external source of additional liquidity 

our seed capital investments are redeemable although we generally expect to be invested for several years for the products to build an investment performance history and until unrelated thirdparty investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage

the cash and investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on how we account for the cash or investment the following table details how t rowe price group’s interests in cash and t rowe price investment products relate to where they are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019

392 million as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this form 10k 

our consolidated balance sheet reflects the cash and cash equivalents investments other assets and liabilities of those t rowe price investment products we consolidate as well as redeemable noncontrolling interests for the portion of these t rowe price investment products that are held by unrelated thirdparty investors although we can redeem our net interest in these t rowe price investment products at any time we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the products to obtain cash for general operations additionally the assets of these t rowe price investment products are not available to our general creditors our interest in these t rowe price investment products was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed we assess the discretionary products and when we decide to liquidate our interest we seek to do so in a way as to not impact the product and ultimately the unrelated thirdparty investors 

uses of liquidity 

we paid 304 per share in regular dividends in 2019  an increase of 86 over the 280 per share paid in 2018  additionally we expended 7088 million in 2019 to repurchase 70 million shares or 29  of our outstanding common stock at an average price of 10165 per share these dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations we will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans 

since the end of 2016 we have returned 43 billion to stockholders through stock repurchases and our regular quarterly dividends as follows 



we anticipate property and equipment expenditures for the fullyear 2020 to be up to 210 million  of which about threequarters is planned for technology initiatives we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating cash flows and other available resources

operating activities attributable to t rowe price group during 2018 provided cash flows of 21781 million an increase of 6263 million from the 2017 period the increase in these operating cash flows was driven by 6416 million of higher net income after adjusting for significant noncash activity including depreciation expense stockbased compensation expense and market gains on investments adjustments for market gains on investments decreased during 2018 in part due to a change in accounting guidance that we adopted on january 1 2018 the remaining decrease in investment gain activity is due to lower gains as a result of weaker equity markets in 2018 compared with 2017  additionally during 2017  we invested 2186 million into certain investment products to establish an economic hedge of our supplemental savings plan liability and invested an additional 1295 million in 2018 in order to maintain it the remaining 1044 million decrease in operating cash flows attributable to t rowe price group relates to timing differences on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities including the settlement of insurance receivables during 2017 related to the dell appraisal rights matter the remaining change in reported cash flows from operating activities was attributable to the net change in trading securities held in our consolidated investment products’ underlying portfolios

net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group were 13564 million in 2019  a decrease of 3535 million compared with 17099 million in 2018  the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by a 3846 million decrease in the number of common stock repurchases we made in 2019 due to the stronger equity markets this decrease was partially offset by a 396 million increase in dividends paid in 2019 as a result of an 86 increase in our quarterly dividend per share from 2018 the remaining change in reported cash flows from financing activities is primarily attributable to a 533 million increase in net subscriptions received from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders of our consolidated investment products during 2019 compared to 2018  

net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group totaled 17099 million in 2018 compared with 8201 million in 2017  the increase was primarily driven by spending 6322 million more in common stock repurchases in 2018 as market volatility provided an opportunity to buy back more shares additionally a nearly 23 increase in our quarterly dividend per share resulted in paying 1312 million more in dividends in 2018  the decline in our stock price in 2018 led to fewer stock options being exercised and a 1263 million decrease in related cash proceeds compared with the 2017  the remaining change in reported cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to a 8112 million decrease in net subscriptions received from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders of our consolidated investment products during 2018 compared with the 2017 period

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of our supplemental savings plan existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2019  the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2020 and future years the information also excludes the 239 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 



1 these obligations represent the amount of future expected funding requirements related to our supplemental savings plan payment periods are based on deferral elections made by participants if no deferral election has been made the obligation has been included in the thereafter column as the timing of distributions will be determined upon termination of employment we economically hedge this liability and the related market exposure with investments in certain t rowe price products the carrying value of these investments at december 31 2019 was 5611 million and was reported within the investments line on our consolidated balance sheet either these investments or future cash flows from operations are expected to be used to fund the future liability payments 

2 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations 

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 181 million at december 31 2019  the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2019 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

page 45 

cl3q64v9cmg 

consolidation 

we consolidate all subsidiaries and t rowe price investment products in which we have a controlling interest we are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment our analysis to determine whether an entity is a vie or a voting interest entity voe involves judgment and considers several factors including an entity’s legal organization capital structure the rights of the equity investment holders our ownership interest in the entity and our contractual involvement with the entity we continually review and reconsider our vie or voe conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events such as changes to our ownership interest changes to an entity’s legal structure or amendments to governing documents our vies are primarily t rowe price investment products and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities 

we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant our sicav funds and other t rowe price investment products regulated outside the us are determined to be vies at december 31 2019  we consolidated vies with net assets of 19 billion  

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments 

we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti and certain investments in t rowe price investment products  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

goodwill 

we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million as of december 31 2019  

provision for income taxes 

after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined

in order to quantify the sensitivity of our investments to changes in market valuations we have chosen to use a variant of each product s net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each product s net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each of its investment objectives the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of these investments at december 31 2019 was determined by using the lower of each product ’s lowest net asset value per share during 2019 or its net asset value per share at december 31 2019  reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all product s experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  

any losses arising from the change in fair value of investments in t rowe price products would result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group the direct investment in consolidated t rowe price investment products represents our portion of the net assets of the product  upon consolidation of these products  our direct investment is eliminated and the net assets of the products are combined in our consolidated balance sheet together with redeemable noncontrolling interests which represents the portion of the products that is owned by unrelated thirdparty investors any losses arising from the change in fair value of our direct investments in consolidated t rowe price investment products would also result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group

currency translation risk 

certain of our investments including a few consolidated t rowe price investment products  expose us to currency translation risk when the financial statements are translated into us dollars usd our most significant exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of our equity method investment in uti  1645 million at december 31 2019  utis financial statements are denominated in indian rupees inr and are translated to usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss  net of tax of 469 million at december 31 2019  related to our investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several countries outside the us of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than usd associated with these operations although our revenues are predominately realized in usd the majority of our currency translation risk on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2019  related to cash and nonconsolidated investments of 2846 million that are denominated in foreign currencies we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

financial overview  assets under management 

we derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenue and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries primarily t rowe price associates and t rowe price international ltd our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

page  2

investment management services 

distribution channels and products 

we distribute our products in countries located within three broad geographical regions americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac we accumulate our assets under management from a diversified client base across five primary distribution channels americas financial intermediaries emea and apac financial intermediaries individual us investors on a direct basis us retirement plan sponsors for which we provide recordkeeping services and institutional investors globally investors domiciled outside the us represent about 6  of total assets under management at the end of 2018  we service clients in 48  countries around the world the following table outlines the types of products within each distribution channel through which our assets under management as of december 31 2018  are sourced

investment capabilities 

we manage a broad range of investment strategies in equity fixed income and multiasset across sectors styles and regions our strategies are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of investors and are delivered across a range of vehicles we also offer specialized advisory services including management of stable value investment contracts modeled multiasset solutions and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

page  4 

    

the following table sets forth our broad investment capabilities as of december 31 2018  



we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our dedicated inhouse research analysts consider tangible investment factors such as financial information valuation and macroeconomics in tandem with intangible environmental social and corporate governance investment factors 

our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the us and uk with additional staff based in australia hong kong japan singapore and switzerland we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new strategies investment vehicles and other products  to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period in 2018 we introduced four new strategies and several new vehicles and share classes of existing strategies 

we typically provide seed capital for new investment products  to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets the length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment product  as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the product  from unrelated investors we attempt to ensure that the new investment product  has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment product s net asset value or its investment performance record at december 31 2018  we had seed capital investments of 11 billion  in our products 

page  5 

    

conversely we may also close or limit new investments across all t rowe price investment products  in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors at present the following strategies which represent about 20  of total assets under management at december 31 2018  are generally closed to new investors 



investment advisory fees 

we provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the us mutual funds clients on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and other t rowe price products  including collective investment trusts target date retirement trusts funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

ten of our 179  us mutual funds  growth stock  blue chip growth  midcap growth  capital appreciation  value  new horizons  new income  equity income  overseas stock  and emerging markets stock   accounted for approximately 35  of our investment advisory revenues in 2018  and approximately 28  of our assets under management at december 31 2018  our largest client account relationship apart from the us mutual funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 6  of our investment advisory revenues in 2018  

us mutual funds 

at december 31 2018  assets under our management in the us mutual funds aggregated 5645 billion  a decrease of 69  or 418 billion  from the beginning of the year investment advisory services are provided to each us mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the us mutual funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the us mutual funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate for the majority of the us mutual funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the us mutual funds if the combined net assets of these us mutual funds exceed 650 billion  the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 286 basis points  for the first 650 billion  of net assets plus 265 basis points  for net assets in excess of 650 billion  to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds including the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion the new income and value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15 

page  6 

    

on net assets in excess of 20 billion the capital appreciation fund has its base individual flat rate reduced by 10 on net assets in excess of 275 billion the effective fee rates for each of the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of approximately 60 million  or greater in 2018  varied from a low of 15  basis points for the us treasury longterm fund to a high of 104  basis points for the emerging markets stock and international discovery funds 

the fee rate of several of the us mutual funds including the index and summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and as a result our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs each of the funds in the spectrum funds series and in the multiple target date retirement funds series that we offer invests in a diversified portfolio of other us mutual funds and has no separate investment advisory fee rather they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

each us mutual fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer and subtransfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses such as those described above in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured beginning in 2017 we implemented new contractual management fee waivers for certain us mutual funds including nearly all money market funds which unlike traditional expense limits for newly organized funds these waivers will not be recovered by t rowe price in the future 

subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products 

our subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products  had assets under management of 3978 billion  at december 31 2018  an increase of 130 billion  from the beginning of the year we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other t rowe price products that pay management fees on a daily basis normally provides for termination with thirty days notice our standard separately managed account agreements provide for termination at any time and the refunding of any unearned fees paid in advance our standard subadvised client account agreement typically provides for termination with sixty days notice 

our subsidiaries t rowe price luxembourg management sàrl and t rowe price australia provide management company and investment management services respectively to our luxembourgbased sicavs and fcps and auts t rowe price luxembourg management sàrl and t rowe price international provide authorized corporate depositor and investment management services respectively to our ukbased oeics t rowe price canada provides investment management services to our canadian pooled funds t rowe price japan provides investment management services to our japan investment trust our subsidiaries t rowe price associates and t rowe price hong kong may also provide subadvised investment management services to these global investment products  we distribute several of these products  outside the us through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries the fees we earn for distributing and marketing these products are part of our overall investment management fees for managing the product  assets we currently recognize any related distribution fees paid to these financial intermediaries in distribution and servicing costs 

in addition to providing investment management services to the us mutual funds our subsidiaries t rowe price associates and t rowe price international offer separately managed institutional investment management and subadvised investment management services to global intermediaries our subsidiary t rowe price trust company offers and provides investment management services to our t rowe price collective investment trusts which are used in the investment portfolios of certain qualified us retirement plans 

page  7 

    

our fees for managing these subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products  are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations end of billing period valuations or monthend average valuations in 2018  approximately 78  of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 14  were based on end of billing period valuations and 8  were based on monthend averages 

administrative distribution and servicing fees 

administrative services 

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting distribution and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in us mutual funds  recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the t rowe price complex brokerage and trust services 

t rowe price services provides the us mutual funds transfer agency and shareholder services including the staff facilities technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders the us mutual funds contract directly with bny mellon to provide mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of each mutual funds daily net asset values per share 

t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the us mutual funds the t rowe price collective investment trusts and funds outside the t rowe price complex t rowe price retirement plan services also provides transfer agent services to the us mutual funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the us mutual funds and outside fund families compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the respective funds as of december 31 2018  we provided recordkeeping services for 171 billion  in assets under administration of which 108 billion  are assets we manage 

t rowe price trust company provides administrative trustee services through this entity which is a marylandchartered limited service trust company we serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans 

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist investors in staying on track to achieve their financial goals 

distribution and servicing 

the investor class of all us mutual funds can be purchased in the us on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of equity fixed income and multiasset products  the i class of certain us mutual funds is designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios this share class limits ordinary operating expenses other than interest expenses related to borrowings taxes and brokerage and any nonextraordinary expenses at 5 basis points for a period of time and there are no external payments for 12b1 or administrative fee payments 

certain of the us mutual funds also offer advisor class and r class shares that are distributed to investors and defined contribution retirement plans respectively these share classes pay 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services trpis is the principal distributor of the us mutual funds and contracts with thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these share classes trpis enters into agreements with each intermediary under which each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries in addition those us mutual funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points 

page  8 

    

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in the administrative distribution and servicing fees line of 

our consolidated statements of income we also recognize the corresponding cost paid to the thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these funds share classes within the distribution and servicing costs line of the consolidated statements of income the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees earned from the mutual funds we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of our investment products these costs are recognized when incurred and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media television and digital and social media in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including the enhancement of our digital capabilities

in recent years we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies as a result such products have taken market share from active managers while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain we believe there will always be demand for good active management 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship 

employees

risk factors 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the us mutual funds  and other investment products  our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity products  there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased products  at the low end and emerging markets products  at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income products  though not as widely as equity products  with stable value products  and money market products  at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bond products  at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 



page  11 

    

 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the us mutual funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the us mutual funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each t rowe price mutual fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each t rowe price mutual fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a t rowe price mutual fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the us mutual funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry competitive pressures may result in a loss of customers and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients thereby reducing our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some competitors operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products  offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them most of our investment products  are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing products  

the market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive investment products as a result investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us while we believe there will always be demand for good active management we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain 

if current or potential customers decide to move their assets to one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income in the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures which we have done selectively in the past revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our usbased associates do not have employment contracts while our associates outside the us have employment contracts where basic employment terms are confirmed in writing generally our associates can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to attract or retain key personnel 

page  12 

    

due to the global nature of our investment advisory business our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions we have near and longterm succession planning processes including programs to develop our future leaders which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent however in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational processes could have an adverse effect on our reputation and decrease our revenues 

we provide investment management product  administration product  recordkeeping and tax reporting services to our clients in certain cases we rely on thirdparty vendors in the execution and delivery of these services there can be no assurance that these vendors will properly perform these processes or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties failure to properly execute or oversee these services could subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties or litigation 

new investment products  we introduce could increase the risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to control the risks introduced by such new investment products  in addition our information systems and technology platforms might not be able to accommodate our continued growth and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level materialization of these risks could disrupt our operations increase our expenses or result in financial exposure regulatory inquiry or reputational damage 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client service our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed additionally we are subject to the risk that our employees or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures real or perceived conflicts between our clients’ interests and our own as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information may impair our reputation and subject us to litigation or regulatory action any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 



page  13 

    

 

under our agreements with the us mutual funds we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any t rowe price investment products  any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

amendments to tax laws may impact the marketability of the products and services we offer our clients or the financial position of the company   

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we cannot predict future changes in the tax regulations to which we are subject and these regulations could have a material impact on our liability or result in increased costs of our tax compliance efforts additionally changes in the status of tax deferred investment options including retirement plans taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment products  less favorably and reduce investor demand for products  and services we offer which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods   

based on the global nature of our business from time to time we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we have a process to evaluate whether to record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our estimates 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment products  in the us and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment products  and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our products  it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment product  these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment product  as better meeting their particular clients needs we cannot assure that our investment products  will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflicts terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures climate change and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 



page  14 

    

 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region and in london england we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that those preparations will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur we also rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial investment portfolio all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant impairments and the recognition of unrealized losses related to t rowe price products  that are consolidated or accounted for under the equity method in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue acquisition and investment opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position and these could pose risks 

we consider opportunistic acquisitions to grow existing business add new technologies or expand distribution we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping additional or new regulatory requirements operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects on earnings in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 26 investment in uti asset management company ltd uti an indian asset management company and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

we are exposed to risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us and have an equity investment in uti our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 



page  15 

    

 the quantitative models we use may contain errors which could result in financial losses or adversely impact product performance and client relationships   

we use various quantitative models to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management and activities any errors in the underlying models or model assumptions could have unanticipated and adverse consequences on our business and reputation 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations new regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

 

 

 



page  16 

    

without additional registration if we are required to register we would be subject to additional regulatory requirements and costs associated with registration 

 

 

 

 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could 

page  17 

    

adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

united kingdom exit from european union 

we have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the united kingdom “uk” to support our global investment management business the ultimate impact of the uk exit “brexit” from the european union “eu” on our business operations in the uk and europe could vary depending on the details of the separation agreement while we cannot predict the outcome at this time we are in the process of realigning our eu and uk operations so that we are as prepared if the eu and uk are unable to reach a separation agreement we remain committed to our clients associates and business expansion across the region 

  

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary or thirdparty licensed technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

all of our technology systems including those provided by vendors are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage and other causes a suspension or termination of vendorprovided software licenses or related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

a cyberattack or a failure to implement effective information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses   

we are dependent on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies procedures and capabilities we maintain to protect our systems and data an externally caused information security incident such as a cyberattack a phishing scam virus or denialofservice attack could materially interrupt business operations or cause disclosure or modification of sensitive or confidential client or competitive information in addition our thirdparty vendors could be subject to a successful cyberattack or other information security event and we cannot ensure that such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of information in the custody of those vendors should our technology operations be compromised we may have to make significant investments to upgrade repair or replace our technology infrastructure and may not be able to make such investments on a timely basis although we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is reasonable prudent and 

page  18 

    

adequate for the purpose of our business it may be insufficient to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from breaches of security cyberattacks and other types of unlawful activity or any resulting disruptions from such events 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or detected in a timely manner we also leverage cloudbased solutions for the transmission and storage of this information our systems or those of thirdparty service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code additionally authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things 

 

furthermore if any person including any of our employees negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal and state laws and foreign regulations governing the protection of client data in addition to gdpr other governmental authorities throughout the us and around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection for example in june 2018 the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act of 2018 the ccpa which will come into effect on january 1 2020 the ccpa requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and allows consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches additionally the federal trade commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection use dissemination and security of data each of these privacy security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations require changes to our business or restrict our use or storage of personal information which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in us mutual funds  separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other t rowe price products  the other t rowe price products include collective investment trusts target date retirement trusts openended investment products offered to investors outside the us and products  offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment products  which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations we incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management 

the general trend to passive investing has been persistent and accelerated in recent years which has negatively impacted our new client inflows however over the long term we expect wellexecuted active management to play an important role for investors in this regard we remain debtfree with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities we are investing in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly are providing our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future 

in 2019 we expect to advance our strategic priorities to sustain and deepen our investment talent add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally we currently expect our 2019 nongaap operating expenses to grow in the range of 4 to 7 this expense growth range factors in continued investments in the business our cost optimization efforts and the incremental cost of paying for all thirdparty investment research as and when implemented we could elect to adjust our expense growth should unforeseen circumstances arise including significant market movements 

market trends 

us stocks declined in 2018 the worst year for the us equity market since 2008 stocks rose for much of the year but market volatilitystemming from rising shortterm interest rates and heightened global trade tensions especially between the us and chinawas relatively high while most major us stock indexes reached alltime highs around the end of the third quarter equities plunged in the final months of the year with several indexes falling into or close to bear market territory down at least 20 from recent highs by the end of the year the market faltered amid forecasts for slowing corporate earnings growth in 2019 and fears that the federal reserve would continue to raise interest rates in 2019 even if indications of softness in the us economy emerge 

stocks in developed nonus equity markets fared worse than us shares japanese shares dropped almost 13 as the exportoriented country was hurt by global trade tensions throughout the year and japan’s economic contraction in the third quarter european stocks declined over 14 in us dollar terms amid political turmoil slowing growth and global trade tensions 

emerging markets stocks performed slightly worse than shares in developed nonus markets in asia global trade tensions hurt several emerging markets significantly in emerging europe turkish stocks plummeted roughly 41 as the lira plunged due to factors such as elevated inflation and tensions with the us in latin america brazilian shares ended the year nearly flat after a fourthquarter surge on optimism that brazil’s newly elected president will pursue businessfriendly policies and pension reform mexican stocks fell about 15 amid concerns about the governing style of the country’s new president

investment advisory clients outside the us account for about 6  of our assets under management at 2018  and 2017  and about 5  at december 31 2016 

our net cash flows in 2018 and 2017 were driven by diversified inflows across distribution channels and geographies the strength of our multiasset franchise and positive flows into international equity and fixed income in 2016 subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products net cash outflows prior to client transfers were largely attributable to institutional and intermediary clients reallocating to passive investments and the impact of our closed investment strategies 

our target date retirement products  which are included in the multiasset totals shown above continue to be a significant part of our assets under management net cash flows after client transfers shown above include 120 billion  in 2018  71 billion  in 2017  and 81 billion  in 2016  from target date products  assets under management in these products are as follows

on january 1 2018 we adopted new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition we elected to adopt the new guidance on a retrospective basis which requires 2017  and 2016  results to be recast to reflect the impact accordingly the 2017  and 2016  net revenues and operating expenses presented in the table above and in the narrative that follows have been recast to reflect the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance the new guidance requires certain revenue related expenses that are incurred in servicing our us mutual funds to be recognized in operating expenses versus being presented net against the related revenues as such net revenues and operating expenses primarily productrelated were recast to reflect an increase of 619 million  in both 2017  and 2016  

additionally we modified our income statement presentation in 2018 to increase operating expense transparency and to align expenses that have similar cost drivers prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the new 2018  presentation for more information see note 1  basis of preparation and summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements included later in this annual report on form 10k

results overview   

investment advisory revenues  investment advisory revenues earned in 2018  increased 129  over the comparable 2017 period  as average assets under our management increase d 1275 billion  or 140  to 10365 billion  the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 468 basis points  in 2018  compared with 473 basis points  earned in 2017  our effective fee rate has declined in part due to client transfers to lower fee products or share classes and to a lesser extent fee reductions we made to certain mutual funds and other products during 2018 further contributing to our lower effective fee rate in 2018 was a greater percentage of our assets under management in lower fee products due to lower equity valuations in the fourth quarter we regularly assess the competitiveness of our investment advisory fees and will continue to make adjustments as deemed appropriate 

in 2017  investment advisory revenues increased 150  over the comparable 2016  period as average assets under our management increased 1308 billion  or 168  to 9090 billion  the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 473  basis points in 2017  compared with 480 basis points earned in 2016  our effective fee rate declined primarily due to fee rate reductions we made to certain t rowe price investment products since the end of 2015 and higher equity valuations in funds with tiered individual rates which decrease as assets under management grow this decline in effective fee rate was partially offset by higher equity valuations which resulted in a greater percentage of our assets under management attributable to higher fee equity products while we voluntarily waived 105 million in money market related fees including advisory fees and fund expenses in order to maintain a positive yield for investors in 2016 our voluntary fee waivers were negligible for 2017 

over time our effective fee rate can be impacted by market or cash flow related shifts among asset and share classes price changes in existing products and asset changes in products with tieredfee structures 

operating expenses  operating expenses were 30112 million  in 2018  compared with 27461 million  in the 2017 period  on a nongaap basis our operating expenses in 2018  increased 89  to 30255 million  compared with 2017  the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to continued strategic investments and higher bonus and stockbased compensation which were driven by our operating results 

for 2017  operating expenses were 27461 million  as compared with 25514 million  in the 2016  period on a nongaap basis our operating expenses in 2017  increased 121 to 27777 million  compared with 2016  about onefourth of the increase is related to variable compensation and marketdriven distribution and client servicing costs as a result of the strong market performance in 2017 the remaining change is due to our investments in the strategic initiatives announced in early 2017 and other growing operational and regulatory demands 

our operating expenses in each of the last three years includes some financial impact related to the dell appraisal rights matter as further detailed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements we incurred in 2016  a nonrecurring charge net of insurance recoveries of 662 million  or 15  per share after tax related to payments we made to our clients related to the matter additional insurance recoveries totaling 500 million  or 12  per share after tax were recognized in 2017  finally upon receipt of a nonappealable judgment in the fourth quarter of 2018  we recognized a reduction in operating expenses of 152 million  or 05  per share after tax related to the recovery of a portion of the payments we made to our clients in 2016 a summary of the financial impact of the dell appraisal rights matter on our annual pretax operating expenses and pretax operating cash flows since the matter arose is as follows 



operating margin  our operating margin in 2018  was 440  compared with 434  in 2017  and 405 in 2016  excluding the impacts from the dell appraisal rights matter our operating margin was 437  in 2018 424  in 2017  and 420 in 2016 the increase in our operating margins each year since 2016 is driven by the higher

percentage growth in net revenue attributable primarily to increases in our average assets under management each year compared with the percentage growth in operating expenses 

diluted earnings per share for 2018 was 727  compared with 597  in 2017 the 218 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2018 was driven by higher operating income and the benefit realized from a lower corporate tax rate under us tax reform the 257 increase in diluted earnings per share in 2017 compared with 2016 was driven primarily from our results of operations in 2017 and fewer weighted average outstanding shares assuming dilution 

net revenues 



investment advisory fees  investment advisory fees are earned based on the value and composition of our assets under management which change based on fluctuations in financial markets and net cash flows as our average assets under management increase or decrease in a given period the level of our investment advisory fee revenue for that same period generally fluctuates in a similar manner the relationship between the change in our average assets under management for 2018  2017  and 2016  and the change in our investment advisory fee revenue recognized during each of the same annual periods is presented below 



over the last three years we have reduced the management fees of certain mutual funds and other investment products this is a contributing factor in why investment advisory revenue has generally grown slower than average assets under management in each of these vehicles over the same period additionally significant client transfers from mutual funds to lower fee vehicles or among product share classes in 2017 and 2018 have contributed to the investment advisory fees associated with subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products to grow slower than the related average assets under management market fluctuations and net cash flows over the annual time periods have also shifted the asset and share class mix among different fee rates and products with tieredfee structures 

administrative distribution and servicing fees   administrative distribution and servicing fees  represent fees earned from providing administrative and distribution services to our investment advisory clients primarily us mutual funds and their investors for 2018  these fees were 5220 million  a decrease  of 371 million  from the comparable 2017 period  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower assets under management in the us 

page  31 

    

mutual funds resulting from client transfers among vehicles and share classes and the sharp market decline at the end of 2018 

for 2017  administrative distribution and servicing fees were 5591 million  an increase  of 93 million  from the comparable 2016  period the increase was primarily attributable to higher transfer agent and distribution servicing revenue due to client transfers among vehicles and share classes 

the distribution and servicing fees we earn are related to 12b1 plans of certain classes including the advisor and r classes of our us mutual funds and are entirely offset by the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported in the distribution and servicing cost line in the consolidated income statements 

net revenues include the elimination of 62 million  for 2018  56 million  for 2017  and 65 million  for 2016  earned from our consolidated t rowe price investment products  the corresponding expenses recognized by these consolidated products were also eliminated from operating expenses

compensation and related costs  compensation and related costs increased   1437 million  or 86  for 2018  as compared with 2017  the largest part of the increase was an increase in base salaries benefits and related employee costs of 771 million resulting from an increase of 62  in average headcount combined with a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2018 our operating results led to a 680 million increase in annual variable compensation and contributed to the 450 million increase in noncash stock based compensation expense as the annual grant value was higher in 2018 additionally our 2018 equity grant reflected the adoption of more favorable postretirement vesting provisions which shifted a greater percentage of the expense related to the annual grant to be recognized for 2018 the 2018 period also includes 90 million in onetime bonuses paid to certain associates from us tax reform benefits these increases were partially offset by lower marketrelated expense of 303 million from our supplemental savings plan and higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software 

for 2017 compensation and related costs increased 1709 million  or 114  as compared with 2016  the largest part of the change is attributable to a 1169 million increase in salaries and related benefit expenses which resulted primarily from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2017 combined with a 64 increase in average headcount from 2016 the higher employee benefit expenses also includes increased health care costs as well as greater equity awardrelated payroll taxes due to the significant rise in our stock price during 2017 higher average headcount also drove up recruiting costs for 2017 compared with the 2016 period our annual variable compensation for the 2017 period rose 598 million over the 2016 period stronger markets during 2017 increased the supplemental savings plan liability resulting in additional compensation expense of 211 million for 2017 compared with the 2016 period the increases in these compensation and related costs were offset in part by higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software for 2017 compared with the 2016 period as we continue to invest in our technology capabilities we had a reduction in our noncash stock based compensation expense for 2017 as we shifted our annual grant from twice a year to a single grant in december

distribution and servicing costs   distribution and servicing  costs includes those costs incurred to distribute the t rowe price products as well as client and shareholder servicing recordkeeping and administrative services these costs were 2812 million  for 2018  2626 million  for 2017  and 2334 million  for 2016  the increases for 2018  from 2017  and for 2017  from 2016  are primarily driven by strong markets and net cash flows from the end of 2016 through the third quarter of 2018 which grew the assets in those share classes and products for which we pay a related distribution and servicing fee these costs include those distribution and servicing costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries that source the assets of certain share classes of our us mutual funds and is offset entirely by the 12b1 revenue we earn and report in administrative distribution and servicing fees 

advertising and promotion  advertising and promotion costs were 996 million  for 2018  924 million  for 2017  and 802 million  for 2016  the increases for 2018  from 2017  and for 2017  from 2016  are primarily driven by higher promotion and media costs as we seek to broaden our distribution efforts globally the increase for 2018 was also impacted by the launch of a new media advertising campaign in 2018  

productrelated costs  productrelated costs consists of nonadvisory related costs that we incur to service certain t rowe price products productrelated costs  were 1571 million  for 2018  an increase  of 111 million  or 76  compared with 2017  the increase is primarily due to higher operating costs of our collective investment trusts as client transfers have increased the number of trusts and their average net assets over the last year also contributing to the increase were higher costs incurred to provide administrative services to the us mutual funds 

productrelated costs were 1460 million  for 2017  an increase  of 63 million  or 45  compared with 2016  the increase is primarily due to higher costs incurred to provide administrative services to the us mutual funds and recordkeeping services to defined contribution retirement plans 

technology occupancy and facility costs   technology occupancy and facility costs  consists of depreciation expense technology equipment and maintenance software and costs related to our facilities these costs were 3839 million  for 2018  3505 million  for 2017  and 3198 million  for 2016  the increases for 2018  from 2017  and for 2017  from 2016  are due primarily to incremental investment in our technology capabilities including related depreciation hosted solution licenses and maintenance programs as well as expanded office facilities and new locations 

general administrative and other costs  general administrative and other costs consist of costs associated with the overall management of the firm including information services professional services travel and entertainment research costs and other general operating expenses these costs were 2960 million  for 2018  2797 million  for 2017  and 2181 million  for 2016  the increases for 2018  from 2017  and for 2017  from 2016  were a result of our continued investment in our strategic initiatives and other growing operational and regulatory demands on the business specifically about twothirds of the increase for 2017 as compared with 2016 was attributable to increased professional fees incurred to support these continued investments in our operational and regulatory business demands the increased level of professional fees for 2017 did not recur for 2018

nonoperating income   

net nonoperating investment income decreased   3731 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  compared with 2017  and increased   1692 million  for the year ended december 31 2017  compared with 2016  net nonoperating investment activity for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  comprised the following 



during 2018  nonoperating income included the impact of sharp market declines in the later part of 2018 which resulted in unrealized losses on our investment portfolio including our consolidated products compared with unrealized gains recognized during 2017 partially offsetting these losses was the recognition during 2018 of a realized gain in other investment income associated with the sale of our 10 holding in daiwa sb investments ltd additionally on january 1 2018 we implemented new accounting guidance that eliminated the availableforsale investment category for equity securities as a result of this change realized gains of 308 million from the sale of certain availableforsale investments recognized in 2017  did not reoccur in 2018 

during 2017  nonoperating income included 308 million in gains realized from the disposition of certain availableforsale investments and 236 million in unrealized gains recognized on t rowe price trading investments that result from our decision to economically hedge the market exposure associated with our supplemental savings plan liability in order to fund the hedge portfolio we used the proceeds from the sale of certain availableforsale investments in certain us mutual funds as well as designated a mutual fund that was held as availableforsale the designation of the mutual fund as an economic hedge transferred its accounting classification from an availableforsale security to a trading security and resulted in the reclassification of the investments unrealized holding gain at the date of designation to the income statement from the balance sheet where it was previously recognized

the impact of consolidating certain t rowe price investment products on the individual lines of our consolidated statements of income for 2018  2017  and 2016  is as follows 



provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2018  was 258  compared with 369  for 2017  and 360 for the 2016  the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2018 from 2017 is primarily due to the reduction in the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 on january 1 2018 following the enactment on december 22 2017 of a comprehensive us tax reform bill known as the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform for 2018  and 2017  the income tax provision includes nonrecurring charges of 208 million  and 711 million  respectively related to the enactment of us tax reform as we adjusted our deferred tax asset and liability estimates the increase in tax rate in 2017 from 2016 was primarily due to the nonrecurring charges taken in 2017 

our tax rate in 2017 and 2016 was reduced by tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options vesting of restricted stock and net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests related to our consolidated t rowe price investment products as these earnings are not taxable to us 

on april 24 2018 the state of maryland enacted new state tax legislation this new state tax legislation effective in 2018  adopted a fiveyear phasein of the single sales factor method of apportionment for calculating income tax for multistate companies doing business in maryland and is expected to result in a net benefit over time accordingly we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 79 million  during 2018  for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of this maryland state tax legislation based on information currently available we expect that the maryland state tax legislation will reduce our effective state tax rate over the fiveyear phasein period to less than 25 

page  35 

    

the following table reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



1 state income tax benefits are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and stockbased compensation plans activity 

our effective tax rate will continue to experience volatility in future periods as the tax benefits recognized from stockbased compensation are impacted by market fluctuations in our stock price and timing of option exercises the rate will also be impacted by changes in our consolidated investment products that are driven by market fluctuations and changes in the proportion of their net income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests we currently estimate our effective tax rate for the fullyear 2019  will be in the range of 235  to 265  

nongaap information and reconciliation 

we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results these measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business for comparing current results with prior period results and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers however nongaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies beginning in 2018 our nongaap adjustments no longer include nonoperating income related to our cash and discretionary investments we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results 

page  36 

    

the following schedule reconciles us gaap financial measures to nongaap financial measures for each of the last five years 



page  37 

    

1 the nongaap adjustments add back the management fees that we earn from the consolidated t rowe price investment products  and subtract the investment income and operating expenses of these products  that have been included in our us gaap consolidated statements of income we believe the consolidated t rowe price investment products  may impact the readers ability to understand our core operating results the following table details the calculation of operating expenses of consolidated t rowe price investment products net of elimination of its related management and administrative fees 

the following table details the calculation of net income of consolidated t rowe price investment products  net of redeemable noncontrolling interests   



2 this nongaap adjustment removes the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability and related investments designated as economic hedges of the liability beginning july 1 2017 amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation depreciation of hypothetical investments chosen by the employees since we economically hedge the exposure to these market movements we believe it is useful to offset the nonoperating investment income earned on the hedges against the related compensation expense to increase comparability period to period the following table details the supplemental savings plan related items 



page  38 

    

3 this nongaap adjustment removes the nonoperating income that remains after backing out the portion related to the consolidated t rowe price investment products and the investments designated as an economic hedge of our supplemental savings plan liability beginning in the second quarter of 2018 we modified the nongaap adjustment to no longer adjust for the investment gains recognized on our cash and discretionary investments as the income earned on these assets are considered part of our core operations the impact on previously reported nongaap measures is immaterial we believe adjusting for the remaining nonoperating income helps the readers ability to understand our core operating results and increases comparability to prior years additionally we do not emphasize the impact of the portion of nonoperating income removed when managing and evaluating our performance 



4 in the second quarter of 2016 we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 1662 million related to our decision to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter we also recognized an offset to this charge during the fourth quarter of 2016 for related insurance recoveries totaling 100 million in the first quarter of 2017 we recognized additional insurance recoveries of 50 million as a reduction in operating expenses from claims that were filed in relation to the matter during 2018 we recognized an additional reduction in operating expenses of 152 million  upon recovering a portion of the payments we made to our clients in 2016 we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for these charges and nonrecurring recoveries in arriving at adjusted operating expenses and net income attributable to t rowe price group and diluted earnings per share 

5 the income tax impacts were calculated in order to achieve an overall yeartodate nongaap effective tax rate of 241  for 2018  347  for 2017  366  for 2016  389  for 2015  and 386  for 2014  we currently estimate our nongaap effective tax rate for the fullyear 2019  will be in the range of 24  to 26  

6 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 711 million to reflect the effect of the us tax law changes enacted on december 22 2017 during the second quarter of 2018 we also recognized a nonrecurring charge of 208 million for an adjustment made to the charge taken in 2017 related to the enactment of us tax reform we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for these nonrecurring charges in arriving at net income attributable to t rowe price group and diluted earnings per share 

7 during the second quarter of 2018 we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 79 million for the remeasurement of the firms deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effect of maryland state tax legislation enacted on april 24 2018 we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to t rowe price group and diluted earnings per share 

  

8  this nongaap measure was calculated by applying the twoclass method to adjusted net income attributable to t rowe price group divided by the weightedaverage common shares outstanding assuming dilution

during 2018  stockholders’ equity increase d from 58 billion  to 61 billion  tangible book value increased to 55 billion  at december 31 2018  

sources of liquidity 

we remain debtfree with ample liquidity including cash and investments in t rowe price products as follows 

during 2018  we rebalanced our cash and discretionary investments portfolio resulting in the reallocation of some cash invested in t rowe price money market funds to certain t rowe price investment products given the availability of our financial resources and cash expected to be generated through future operations we do not maintain an available external source of additional liquidity 

our seed capital investments are redeemable although we generally expect to be invested for several years until unrelated thirdparty investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage cash and discretionary investments in t rowe price products held by our subsidiaries outside the us were 4253 million  at december 31 2018  and 4245 million  at december 31 2017  

the cash and investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on how we account for the cash or investment the following table details how t rowe price group’s interests in cash and t rowe price investment products relate to where they are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2018  



our consolidated balance sheet reflects the cash and cash equivalents investments other assets and liabilities of those t rowe price investment products  we consolidate as well as redeemable noncontrolling interests for the portion of these t rowe price investment products  that are held by unrelated thirdparty investors although we can redeem our net interest in these t rowe price investment products  at any time we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the products  to obtain cash for general operations additionally the assets of these t rowe price investment products  are not available to our general creditors our interest in these t rowe price investment products  was used as initial seed capital and when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no

longer needed we will recategorize that investment in accordance with our cash and discretionary investment framework so as to not impact the investment product  and ultimately the unrelated thirdparty investors 

uses of liquidity 

we paid 280  per share in regular dividends in 2018  an increase of 228  over the 228  per share paid in 2017  additionally we expended 10996 million  in 2018 to repurchase 108 million  shares or 44  of our outstanding common stock at an average price of 10148  per share these dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations we will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans 

since the end of 2015  we have returned 40 billion  to stockholders through stock repurchases and our regular quarterly dividends as follows 



we anticipate property and equipment expenditures for the fullyear 2019  to be up to 200 million  of which about 65  is planned for technology initiatives we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating cash flows and other available resources 

the following tables summarize the cash flows for 2018  2017  and 2016  that are attributable to t rowe price group our consolidated t rowe price investment products  and the related eliminations required in preparing the statement

operating activities 

operating activities attributable to t rowe price group during 2018  provided cash flows of 22 billion  an increase  of 6263 million  from the 2017  period the increase in these operating cash flows was driven by 6416 million  of higher net income after adjusting for significant noncash activity including depreciation expense stockbased compensation expense and market gains on investments adjustments for market gains on investments decreased during 2018 in part due to a change in accounting guidance that we adopted on january 1 2018 see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for more information the remaining decrease in investment gain activity is due to lower gains as a result of a weaker equity market in 2018 compared with 2017 additionally during 2017 we invested 2186 million  into certain investment products to establish an economic hedge of our supplemental savings plan liability and invested an additional 1295 million  in 2018 in order to maintain it the remaining 1044 million  decrease in operating cash flows attributable to t rowe price group relates to timing differences on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities including the settlement of insurance receivables during 2017 related to the dell appraisal rights matter the remaining change in reported cash flows from operating activities was attributable to the net change in trading securities held in our consolidated investment products’ underlying portfolios 

operating activities attributable to t rowe price group during 2017 provided cash flows of 16 billion an increase of 2081 million from the 2016 period the increase was largely attributable to higher net income attributable to t rowe price group as well as the timing differences of cash flows related to the dell appraisal rights matter we paid 1662 million to certain t rowe price clients during 2016 and received insurance recoveries of 1500 million during 2017 relating to this matter these changes in cash flows were offset by cash outflows in the 2017 period for new investments made into t rowe price investment products held as trading totaling 2186 million in order to economically hedge our supplemental savings plan liability the net cash provided by operating activities attributable to t rowe price group was offset in part by the net change in trading securities held in t rowe price consolidated investment products’ underlying investment products 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to t rowe price group totaled 9457 million  in 2018  an increase of 9118 million  compared with 2017  during 2018  we rebalanced our cash and discretionary investments portfolio resulting in the reallocation of cash and cash equivalents of 10 billion  to certain t rowe price funds excluding these reallocations net purchases of other discretionary investment products decreased 653 million  during 2018 compared with 2017 these changes in investing cash flows during 2018 compared with 2017 were offset by a 431 million  decrease in in seed capital provided a 176 million  decrease in property and equipment expenditures and a 958 million  change in other investing activity primarily relating to the sale of our 10 interest in daiwa sb investments ltd during the third quarter since we consolidate the seed capital in t rowe price investment products our seed capital was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flows the remaining change in reported cash flows from investing activities was attributable to a 404 million  decrease in net cash removed from our balance sheet from consolidating and deconsolidating investment products during 2018  compared with the 2017  

net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to t rowe price group totaled 339 million in 2017 an increase of 1858 million from the comparable 2016 period during 2017 we received net proceeds of 2967 million upon the sale of certain t rowe price investment products an increase of 779 million compared with the 2016 period a portion of the net proceeds received in 2017 were used to fund the newly established economic hedge of our supplemental savings liability mentioned above this net increase in investing cash flows was offset by 378 million increase in property and equipment expenditures during 2017 compared with the 2016 period additionally the amount of seed capital investments we provided in 2017 decreased by 1474 million compared with the 2016 period since we consolidate these t rowe price investment products our investment was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flow the cash flow attributable to consolidated t rowe price investment products of 642 million in 2017 represented the aggregate net cash removed from our balance sheet upon consolidating and deconsolidating products during the 2016 period the comparable cash flow activity added 414 million to our balance sheet 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group were 17099 million  in 2018  compared with 8201 million  in 2017  the increase was primarily driven by spending 6323 million  more in common stock repurchases in 2018 as market volatility provided an opportunity to buy back more shares additionally a nearly 23  increase in our quarterly dividend per share resulted in paying 1312 million  more in dividends in 2018 the decline in our stock price in 2018 led to fewer stock options being exercised and a 1263 million  decrease in 

page  43 

    

related cash proceeds compared with the 2017  the remaining change in reported cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to a 8112 million  decrease in net subscriptions received from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders of our consolidated investment products during 2018  compared with the 2017  

net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group totaled 8201 million in 2017 compared with 10914 million in 2016 the decrease in cash used in financing activities was related in part to a reduction of 2188 million expended in common stock repurchases as the sharp increase in our stock price led us to repurchase fewer shares in 2017 this decrease in cash flows was offset by a 748 million increase in proceeds from option exercises as a greater number of options were exercised due to the sharp increase in our stock price in 2017 the remaining change in reported cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to a 3666 million increase in net subscriptions received from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders of our consolidated t rowe price investment products during 2017 compared with the 2016 period 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of our supplemental savings plan existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2018  the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2019  and future years the information also excludes the 161 million  of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 



1  these obligations represent the amount of future expected funding requirements related to our supplemental savings plan payment periods are based on deferral elections made by participants if no deferral election has been made the obligation has been included in the thereafter column as the timing of distributions will be determined upon termination of employment we economically hedge this liability and the related market exposure with investments in certain t rowe price products the carrying value of these investments at december 31 2018 was 3813 million  and are reported within the investments line on our consolidated balance sheet either available cash or these investments can be used to fund the future liability payments 

2  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations 

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 273 million  at december 31 2018  the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

page  44 

    

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2018  annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

consolidation   

we consolidate all subsidiaries and t rowe price investment products  in which we have a controlling interest we are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment our analysis to determine whether an entity is a vie or a voting interest entity voe involves judgment and considers several factors including an entity’s legal organization capital structure the rights of the equity investment holders our ownership interest in the entity and our contractual involvement with the entity we continually review and reconsider our vie or voe conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events such as changes to our ownership interest changes to an entity’s legal structure or amendments to governing documents our vies are primarily t rowe price investment products  and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities 

we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant our sicav funds and other t rowe price investment products  regulated outside the us are determined to be vies at december 31 2018  we consolidated vies with net assets of 14 billion  

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments   

we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti and certain investments in t rowe price investment products  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

goodwill   

we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million  as of december 31 2018  

provision for income taxes   

after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual 

page  45 

    

provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the us mutual funds  and other investment products  fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment products  and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment products  as compared with competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any otherthantemporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investees net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the us and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the us the pace and level of spending to support key strategic priorities variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses restricted stock units and other equity grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure the timing of the assumption of all third party research payments unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as fund and product  recordkeeping facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

equity price risk 

the following table presents the equity price risk from our investments in t rowe price investment products  as they are carried at fair value investments in these products  generally moderate market risk as they are diversified and invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price manages its cash and discretionary investments exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among equity and fixed income portfolios as well as many domestic and international product s in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate seed capital investments which are used for new product offerings experience market volatility as we do not actively manage the market risk for these investments 

in order to quantify the sensitivity of our investments to changes in market valuations we have chosen to use a variant of each product s net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each product s net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each of its investment objectives the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of these investments at december 31 2018  was determined by using the lower of each product ’s lowest net asset value per share during 2018  or its net asset value per share at december 31 2018  reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all product s experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  

any losses arising from the change in fair value of investments in t rowe price products would result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group the direct investment in consolidated t rowe price investment products  represents our portion of the net assets of the product  upon consolidation of these products  our direct investment is eliminated and the net assets of the products  are combined in our consolidated balance sheet together with redeemable noncontrolling interests which represents the portion of the products  that is owned by unrelated thirdparty investors any losses arising from the change in fair value of our direct investments in consolidated t rowe price investment products  would also result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group

currency translation risk 

certain of our investments including a few consolidated t rowe price investment products  expose us to currency translation risk when the financial statements are translated into us dollars usd our most significant exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of our equity method investment in uti  1524 million  at december 31 2018  utis financial statements are denominated in indian rupees inr and are translated to usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss  net of tax of 488 million  at december 31 2018  related to our investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several countries outside the us of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than usd associated with these operations although our revenues are predominately realized in usd we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

strategic initiatives 

our core capabilities have enabled us to deliver excellent operating results since our ipo in 1986 we maintain a clientcentric culture that is focused on delivering excellent longterm investment performance and worldclass service to our clients we have distributed our broad array of active investment strategies through a diverse set of distribution channels to meet the needs of our clients our ongoing financial strength has allowed us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service 

the market in which we operate has been evolving quickly and a number of headwinds have arisen over the last few years including a shifting demand from equities to incomeoriented solutions as the population ages demand for new vehicles to meet client needs an accelerating regulatory landscape and passive and alternative investments taking market share from active strategies 

despite the headwinds we believe there are significant opportunities that align to our core capabilities as such we are responding with several multiyear initiatives that are designed to strengthen our longterm competitive position and can be categorized into three areas broadening our product offerings and vehicles strengthening and deepening distribution across all channels and strengthening our technology platform and digital capabilities we have seen early encouraging signs of success in the execution of these strategic imperatives

distribution channels 

we distribute our products in countries located within three broad geographical regions north america europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac we accumulate our assets under management from a diversified client base across five primary distribution channels us financial intermediaries emea and apac financial intermediaries individual us investors on a direct basis us retirement plan sponsors for which we provide recordkeeping services and institutional investors globally investors domiciled outside the us represent nearly 6  of total assets under management at the end of 2017  we service clients in 47  countries around the world the following table outlines the types of products within each distribution channel through which our assets under management as of december 31 2017  are sourced

investment capabilities 

we manage a broad range of investment strategies in equity fixed income and asset allocation across sectors styles and regions our strategies are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of investors and are delivered across a range of vehicles for the price funds investors select the fund based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus and can exchange balances among the funds as permitted when economic and market conditions or their investment needs change the investment objectives and investment management approaches employed in our other investment products  are similar to those in the price funds we also offer specialized advisory services including management of stable value investment contracts modeled asset allocation solutions and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

page  4 

    

the following table sets forth our broad investment capabilities as of december 31 2017  



we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector 

our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the us and england with additional staff based in australia hong kong japan singapore and switzerland we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new strategies investment vehicles and other products  to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period 

we typically provide seed capital for new investment products  to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets the length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment product  as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the product  from unrelated investors we attempt to ensure that the new investment product  has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment product s net asset value or its investment performance record at december 31 2017  we had seed capital investments of 12 billion  in our products 

page  5 

    

conversely we may also close or limit new investments across all t rowe price investment products  in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors at present the following strategies are generally closed to new investors 



assets under management 

the following table shows our assets under management in billions by distribution channel vehicle account type and asset class 

page  6 

    

nonus dollar denominated securities held in client accounts are 1357 billion  or 137  of our total assets under management at december 31 2017  and 954 billion  or 118  at december 31 2016  

investment advisory fees 

we provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the price funds clients on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and other t rowe price products  including collective investment trusts target date retirement trusts funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

ten of our 178 price funds  growth stock  bluechip growth  midcap growth  capital appreciation  value  new horizons  new income  equity income  international stock  and emerging markets stock  accounted for approximately 36  of our investment advisory revenues in 2017  and approximately 29  of our assets under management at december 31 2017  our largest client account relationship apart from the price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 6  of our investment advisory revenues in 2017  

price funds 

at december 31 2017  assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 6063 billion  an increase of 179  or 921 billion  from the beginning of the year investment advisory services are provided to each us mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate for the majority of the price funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the price funds if the combined net assets of these price funds exceed 650 billion  the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 286 basis points  for the first 650 billion  of net assets plus 265 basis points  for net assets in excess of 650 billion  to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds including the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion the new income and value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 20 billion the capital appreciation fund has its base individual flat rate reduced by 10 on net assets in excess of 275 billion the effective fee rates for each of the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of approximately 60 million  or greater in 2017  varied from a low of 31  basis points for the limited duration inflation focused bond fund to a high of 104  basis points for the emerging markets stock and international discovery funds 

the fee rate of several of the price funds including the index and summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and as a result our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs each of the funds in the spectrum funds series and in the target date retirement funds series that we offer invests in a diversified portfolio of other price funds and has no separate investment advisory fee rather they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer and subtransfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

page  7 

    

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses such as those described above in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured 

during 2015 and 2016 we voluntarily waived 476 million and 105 million respectively in money market related fees including advisory fees and fund expenses in order to maintain a positive yield for investors in 2017 money market waivers were negligible 

other investment products  

our other investment products  had assets under management of 3848 billion  at december 31 2017  an increase of 882 billion  from the beginning of the year we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other t rowe price products that pay management fee on a daily basis normally provides for termination with thirty day notice our standard separately managed account agreements provide for termination at any time and the refunding of any unearned fees paid in advance our standard subadvised client account agreement typically provides for termination with sixty days notice 

our subsidiaries t rowe price luxembourg management sàrl and t rowe price international provide management company and investment management services respectively to our luxembourgbased sicavs and fcps and auts t rowe price luxembourg management sàrl and t rowe price international provide authorized corporate depositor and investment management services respectively to our ukbased oeics our subsidiaries t rowe price associates and trowe price hong kong may also provide subadvised investment management services to these global investment products  we distribute these products  outside the us through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries the fees we earn for distributing and marketing these products are part of our overall investment management fees for managing the product  assets we currently recognize any related distribution fees paid to these financial intermediaries in other operating expenses 

in addition to providing investment management services to the price funds our subsidiaries t rowe price associates and t rowe price international offer separately managed institutional investment management and subadvised investment management services to global intermediaries our subsidiary t rowe price trust company offers and provides investment management services to our t rowe price collective investment trusts which are used in the investment portfolios of certain qualified us retirement plans 

our fees for managing these other investment products  are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations end of billing period valuations or monthend average valuations in 2017  approximately 76  of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 15  were based on end of billing period valuations and 9  were based on monthend averages 

administrative services 

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting distribution and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in t rowe price us mutual funds  recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the t rowe price complex brokerage and trust services 

our subsidiaries provide administrative services to the price funds and their shareholders t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including the staff facilities technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders the price funds contract directly with bny mellon to provide mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share to the price funds 

t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the price funds the t rowe price collective investment trusts and funds outside the t rowe price complex t rowe price retirement plan services also provides transfer agent services to the price funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the price funds and outside fund families compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the respective funds as of december 31 2017  we provided recordkeeping services for 177 billion  in assets under administration of which 111 billion  are assets we manage 

page  8 

    

t rowe price trust company provides administrative trustee services through this entity which is a marylandchartered limited service trust company we serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products 

t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans 

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in staying on track to achieve their financial goals 

distribution and servicing 

the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the us on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and fixed income products  the i class of certain price funds is designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios this share class limits ordinary operating expenses other than interest expenses related to borrowings taxes and brokerage and any nonextraordinary expenses at 5 basis points for a period of time and there are no external payments for 12b1 or administrative fee payments 

certain of the price funds also offer advisor class and r class shares that are distributed to investors and defined contribution retirement plans respectively these share classes pay 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services trpis is the principal distributor of the price funds and hires thirdparty financial intermediaries to distribute these share classes trpis enters into agreements with each intermediary under which each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries in addition those price funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statements of income we also recognize as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statements of income the corresponding cost paid to the thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these funds share classes the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media television and internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including the enhancement of our digital capabilities

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies hedge funds and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products  offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services 

in recent years we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies as a result such products have taken market share from active managers while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain we believe there will always be demand for good active management 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship 

employees 

at december 31 2017  we employed 6881  associates up 87  from the 6329  associates employed at the end of 2016  we may add additional temporary and parttime personnel to our staff from time to time to meet periodic and special project demands primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative services

risk factors 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price us mutual funds  and other investment products  our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity products  there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased products  at the low end and emerging markets products  at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income products  though not as widely as equity products  with stable value products  and money market products  at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bond products  at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 



page  11 

    

 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

the performance of our money market   products   are impacted by the interest rate environment   

our money market products  performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the product  when interest rates are very low the operating costs of the product s will become a greater portion of its net income thereby reducing the yield to very low levels the interest rate environment experienced from the second half of 2009 through 2016 led us to voluntarily waive our advisory and other fees earned on our money market product s in order to maintain yields at or above 0 for fund investors the actual amount of fees we waived was dependent on a number of variables including among others changes in the net assets held by our money market product s changes in market yields changes in the expense levels of the product s and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers these waivers reduced our advisory fee income and net income if a similar interest rate environment was to reocur there is no guarantee that we would voluntarily waive fees again for further discussion of the fees we waived in 2016 and the net cash flows of our money market product s please see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry competitive pressures may result in a loss of customers and their assets or compel us to reduce the fees we charge to clients thereby reducing our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some competitors operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products  offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them most of our investment products  are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing products  

the market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive products as a result investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain we believe there will always be demand for good active management 

page  12 

    

if current or potential customers decide to move their assets to one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income in the event that we decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures which we have done selectively in the past revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our usbased associates do not have employments contracts while our associates outside the us have employment contracts where basic employment terms are confirmed in writing generally our associates can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel due to the global nature of our investment advisory business our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions we have near and longterm succession planning processes including programs to develop our future leaders which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent however in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational processes could have an adverse effect on our reputation and decrease our revenues 

we provide investment management product  administration product  recordkeeping and tax reporting services to our clients in certain cases we rely on thirdparty vendors in the execution and delivery of these services there can be no assurance that these vendors will properly perform these processes or that there will not be interruptions in services from these third parties 

failure to properly execute or oversee these services could subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties or litigation in some cases we employ quantitative models to support investment decisions and processes including those related to risk assessment portfolio management and activities undetected errors in the design function or underlying assumptions used in these could lead to an adverse impact to t rowe price’s business and reputation 

new investment products  we introduce could increase the risk that our existing systems may not be adequate to control the risks introduced by such new investment products  in addition our information systems and technology platforms might not be able to accommodate our continued growth and the cost of maintaining such systems might increase from its current level materialization of these risks could disrupt our operations or result in financial exposure regulatory inquiry or reputational damage 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client service our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed additionally we are subject to the risk that our employees or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures real or perceived conflicts between our clients’ interests and our own as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information may impair our reputation and subject us to litigation or regulatory action any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 



page  13 

    

 

under our agreements with the price funds we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any t rowe price investment products  any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

amendments to tax laws may impact the marketability of the products and services we offer our clients or the financial position of the company   

we are subject to income taxes as well as nonincome based taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions we cannot predict future changes in the tax regulations to which we are subject and they could have a material impact on our liability or result in increased costs of our tax compliance efforts additionally changes in the status of tax deferred investment options including retirement plans taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates could cause investors to view certain investment products  less favorably and reduce investor demand for products  and services we offer which could have an adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues 

on december 22 2017 a comprehensive us tax reform bill originally known as the “tax cuts and jobs act” “tax reform” was enacted into law we are required to recognize the effect of tax reform in our 2017 financial statements even though the effective date of the law for most provisions is january 1 2018 we continue to evaluate the impact of tax reform and expect new regulations to be issued to address certain uncertainties in the application of the law this might result in changes to our estimates and expectations given our inability to predict the impact of future regulations and other guidance 

examinations and audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods 

based on the global nature of our business from time to time we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes and in certain cases interest fines or penalties we have a process to evaluate whether to record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional income taxes will be due we adjust these liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties however the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our estimates 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment products  in the us and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment products  and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our products  it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and 

page  14 

    

other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment product  these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment product  as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment products  will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflicts terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region and in london england we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur we also rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for service delivery in addition to technology and disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial investment portfolio all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments in the case of our availableforsale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to t rowe price products  that are consolidated held as trading or accounted for under the equity method in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position 

any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping additional or new regulatory requirements operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us and have an equity investment in uti our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations new regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

 

 

 



page  16 

    

 

 

 

 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

in 2016 we paid 1662 million  to compensate certain t rowe price mutual funds trusts separately managed accounts and subadvised clients collectively “clients” for the denial of their appraisal rights by the delaware chancery court court in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of dell inc dell the court ruled on may 11 2016 that the clients could not pursue an appraisal of any shares they held that were voted in favor of the dell merger the appraisal statute governing the transaction required the record holder to vote against or abstain from voting on the transaction in order to assert appraisal rights after previously voting against prior transaction proposals the voting instructions submitted on behalf of the clients in connection with voting on the final proposed transaction were incorrectly submitted in favor of the transaction on may 31 2016 the court determined that the fair value of dell at the time of the merger was 1762 per share as opposed to the 1375 price offered in the transaction as a result any shareholder perfecting appraisal rights is entitled to a payment at 1762 per share plus statutory interest from the date the dell transaction closed subject to possible appeal of the courts decision the 

page  17 

    

compensation to clients was intended to make them whole for the voting discrepancy that resulted in the denial of their appraisal rights we recovered insurance proceeds totaling 1500 million related to this matter 

in accordance with the compensation payment the clients agreed that in the event the findings made by the court regarding the fair value of dell or the amount of interest to be applied were modified by a final nonappealable judgment t rowe price and the clients would make an appropriate adjustment between themselves calculated in a manner that is consistent with the methodology used to compensate clients in december 2016 several parties including dell and the successful appraisal petitioners filed appeals to the delaware supreme court to challenge the court’s valuation ruling 

on december 14 2017 the delaware supreme court reversed the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings it is not clear how the court will eventually rule and what the ultimate valuation will be although the supreme court’s opinion suggests that the deal price of 1375 may be the ultimate outcome once the court enters a final nonappealable judgment clients will be required to repay any overpayment using the methodology used to calculate the original payment we estimate that the first 152 million reclaimed would be paid back to t rowe price group we would then be required to repay any additional reclaimed funds to our insurers 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

united kingdom exit from european union 

we have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the united kingdom “uk” to support our global investment management business the ultimate impact of the uk exit “brexit” from the european union “eu” on our business operations in the uk and europe could vary depending on the details of the separation agreement we are preparing for multiple scenarios and remain committed to our clients associates and business expansion across the region 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary or thirdparty licensed technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

all of our technology systems including those provided by vendors are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks such as hacking or viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage and other causes a suspension or termination of vendorprovided software licenses or related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion 

page  18 

    

we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or detected in a timely manner we also leverage cloudbased solutions for the transmission and storage of this information our systems or those of thirdparty service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code additionally authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in t rowe price us mutual funds  and other investment products  the other investment products  include separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other t rowe price products  including collective investment trusts target date retirement trusts openended investment products offered to investors outside the us and products  offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment products  which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations we incur significant expenditures to develop new products and services and improve and expand our capabilities and distribution channels in order to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management 

the general trend to passive investing has been persistent and accelerated in recent years which has impacted our new client inflows however over the long term we expect wellexecuted active management to play an important role for investors in this regard we remain debtfree with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities we are investing in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly providing our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future 

in 2018 we expect to advance our strategic priorities to sustain and deepen our investment talent add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally we currently expect 2018 nongaap operating expense growth to lessen relative to 2017 even as growth in market driven expenses and investments in the business continue however  we could elect to adjust our expense growth should markets increase or decline significantly in addition other events not currently planned or expected could impact  our expense level in 2018  we are carefully evaluating the impact the us tax reform will have  and factoring in the potential investment operating expense and capital management implications   

background 

lifted by favorable corporate earnings and economic growth us stocks posted excellent returns in 2017 in fact it was the ninth consecutive year of positive total returns for the sp 500 index equities were also buoyed at times by hopes that president trump’s proposals for lower tax rates reduced regulation and increased infrastructure spending would be enacted the federal reserve raised shortterm interest rates three times in 2017 but the central bank’s moves were widely expected and did not disrupt the equity markets in the closing weeks of the year congress passed and president trump signed legislation that reduces tax rates for corporations and closely held businesses and reduces marginal tax rates for individuals at most income levels most major stock indexes finished the year near record levels amid expectations that the new tax law would lift corporate profits and add to us economic growth in 2018 

developed nonus equity markets outperformed the broad us market as a weaker dollar enhanced returns to us investors as measured by the msci japan index  japanese stocks rose more than 24 aided by an economic recovery and by the reelection of the reformminded prime minister european equity markets also generated strong returns lifted in part by an economic recovery and continued european central bank stimulus shares in the uk rose but lagged other markets as brexitrelated uncertainty lingered for most of the year growth remained sluggish and elevated inflation prompted the bank of england to raise shortterm interest rates in november 

emerging equity markets significantly outperformed developed markets most major regions featured several countries with very strong returns in dollar terms 

page  24 

    

results of several major equity market indexes for 2017  are as follows 



global bond returns were mostly positive in 2017 in the us shorterterm treasury yields increased while the 10year treasury note yield which dipped as low as about 20 in early september decreased from about 25 to 24 for the year in the investmentgrade universe corporate bonds performed well as credit spreads tightened during the year longterm treasuries produced gains but shorterterm treasuries struggled municipal bonds outperformed taxable bonds high yield bonds outperformed highquality issues helped by their lower interest rate sensitivity and investors’ demand for securities with attractive yields 

bonds in developed nonus markets performed well in us dollar terms in 2017 as the weaker dollar lifted returns to us investors in the uk the 10year government bond yield was little changed for the year late in the year rising inflation prompted the central bank to raise shortterm interest rates in the eurozone bond yields generally rose as the economic recovery gained traction late in the year the european central bank announced that it will continue its bondbuying program until september 2018 but that it will halve the size of its monthly purchases starting in january in japan the central bank sought to keep the 10year government bond yield around 0 bonds in developing markets produced good returns in dollar terms as growth in the emerging markets universe generally improved local currency bonds outperformed dollardenominated issues thanks to strength in many emerging markets currencies versus the us dollar 

results of several major bond market indexes for 2017  are as follows 



assets under management 

our assets under management ended 2017  at 9911 billion  an increase  of 1803 billion  from the end of 2016  during 2017  investors entrusted net inflows of 140 billion  to our management and market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 1663 billion  investment advisory clients outside the us account for about 6  of our assets under management at december 31 2017  up from about 5 at december 31 2016 





our target date retirement products  which are included in the asset totals shown above continue to be a significant part of our assets under management these product s invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other t rowe price funds or t rowe price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings assets in 

page  25 

    

these products at december 31 2017  totaled 2321 billion  including 1684 billion  in target date retirement funds and 637 billion  in target date retirement trusts 

the following table presents the component changes in assets under management for 2015  2016  and 2017  



in all three years the majority of the client transfers were from the t rowe price us mutual funds to the t rowe price collective investment trusts which are included in other investment products 

the cash flows include in addition to net client flows rebalancing within our proprietary target date mutual fund and trust products in order to maintain their targeted asset allocation net cash flows after client transfers shown above include 162 billion  in 2015  81 billion  in 2016  and 71 billion  in 2017  from target date products  

net cash inflows into t rowe price us mutual funds  before transfers over the last three years were sourced primarily from thirdparty financial intermediaries across various mandates in each of the last three years the net inflows in our other investment products  resulted primarily from the client transfers received from the mutual funds in 2015 the net outflows prior to the client transfers into these portfolios were largely concentrated among a small number of institutional clients who redeemed primarily from largecap us equity strategies in 2016 other investment products net cash outflows prior to client transfers were largely attributable to institutional and intermediary clients reallocating to passive investments and the impact of our closed investment strategies in 2017 other investment products  net inflows prior to client transfers resulted primarily from flows into our subadvised accounts and luxembourg domiciled investment products 

page  26 

    

net cash flows after client transfers by investment product  and by asset class over the last three years are as follows 



investment performance 

strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting and retaining assets—and to our longterm success the percentage of our price funds across their share classes that outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis and percentage in top lipper quartile for the one three five and 10years ended december 31 2017  were 

in addition 88  of the t rowe price us mutual funds  assets under management ended december 31 2017  with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks remains very competitive especially over longer time periods

results of operations 

the table below presents financial results on a us gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis that adjusts for the impact of the dell appraisal rights matter the consolidated t rowe price investment products the supplemental savings plan other nonoperating income and the nonrecurring charge recognized in 2017 related to the enactment of us tax reform we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results   



1 see the reconciliation to the comparable us gaap measures at the end of the results of operations sections of this managements discussion and analysis 

investment advisory revenues earned in 2017  increased 150  over the comparable 2016  period as average assets under our management increase d 1308 billion  or 168  to 9090 billion  the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 472 basis points  in 2017  compared with 479 basis points  earned in the 2016  period our effective fee rate has declined primarily due to fee rate reductions we made to certain t rowe price investment products  since the end of 2015 and higher equity valuations in funds with tiered individual rates which decrease as assets under management grow the impact of the fee reductions was offset in part by higher equity valuations which resulted in a greater percentage of our assets under management being attributable to higher fee equity products  in addition there were negligible money market fee waivers in 2017 versus waivers in 2016  of 105 million  

our operating expenses in 2016  include a nonrecurring operating charge net of insurance recovery of 662 million or 15 per share after tax related to the dell appraisal rights matter during 2017 we recognized additional insurance recoveries totaling 50 million or 12  per share after tax from claims filed in 2016  related to this matter a summary of the financial impact of the dell matter on our annual pretax operating expenses and pretax operating cash flows since the matter arose is as follows 



on a nongaap basis our operating expenses increased 2990 million  or 124  over the comparable 2016 period about onefourth of the increase is related to certain expenses such as variable compensation and marketdriven distribution and 

page  28 

    

client servicing costs that are higher in 2017  as a result of the strong market performance the remaining change is attributable to our investments in the strategic initiatives announced in early 2017  and other growing operational and regulatory demands 

our operating margin in 2017  was 440  compared to 410  in the 2016  period excluding the impact of the dell appraisal rights matter our operating margin in 2017  and 2016  would have been 430 and 426 respectively the increase in our operating margin is driven by the higher percentage growth in net revenue from strong market performance compared with the growth in operating expenses 

net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price us mutual funds  increased 135  or 3665 million  to 31 billion  average mutual fund assets in 2017  were 5685 billion  an increase  of 147  from the average for the comparable 2016  period fee rate reductions of certain mutual funds were a factor in why advisory revenue grew slower than average assets under management during 2017  

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment products  for 2017  were 12158 million  an increase  of 1925 million  or 188  from the 10233 million  earned in 2016  average assets in these products  were 3405 billion  during 2017  up   204  from the comparable 2016  period 

we have reduced the management fees of certain mutual funds and other investment products since the end of 2015 these reductions were a factor in why investment advisory revenue grew slower than average assets under management during 2017 we regularly assess the competitiveness of our fees and will continue to make adjustments as deemed appropriate 

administrative fee revenues increase d 58 million  to 3583 million  in 2017  the increase is primarily attributable to transfer agent and other administrative servicing activities provided to the t rowe price us mutual funds  and their investors changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

in 2017  and 2016  our advisory and administrative fees are presented net of 56 million  and 65 million  respectively related to the elimination of management fee and administrative fees earned from our consolidated t rowe price investment products  

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor r and variable annuity ii class shares of certain t rowe price investment products  were 1470 million  in 2017  an increase  of 53 million  from the comparable 2016  period on higher average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs were 16649 million  in 2017  an increase  of 1709 million  or 114  compared to the 2016  period the largest part of the change is attributable to a 1169 million  increase in salaries and related benefit expenses which resulted primarily from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2017  combined with a 64  increase in average headcount from 2016  the higher employee benefit costs also includes greater payroll taxes associated with option exercises and restricted stock vesting that results from the significant rise in our stock price in 2017  as well as increased health care costs higher average headcount also drove recruiting costs to be up in 2017  compared with the 2016  period our annual variable compensation in the 2017  period rose 598 million  over the 2016  period stronger markets in 2017 increased the supplemental savings plan liability resulting in additional compensation expense of  211 million  in 2017  compared with the 2016  period the changes in these compensation and related costs were offset in part by higher labor capitalization related to internally developed software in 2017  compared with the 2016  period as we continue to invest in our technology capabilities we had a reduction in our noncash stock based compensation expense in 2017 as we shifted our annual grant from twice a year to a single grant in december 

advertising and promotion costs were 920 million  in 2017  an increase of 121 million  or 151  compared to 2016  we increased our spend in 2017  in support of efforts to broaden our distribution reach and in response to investor sentiment and the strong market environment 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased   323 million  or 105  compared to 2016  the increase is due primarily to added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities including related maintenance programs as well as expanded office facilities and new locations 

page  29 

    

other operating expenses were 4918 million  in 2017  an increase  of 903 million  from 2016  about half of this increase is attributable to professional fees incurred to support our continued investment in our operating capabilities and growth in regulatory demands the remainder of the change from 2016  results from higher distribution and client servicing costs that were driven by the strong market performance in 2017 as well as increased operational and regulatory business demands 

nonoperating income 

net nonoperating investment activity during 2017  resulted in income of 3963 million  compared with 2271 million  in 2016  the following table details the components of nonoperating income in millions during 2016  and 2017  



during 2017  nonoperating income includes 308 million in gains realized from the disposition of certain availableforsale investments and 236 million in unrealized gains recognized on t rowe price trading investments that result from our decision to economically hedge the market exposure associated with our supplemental savings plan liability in order to fund the hedge portfolio we used the proceeds from the sale of certain availableforsale investments in certain t rowe price us mutual funds  as well as designated a mutual fund that was held as availableforsale the designation of the t rowe price mutual fund as an economic hedge transferred its accounting classification from an availableforsale security to a trading security and resulted in the reclassification of the investments unrealized holding gain at the date of designation to the income statement from the balance sheet where it was previously recognized 

the impact of consolidating certain t rowe price investment products  on the individual lines of our consolidated statements of income for 2016 and 2017  is as follows

provision for income taxes 

our 2017 income tax provision includes a nonrecurring charge of 711 million  to reflect the estimated effect of the us tax law changes enacted on december 22 2017 in a comprehensive us tax reform bill originally known as the tax cuts and jobs act tax reform the recognized charge is based on current interpretation of the tax law changes and includes 189 million  for the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and a 522 million  tax liability for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings the increase in our 2017 effective tax rate resulting from this charge was offset in part by higher than expected tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options vesting of restricted stock and net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests related to our consolidated t rowe price investment products  as these earnings are not taxable to us the following reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective tax rate for 2017  



1 state income benefits totaling 4  are reflected in the total benefits for net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests and stockbased compensation plans activity 

we currently estimate that the reduction in the us corporate tax rate  from 35 to 21  in 2018 combined with other miscellaneous tax changes that effect certain tax deductions will reduce our 2018 effective tax rate to a range of 240  to 270  our effective tax rate will continue to experience volatility in future periods as the tax benefits recognized from stock based compensation are impacted by market fluctuations in our stock price and timing of option exercises the rate will also be impacted by changes in our consolidated investment products that are driven by market fluctuations and changes in the proportion of their net income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests 

we continue to evaluate the impact of the tax reform on our estimates and expectations due to changes in our interpretations of the law assumptions used in applying the law and additional guidance concerning the law that may be issued

2016 versus 2015 

the table below presents financial results on a us gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis to adjust for the nonrecurring charge related to the dell appraisal rights matter the impact of the consolidated t rowe price investment products  and other nonoperating income we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results 



1 nonoperating income varies from year to year due to a number of factors accordingly the percentage change in nonoperating income is not believed to be meaningful 

2 see the reconciliation to the comparable us gaap measures at the end of the results of operations sections of this managements discussion and analysis 

as detailed in the table above the percentage increase in investment advisory revenues in 2016  was in line with the increase in our average assets under management we waived 105 million  in money marketrelated fees including advisory fees and fund expenses in 2016 a decrease of 371 million  from the 476 million  waived in the 2015  period the fee waivers in 2016 represent less than 5 of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period these fees were waived from certain of our money market mutual funds and trusts which had combined net assets of 157 billion at december 31 2016  the annual fee rate earned on our assets under management was 479 basis points  in 2016 virtually unchanged from the 480 basis points  earned in 2015 the impact on our effective fee rate from the reduction in money market waivers in 2016 was offset by effective fee rate reductions in certain of t rowe price us mutual funds  

our 2016 operating expenses include a nonrecurring charge net of insurance recovery of 662 million or 15  per share after tax related to the dell appraisal rights matter in 2016 we paid our clients 1662 million to compensate them for the denial of their appraisal rights in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of dell we made claims to our insurance carriers and on december 30 2016   entered into an agreement with our primary insurance carrier to recover 100 million from the claim the insurance proceeds were recognized as an offset to the related 1662 million charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016 remaining insurance claims pending as of december 31 2016 resulted in an additional recovery of 50 million in the first quarter of 2017 

our operating margin in 2016  was 410  compared to 452  in the 2015 period without the impact of the nonrecurring charge relating to the dell appraisal rights matter our operating margin in 2016 would have been 426 the additional decline in our 2016 operating margin resulted primarily from the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management distribution and service capabilities around the world 

page  32 

    

our 2016  results were significantly impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related to consolidation and stockbased compensation the impact in millions the consolidated t rowe price investment products  had on the individual lines of our 2016 consolidated statement of income was as follows 



net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from t rowe price us mutual funds  increased 14  or 375 million  to 27 billion  average mutual fund assets in 2016  were 4955 billion  an increase  of 4  from the average for the comparable 2015  period the increase in advisory revenues was due in part to the reduction in money market fee waivers realized in 2016  compared with 2015  

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment products  for 2016  were 10233 million  an increase  of 39 million  or 4  from the 10194 million  earned in 2015  average assets in these products  were 2827 billion  during 2016  up   31  from the comparable 2015  period in 2016 our advisory revenues are presented net of 70 million  related to the elimination of management fees earned on the net assets of certain of our consolidated t rowe price investment products  we eliminated these advisory fees in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

administrative fee revenues decrease d 93 million  to 3525 million  in 2016  the decrease was primarily attributable to transfer agent servicing activities provided to the mutual funds and their investors as well as the shift of fund accounting and portfolio recordkeeping operations to bny mellon that prior to august 2015 we provided to the t rowe price us mutual funds  changes in administrative fee revenues were generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that were incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor r and variable annuity ii class shares of the t rowe price us mutual funds  were 1417 million  in 2016  a decrease  of 98 million  from the comparable 2015  period on lower average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third party intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs were 14940 million  in 2016  an increase  of 504 million  or 35  compared to the 2015  period the largest part of the increase  was attributable to a 567 million   increase  in salaries and related benefits which resulted from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2016  combined with a 32  increase in average headcount from 2015  noncash stockbased compensation expense and annual variable compensation were up 126 million  and 49 million  respectively these increases were offset by a higher level of technology labor capitalized in 2016 compared with 2015 and a reduction in temporary labor cost as the 2016 projects used more professional service resources the overall increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size from 2015  were muted by lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates in august 2015 to bny mellon and for the ongoing transition support we provide to them however these lower compensation costs were generally offset by increases in costs paid to bny mellon to provide these administrative services and other transitionrelated activities which are reflected in other operating expenses 

advertising and promotion costs were 799 million  in 2016  compared with 797 million  in 2015  

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased   207 million  or 73  compared to 2015  the increase was primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities including related maintenance programs 

page  33 

    

other operating expenses were 4015 million  in 2016  an increase  of 601 million  from 2015  about half of this increase was attributable to costs paid to bny mellon since august 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services as mentioned above the increase also included 65 million  in operating expenses net of investment advisory fees earned by us of those t rowe price investment products  that we began consolidating at the beginning of 2016 the remaining balance of the change was due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities 

nonoperating income 

net nonoperating investment activity during 2016  resulted in income of 2271 million  compared with 1035 million  in 2015  the following table details the components of nonoperating income in millions during 2015  and 2016  



the increase in investment gains on t rowe price products that are accounted for as an equity method or trading investments was driven by an increase in the number of equity method investments as well as market gains the investment income on consolidated t rowe price investment products  increased in 2016  as the number of products  we consolidated increased significantly upon the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2016 was 360  compared to 389  in 2015 the decrease in the effective tax rate was related in part to the increase in net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest related to our consolidated t rowe price investment products  as we do not recognize taxes associated with these earnings additionally the estimated effective tax rate declined as a result of adopting the new stockbased compensation accounting guidance under the new guidance tax benefits and shortfalls on exercised options and vested restricted stock relative to the stockbased compensation expense recognized are included in the provision for income taxes rather than as additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet our effective income tax rate also reflected the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates 

page  34 

    

nongaap information and reconciliation 

we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results these measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business for comparing current results with prior period results and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers however nongaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies the following schedule reconciles in millions except for pershare amounts us gaap financial measures to nongaap measures for each of the last five years 



page  35 

    

1 the nongaap adjustments add back the management fees that we earn from the consolidated t rowe price investment products  and subtract the investment income and operating expenses of these products  that have been included in our us gaap consolidated statements of income we believe the consolidated t rowe price investment products  may impact the readers ability to understand our core operating results the following table details the calculation of net income of consolidated t rowe price investment products  net of redeemable noncontrolling interests   



2 this nongaap adjustment removes the impact of market movements on the supplemental savings plan liability and related investments designated as economic hedges of the liability beginning july 1 2017 amounts deferred under the supplemental savings plan are adjusted for appreciation depreciation of hypothetical investments chosen by the employees since we economically hedge the exposure to these market movements we believe it is useful to offset the nonoperating investment income earned on the hedges against the related compensation expense to increase comparability period to period the following table details the supplemental savings plan related items 



3 this nongaap adjustment removes the nonoperating income that remains after eliminating the portion related to the consolidated t rowe price investment products  and investments designated as an economic hedge of our supplemental savings plan liability we believe excluding nonoperating income helps the readers ability to understand our core operating results and increases comparability to prior years additionally we do not emphasize the impact of nonoperating income when managing our firm and evaluating our performance the following table details the calculation of other nonoperating income 



4 in the second quarter of 2016 we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 1662 million related to our decision to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter we also recognized an offset to this charge during the fourth quarter of 2016 for related insurance recoveries totaling 100 million in the first quarter of 2017 we recognized additional insurance recoveries of 50 million as a reduction in operating expenses from claims that were filed in relation to the matter we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust for these charges and nonrecurring insurance recoveries in arriving at adjusted operating expenses and net income attributable to t rowe price group and diluted earnings per share 

5 these were calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to each nongaap adjustment before tax reform 

6 in the fourth quarter of 2017 we recognized a nonrecurring charge of 711 million  to reflect the effect of the us tax law changes enacted on december 22 2017 we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statements of income to adjust 

page  36 

    

for this nonrecurring charge in arriving at net income attributable to t rowe price group and diluted earnings per share 

  

7  this nongaap measure was calculated by applying the twoclass method to adjusted net income attributable to t rowe price group divided by the weightedaverage common shares outstanding assuming dilution 

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2017  stockholders’ equity increase d from 50 billion  to 58 billion  tangible book value increased to 52 billion  at december 31 2017  we paid 228  per share in regular dividends in 2017  an increase of 56  over the 216  per share paid in 2016  additionally we expended 4581 million  to repurchase 66 million  shares or 27  of our outstanding common stock in 2017  these dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations we will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans 

as detailed below we have returned 43 billion  to stockholders over the last three years through stock repurchases our regular quarterly dividends and a special dividend in 2015 



we remain debtfree with ample liquidity including cash and investments in t rowe price products as follows 



our seed capital investments are redeemable although we generally expect to be invested for several years until unrelated thirdparty investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage cash and discretionary investments in t rowe price products held by our subsidiaries outside the us were 3659 million  at december 31 2016  and 4245 million  at december 31 2017  

the following table details the line items of the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017  where our cash and investments are presented the investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on the type of investment as well as how we account for the investment 



page  37 

    

our consolidated balance sheet reflects the cash and cash equivalents investments other assets and liabilities of those t rowe price investment products  we consolidate as well as redeemable noncontrolling interests for the portion of these t rowe price investment products  that are held by unrelated thirdparty investors although we can redeem our net interest in these t rowe price investment products  at any time we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the portfolios to obtain cash for general operations additionally the assets of these t rowe price investment products  are not available to our general creditors our interest in these t rowe price investment products  was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed we assess the discretionary investment portfolio and when we liquidate our interest we attempt to do so in a way as to not impact the portfolio and ultimately the unrelated thirdparty investors 

we anticipate property and equipment expenditures in 2018  to be up to 180 million  of which about twothirds is planned for technology initiatives given the availability of our financial resources we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating resources

the following table summarizes the cash flows in millions for 2016  and 2017  that are attributable to t rowe price group our consolidated t rowe price investment products  and the related eliminations required in preparing the statement 



page  39 

    

2017  versus 2016  

operating activities attributable to t rowe price group during 2017  provided cash flows of 15518 million  an increase  of 2081 million  from the 2016  period the increase is largely attributable to higher net income attributable to t rowe price group as well as the timing differences of cash flows related to the dell appraisal rights matter we paid 1662 million to certain t rowe price clients during 2016 and received related insurance recoveries of 1500 million during 2017 relating to this matter these changes in cash flows were offset by cash outflows in the 2017 period for new investments made into t rowe price investment products  held as trading totaling 2186 million  in order to economically hedge our supplemental savings plan liability the net cash provided by operating activities attributable to t rowe price group was offset in part by the net change in trading securities held in t rowe price consolidated investment products ’ underlying investment products  

net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to t rowe price group totaled 339 million  in 2017  an increase  of 1858 million  from the comparable 2016 period during 2017  we realized  1842 million  more net proceeds from the purchases and sales of our availableforsale investments compared with 2016  this net increase in investing cash flows was offset by an 835 million decrease in proceeds from the sales of equity method investments and a 378 million increase in property and equipment expenditures during 2017  compared with the 2016  period additionally the amount of seed capital investments we provided in 2017  decreased by 1474 million  compared with the 2016  period since we consolidate these t rowe price investment products  our investment was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flow the cash flow attributable to consolidated t rowe price investment products  of 642 million  represents the aggregate net cash removed during 2017 from our balance sheet upon consolidating and deconsolidating products  during the 2016  period the comparable cash flow activity added 414 million  to our balance sheet 

net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group totaled 8201 million  in 2017  compared with 10914 million  in 2016  the decrease in cash used in financing activities is related in part to a reduction of 2188 million  expended in common stock repurchases as the sharp increase in our stock price led us to repurchase fewer shares in 2017  this decrease in cash flows was offset by a 748 million  increase in proceeds from option exercises as a greater number of options were exercised due to the sharp increase in our stock price in 2017  the remaining change in reported cash flows from financing activities is primarily attributable to a 3666 million   increase in net subscriptions received from redeemable noncontrolling interest holders of our consolidated t rowe price investment products  during 2017  compared to the 2016  period 

  

2016  versus 2015  

operating activities attributable to t rowe price group during 2016 provided cash flows of 13437 million a decrease of 1868 million from the 2015 period the decline was primarily related to the payments totaling 1662 million we made in 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter we entered into an agreement on december 30 2016 for a 100 million insurance recovery that we received in january 2017 the net cash provided by operating activities attributable to t rowe price group was offset in part by the net change in trading securities held in t rowe price consolidated investment products ’ underlying investment products  

net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to t rowe price group totaled 2197 million in 2016 in 2016 we provided 2845 million in seed capital to new and existing t rowe price investment products  we utilized a portion of the 2195 million in proceeds from the sale of certain availableforsale investments and equity method investments in 2016 to fund these seed capital investments since we consolidate these t rowe price investment products  the seed capital that we provided was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flow in 2015 cash proceeds from the sale of certain t rowe price us mutual funds  holdings net of new investments resulted in investing cash flows of 2697 million additionally our net property and equipment additions were 1483 million in 2016 compared to 1513 million in the 2015 period the cash flow attributable to consolidated t rowe price investment products  of 414 million represents the net cash added to our consolidated balance sheet from consolidating and deconsolidating products  in 2016 

net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group was 10914 million in 2016 compared with 19733 million in the 2015 period the decline in cash used in financing activities is largely related to the 200 per share or 524 million special dividend we paid in april 2015 we also expended 3109 million less in common stock purchases in 2016 compared to the 2015 period the cash proceeds received from stock option exercises were higher in 2016 by 528 million compared with the 2015 period the net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group was largely offset by the 9150 million of net subscriptions into the consolidated t rowe price investment products

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2017  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2018  and future years the information also excludes the 76 million  of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 



we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 388 million  at december 31 2017  the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2017  annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

consolidation  we consolidate all subsidiaries and t rowe price investment products  in which we have a controlling interest we are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment our analysis to determine whether an entity is a vie or a voting interest entity voe involves judgment and considers several factors including an entity’s legal organization capital structure the rights of the equity investment holders our ownership interest in the entity and our contractual involvement with the entity we continually review and reconsider our vie or voe conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events such as changes to our ownership interest changes to an entity’s legal structure or amendments to governing documents our vies are primarily t rowe price investment products  and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities 

we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant our sicav funds and other t rowe price investment products  regulated outside the us are determined to be vies at december 31 2017  we consolidated vies with net assets of 18001 million  

otherthantemporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in t rowe price investment products  as availableforsale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest nor exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each 

page  41 

    

investment to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income we review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

in determining whether a mutual fund holding is otherthantemporarily impaired we consider many factors including the duration of time the impairment has existed the severity of the impairment any subsequent changes in value and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value subject to the other considerations noted above we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an otherthantemporary impairment we may also recognize an otherthantemporary impairment for losses that have existed for less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments  we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti and certain investments in t rowe price investment products  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million  

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair valuebased method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes optionpricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair valuebased method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price us mutual funds  and other investment products  fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment products  and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment products  as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any otherthantemporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investees net income

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the following table presents the equity price risk from our investments in t rowe price investment products  as they are carried at fair value investments in these products  generally moderate market risk as they are diversified and invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international product s as well as diversification among equity and fixed income portfolios in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

we have chosen to use a variant of each product s net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each product s net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each of its investment objectives the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of these investments at yearend was determined by using the lower of each product ’s lowest net asset value per share during 2017  or its net asset value per share at december 31 2017  reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all product s experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  

for availableforsale investments any losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax until the investment is disposed of or if the investment is determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary 

the direct investment in consolidated t rowe price investment products  represents our portion of the net assets of the product  upon consolidation of these products  our direct investment is eliminated and the net assets of the products  are combined in our consolidated balance sheet together with redeemable noncontrolling interests which represents the portion of the products  that is owned by unrelated thirdparty investors any losses arising from the change in fair value of our direct investments in consolidated t rowe price investment products  would result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group 

certain of our investments including a few consolidated t rowe price investment products  expose us to foreign currency translation risk when their foreign denominated financial statements are translated into us dollars usd our most significant exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of our equity method investment in uti  1558 million  at december 31 2017  utis financial statements are denominated in indian rupees inr and are translated to usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this foreign currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss  net of tax of 306 million  at december 31 2017  related to our investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several foreign countries of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations although our revenues are predominately realized in usd we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

business

general 

t rowe price group inc is a financial services holding company that provides global investment management services through its subsidiaries to investors worldwide we provide an array of company sponsored us mutual funds other sponsored pooled investment vehicles subadvisory services separate account management recordkeeping and related services to individuals advisors institutions financial intermediaries and retirement plan sponsors we are focused on delivering global investment management excellence to help clients around the world achieve their longterm investment goals 

the late thomas rowe price jr founded our firm in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates inc was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000   

we derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenue and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries primarily t rowe price associates and t rowe price international ltd our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations at december 31 2016  we had 8108 billion  in assets under management including 5142 billion  in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us price funds and 2966 billion  in other investment portfolios 

2016  developments 

us stocks rose strongly in 2016  with major indexes finishing the year near record highs smallcap stocks substantially outperformed largecaps and it was the eighth consecutive year for a positive sp 500 index total return the sp 500 index and the nasdaq composite index which is heavily weighted in technology companies returned 120  and 75  respectively in 2016  developed nonus equity markets significantly underperformed us shares for the year as returns to us investors were hurt by a stronger dollar versus some major currencies global bond returns were mostly positive in 2016  

the table below presents financial results on a us gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis to adjust for the nonrecurring charge related to the dell appraisal rights matter the impact of our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and other nonoperating income we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results 



page  2 

    



1 nonoperating income varies from year to year due to a number of factors accordingly the percentage change in nonoperating income is not believed to be meaningful 

2 see the reconciliation to the comparable us gaap measures at the end of the results of operations sections of part ii item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

in 2016 we paid our clients 1662 million to compensate them for the denial of their appraisal rights in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of dell we made claims with our insurance carriers and on december 30 2016   entered into an agreement with our primary insurance carrier to recover 100 million from the claim the insurance proceeds were recognized as an offset to the related 1662 million charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016 remaining insurance claims filed with respect to this matter that could result in an additional recovery of up to 50 million are still pending 

our 2016  results were significantly impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related to consolidation and stockbased compensation the new consolidation guidance implemented in 2016 resulted in the consolidation of a larger number of sponsored investment portfolios in which we have provided initial seed capital the impact of implementing this new guidance is discussed in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies section of our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this filing 

the impact in millions the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios have on the individual lines of our 2016 consolidated statement of income is as follows 



assets under management 

assets under management ended 2016  at 8108 billion  an increase  of 477 billion  from the end of 2015  market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested of 505 billion  was offset in part by net cash outflows of 28 billion  during 2016  our net cash outflows for 2016 were largely attributable to clients reallocating to passive investments and the impact of our closed strategies in 2016  our net cash flows include 81 billion  that originated in our target date retirement portfolios which provide shareholders with single diversified portfolios that invest in underlying t rowe price funds and t rowe price collective investment trusts the assets under management in these portfolios totaled 1892 billion  at december 31 2016  including 1509 billion  in target date retirement funds and 383 billion  in target date retirement trusts these portfolios assets account for 233  of our managed assets at december 31 2016  compared with 217  at the end of 2015  

capital resources 

at december 31 2016  we remain debtfree with ample liquidity including cash and discretionary sponsored portfolio investment holdings of 19 billion  we also have seed capital investments in sponsored investment portfolios of about 13 billion  that are redeemable although we generally expect to be invested for several years until unrelated thirdparty investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage we paid 216  per share in regular dividends in 2016  an increase of 38  over the 208  per share in regular dividends paid in 2015  additionally we expended 6769 million  to repurchase 100 million  shares or 40  of our outstanding common stock in 2016  we invested 148 million during the year in capitalized technology and facilities from existing cash balances 

additional information concerning our revenues results of operations and total assets and our assets under management during the past three years is contained in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 as well as our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this form 10k

strategic initiatives 

our core capabilities have enabled us to deliver excellent operating results since our ipo in 1986 we maintain a clientcentric culture that is focused on delivering excellent longterm investment performance and worldclass service to our clients we have distributed our broad array of active investment strategies through a diverse set of distribution channels to meet the needs of our clients our ongoing financial strength has allowed us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service 

the market in which we operate has been evolving quickly and a number of headwinds have arisen over the last few years including a shifting demand from equities to incomeoriented solutions as the population ages demand for new vehicles to meet client needs an accelerating regulatory landscape and passive and alternative investments taking market share from active strategies 

despite the headwinds we believe there are significant opportunities that speak to our core capabilities as such we are responding with several multiyear initiatives that are designed to strengthen our longterm competitive position and can be categorized into three areas broadening our product offerings and vehicles strengthening and deepening distribution across all channels and strengthening our technology platform and digital capabilities 

investment management services 

distribution channels 

we distribute our products in countries located within three broad geographical regions north america europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac we accumulate our assets under management from a diversified client base across five primary distribution channels us financial intermediaries emea and apac financial intermediaries individual us investors on a direct basis us retirement plan sponsors for which we provide recordkeeping services and institutional investors globally investors domiciled outside the us represent nearly 5  of total assets under management at the end of 2016  we service clients in 45  countries around the world the following table outlines the types of vehicles within each distribution channel through which our assets under management are sourced as of december 31 2016

the following table shows our assets under management as of december 31 2016  by distribution channel by vehicle and account type

investment capabilities 

we manage a broad range of investment strategies in equity fixed income and asset allocation across sectors styles and regions our strategies are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors for the price funds investors select the fund based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus and can exchange balances among the funds as permitted when economic and market conditions or their investment needs change the investment objectives and investment management approaches employed in our other investment portfolios are similar to those in the price funds we also offer specialized advisory services including management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

the following table sets forth our broad investment capabilities as of december 31 2016 



page  5 

    

our assets under management by asset class were as follows as of december 31 2016 



nonus dollar denominated securities held in client accounts are 954 billion  or 118  of our total assets under management at december 31 2016  

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector 

our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the us and england with additional staff based in australia hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new strategies investment vehicles and other products to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period in 2016 we launched four new equity funds including three quantitatively managed funds one new fixed income fund and one new money market fund we also launched a suite of oeics for distribution through uk intermediaries and continued to add the iclass shares to certain price funds we betatested our new t rowe price activeplus portfolio offering which is a discretionary advice service in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will be formally launching to individual investors on a direct basis in early 2017 

we typically provide seed capital for new investment funds and trusts to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets the length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment portfolio as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the portfolio from unrelated investors we attempt to ensure that the new investment portfolio has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment portfolios net asset value or its investment performance record at december 31 2016  we had seed capital investments of 13 billion  in sponsored investment portfolios 

conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund or investment strategy in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing fund shareholders and investors at present the following are closed to new investors 



investment advisory fees 

we provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the price funds clients on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts target date retirement trusts funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us

ten price funds  growth stock  bluechip growth  midcap growth  capital appreciation  value  new income  equity income  new horizons  international stock  and emerging markets stock  accounted for approximately 37  of our investment advisory revenues in 2016  and approximately 30  of our assets under management at december 31 2016  our largest client account relationship apart from the price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 6  of our investment advisory revenues in 2016  

price funds 

at december 31 2016  assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 5142 billion  an increase of 56  or 271 billion  from the beginning of the year investment advisory services are provided to each us mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate for the majority of the price funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the price funds if the combined net assets of these price funds exceed 500 billion  the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 291 basis points  for the first 500 billion  of net assets plus 270 basis points  for net assets in excess of 500 billion  to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds including the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion the new income and value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 20 billion the effective fee rates for the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of approximately 60 million  or greater in 2016  varied from a low of 34  basis points for the limited duration inflation focused bond fund to a high of 104  basis points for the emerging markets stock international discovery and latin america funds 

the fee rate of several of the price funds including the index and summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and as a result our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of target date retirement funds that we offer invests in a diversified portfolio of other price funds and has no separate investment advisory fee rather they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured 

in 2016  we continued to voluntarily waive advisory fees and other fund expenses though to a lesser extent than in recent years of certain of our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain a positive yield for investors total fees waived in 2016  were 105 million  or less than 1 of total investment advisory revenues earned during the year compared to 476 million  in 2015  we expect that these fee waivers if any will be insignificant in 2017

other investment portfolios 

our other client investment portfolios had assets under management of 2966 billion  at december 31 2016  an increase of 206 billion  from the beginning of the year we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded

our fees for managing these other investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations monthend average valuations end of billing period valuations or beginning of bill period valuations in 2016  approximately 75  of advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 9  were based on monthend averages 15  were based on end of billing period valuations and 1  were based on beginning of billing period valuations

certain of the price funds also offer advisor class and r class shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes pay 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the price funds and enters into a triparty agreement with each intermediary and fund under the agreement each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries in addition those price funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statements of income we also recognize as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statements of income the corresponding cost paid to the thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these funds share classes the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media television and internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including the enhancement of our digital capabilities

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies hedge funds and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services 

in recent years we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies with competitors that offer such products taking market share from active managers like ourselves while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain we believe there will always be demand for good active management 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship 

employees 

at december 31 2016  we employed 6329  associates up 55  from the 5999  associates employed at the end of 2015  we may add additional temporary and parttime personnel to our staff from time to time to meet periodic and special project demands primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative services

risk factors 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased funds and portfolios at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 



page  11 

    

adversely affect investor behavior and may cause investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

the performance of our money market funds and portfolios have been impacted by the historically low interest rate environment 

our money market funds and portfolios performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund when interest rates are at or near historic lows the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolios net income thereby reducing the yield of the funds to very low levels the interest rate environment experienced since the second half of 2009 until recently led us to voluntarily waive our advisory and other fees earned on our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain yields at or above 0 for fund investors such actions have reduced our advisory fee income and net income fee waivers have been reduced significantly in 2016 as interest rates have increased over the year given the current interest rate environment we expect that our fee waivers in 2017 if any will not be significant the actual amount of fees waived is dependent on a number of variables including among others changes in the net assets held by our money market funds changes in market yields changes in the expense levels of the funds and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers for further discussion of the fees we waived in the current period managements expectation as to future fee waivers and the net cash flows of our money market funds and trusts please see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 of this form 10k 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

the market environment in recent years has led investors to increasingly favor lower fee passive products as a result investment advisors that emphasize passive products have gained and may continue to gain market share from active managers like us while we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain we believe there will always be demand for good active management 

if current or potential customers decide to move their assets to one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income in the event that we were to decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

page  12 

    

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel due to the global nature of our investment advisory business our key personnel may have reasons to travel to regions susceptible to higher risk of civil unrest organized crime or terrorism and we may be unable to ensure the safety of personnel traveling to these regions we have near and longterm succession planning processes including programs to develop our future leaders which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent however in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse effect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties litigation and a decrease in revenues 

operating risks include 

 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed additionally we are subject to the risk that our employees or third parties acting on our behalf may circumvent controls or act in a manner inconsistent with our policies and procedures any real or perceived conflict between our clients’ interests and our own as well as any fraudulent activity or other exposure of client assets or information may impair our reputation any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

 

 

page  13 

    

 

under our agreements with the price funds we charge the funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any of our sponsored investment products any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios in the us and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their clients assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region and in london england we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to 

page  14 

    

perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in sponsored investment portfolios all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments in the case of our availableforsale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to our sponsored investment portfolios that are consolidated held as trading or accounted for under the equity method in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position 

any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping additional or new regulatory requirements operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 26 investment in uti asset management company ltd uti an indian asset management company and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us and have an equity investment in uti our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations new regulations present areas of uncertainty susceptible to alternative interpretations regulators and prospective litigants may not agree with reasoned interpretations we adopt future changes could require us to modify or curtail 

page  15 

    

our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  16 

    

 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

in 2016 we paid 1662 million  to compensate certain t rowe price mutual funds trusts separately managed accounts and subadvised clients collectively “clients” for the denial of their appraisal rights by the delaware chancery court court in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of dell inc dell the court ruled on may 11 2016 that the clients could not pursue an appraisal of any shares they held that were voted in favor of the dell merger the appraisal statute governing the transaction required the record holder to vote against or abstain from voting on the transaction in order to assert appraisal rights after previously voting against prior transaction proposals the voting instructions submitted on behalf of the clients in connection with voting on the final proposed transaction were incorrectly submitted in favor of the transaction on may 31 2016 the court determined that the fair value of dell at the time of the merger was 1762 per share as opposed to the 1375 price offered in the transaction as a result any shareholder perfecting appraisal rights is entitled to a payment at 1762 per share plus statutory interest from the date the dell transaction closed the compensation to clients was intended to make them whole for the voting discrepancy that resulted in the denial of their appraisal rights on december 30 2016 we signed a settlement agreement with our insurance carrier for insurance proceeds totaling 1000 million related to this matter 

in accordance with the compensation payment the clients agreed that in the event the findings made by the court regarding the fair value of dell or the amount of interest to be applied were modified by the supreme court of delaware on appeal t rowe price and the clients would make an appropriate adjustment between themselves calculated in a manner that is consistent with the methodology used to compensate clients in december 2016 several parties including dell and the successful appraisal petitioners filed appeals to the delaware supreme court to challenge the chancery court’s valuation ruling our settlement agreement with the insurance carrier provides that if the fair value of dell is reduced we would work together to make appropriate adjustments 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

page  17 

    

united kingdom exit from european union 

we have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the united kingdom “uk” to support our global investment management business the ultimate impact of the uk exit “brexit” from the european union “eu” on our business operations in the uk and europe could vary depending on the details of the separation agreement we are preparing for multiple scenarios and remain committed to our clients associates and business expansion across the region 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

all of our technology systems including those provided by vendors are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks such as hacking or viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage and other causes a suspension or termination of vendorprovided software licenses or related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers we may use to maintain and transmit such information could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts involve costs that precede any future revenues that we recognize from an increase to our assets under management 

we remain debtfree with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future we expect to continue our investment in longterm initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally 

we expect to increase our pace of spending on a series of key strategic priorities to address evolving client needs and to grow and further diversify our business based on these planned initiatives we currently expect that our planned operating expenses excluding the net charge related to the dell appraisal rights matter will grow in the highsingledigit range in 2017 versus 2016 we could elect to moderate the pace of spending on our planned initiatives should markets decline significantly in addition other events not currently planned or expected could impact our expense levels 

background 

us stocks rose strongly in 2016 with major indexes finishing the year near record highs smallcap stocks substantially outperformed largecaps and it was the eighth consecutive year for a positive sp 500 index total return the year began with fears of a global economic slowdown which caused a short but sharp correction in equities and commodities us shares bottomed in midfebruary and worked their way higher through late june as commodity prices rebounded and the us dollar weakened due to diminishing expectations for federal reserve interest rate increases in 2016 in late june world equity markets experienced a brief but intense selloff as the uk unexpectedly voted in favor of leaving the european union however stocks resumed rising amid expectations that global central banks would provide additional monetary stimulus in the months prior to the november us elections the us market’s advance was hindered by political uncertainty as well as uncertainty about the timing of a possible interest rate increase as fed officials started cautioning that the case for raising shortterm rates had “strengthened” stocks surged following the us election results however the rally lost some steam in december as the fed raised shortterm rates in middecember and projected morethanexpected increases in 2017 

developed nonus equity markets significantly underperformed us shares for the year as returns to us investors were hurt by a stronger dollar versus some major currencies in dollar terms asian markets advanced for the year though japan

hong kong and singapore gained less than 3 european equity markets were widely mixed with italy—one of the worstperforming markets—dropping more than 9 due in part to its troubled banking sector 

emerging equity markets outperformed developed nonus markets brazil led the latin america region with a nearly 67 gain helped by rebounding commodity prices and by a new president pursuing reforms in emerging europe russian shares soared amid firming oil prices a stronger ruble and hopes for better relations with the us emerging asian markets were widely mixed 

results of several major equity market indexes for 2016  are as follows 



global bond returns were mostly positive in 2016 in the us intermediate and longterm treasury yields declined in the first half of the year then rebounded in the second half and finished the year above their yearend 2015 levels the 10year treasury note yield decreased from 23 at the end of 2015 to less than 14 around midyear then it rose to around 25  by the end of 2016 in the investmentgrade universe corporate bonds were among the best performers longerterm treasuries generated modest returns municipal securities were flat for the year as they surrendered earlier gains during the fourth quarter amid rising interest rates and cash outflows high yield bonds strongly outperformed helped by their lower interest rate sensitivity investors’ demand for securities with attractive yields and a rebound in oil prices 

bonds in developed nonus markets produced modest positive returns in dollar terms as significant firsthalf gains driven by us currency weakness and falling sovereign debt yields were largely offset by a reversal of these trends in the latter half of the year bonds in emerging markets produced solid gains as firsthalf returns driven by dollar weakness and investors’ search for attractive yields were only partially eroded by a stronger us dollar in the second half

assets under management 

our assets under management ended 2016  at 8108 billion  an increase  of 477 billion  from the end of 2015  during 2016  market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested of 505 billion  was offset in part by net cash outflows of 28 billion  investment advisory clients outside the us account for about 5  of our assets under management at december 31 2016  





our target date retirement portfolios which invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other t rowe price funds or t rowe price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings continue to be a significant part of our assets under management assets under management at december 31 2016  in these target date portfolios totaled 1892 billion  including 1509 billion  in target date retirement funds and 383 billion  in target date retirement trusts 

the following table presents the component changes in assets under management for 2014 2015 and 2016 



page  25 

    



in 2014 the majority of the assets transferred by clients from our sponsored mutual funds to our other investment portfolios disclosed in the table above were moved from our target date retirement funds to our collective investment trusts and target date retirement trusts in 2015 and 2016 assets were transferred from both target date retirement funds and other mutual funds to our collective investment trusts target date retirement trusts and separate accounts 

the net cash flows after client transfers in billions by investment vehicle and asset class over the last three years are as follows 



the net cash inflows in our sponsored us mutual funds over the last three years were sourced primarily from thirdparty financial intermediaries across various mandates as detailed below 

in 2014 the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were primarily from a few institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies in 2015 the net inflows in our other investment portfolios resulted primarily from the client transfers received from the mutual funds the net outflows prior to the transfers into these portfolios were largely concentrated among a small number of institutional clients who redeemed primarily from largecap us equity strategies in 2016 our net cash outflows are largely attributable to institutional and intermediary clients reallocating to passive investments and the impact of our closed investment strategies the general trend to passive also impacted the net cash flows originating in our target date retirement portfolios this trend has been persistent and has accelerated in recent years however over the long term we expect wellexecuted active management to play an important role for investors and we are reinvesting in our company with the objective of delivering strong investment performance and excellent client service like we have historically achieved

investment performance 

strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting and retaining assets—and to our longterm success although investment performance relative to our peers has weakened in 2016 it has been strong over the longer term the percentage of our price funds across their share classes that outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis and percentage in top lipper quartile for the 1 3 5 and 10years ended december 31 2016  were 

in addition nearly 86  of our price funds assets under management ended december 31 2016  with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks weakened in 2016 but remains very competitive over longer time periods 

results of operations 

the table below presents financial results on a us gaap basis as well as a nongaap basis to adjust for the nonrecurring charge related to the dell appraisal rights matter the impact of the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and other nonoperating income we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results 



1 nonoperating income varies from year to year due to a number of factors accordingly the percentage change in nonoperating income is not believed to be meaningful 

2 see the reconciliation to the comparable us gaap measures at the end of the results of operations sections of part ii item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

page  27 

    

as detailed in the table above the percentage increase in investment advisory revenues in 2016  was in line with the increase in our average assets under management we waived 105 million  in money marketrelated fees including advisory fees and fund expenses in 2016 a decrease of 371 million  from the 476 million  waived in the 2015  period the fee waivers in 2016 represent less than 5 of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period these fees were waived from certain of our money market mutual funds and trusts which have combined net assets of 157 billion at december 31 2016  we expect money market fee waivers if any will be insignificant in 2017 the annual fee rate earned on our assets under management was 479 basis points  in 2016 virtually unchanged from the 480 basis points  earned in 2015 the impact on our effective fee rate from the reduction in money market waivers in 2016 was offset by effective fee rate reductions in certain of our sponsored us mutual funds 

our operating expenses include a nonrecurring charge net of insurance recovery of 662 million or 15  per share after tax related to the dell appraisal rights matter in 2016 we paid our clients 1662 million to compensate them for the denial of their appraisal rights in connection with the 2013 leveraged buyout of dell we made claims with our insurance carriers and on december 30 2016   entered into an agreement with our primary insurance carrier to recover 100 million from the claim the insurance proceeds were recognized as an offset to the related 1662 million charge recognized in the second quarter of 2016 remaining insurance claims filed with respect to this matter that could result in an additional recovery of up to 50 million are still pending 

our operating margin in 2016  was 410  compared to 452  in the 2015 period without the impact of the nonrecurring charge relating to the dell appraisal rights matter our operating margin in 2016 would have been 426 the additional decline in our 2016 operating margin results primarily from the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management distribution and service capabilities around the world 

our 2016  results were significantly impacted by the adoption of new accounting guidance related to consolidation and stockbased compensation the impacts of implementing this new guidance is discussed in more detail in the summary of significant accounting policies section of our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this filing 

the impact in millions the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios have on the individual lines of our 2016 consolidated statement of income is as follows 



net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us increased 14  or 375 million  to 27 billion  average mutual fund assets in 2016  were 4955 billion  an increase  of 4  from the average for the comparable 2015  period the increase in advisory revenues was due in part to the reduction in money market fee waivers realized in 2016  compared with 2015  

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios for 2016  were 10233 million  an increase  of 39 million  or 4  from the 10194 million  earned in 2015  average assets in these portfolios were 2827 billion  during 2016  up   31  from the comparable 2015  period in 2016 our advisory revenues are presented net of 70 million  related to the elimination of management fees earned on the net assets of certain of our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios we eliminated these advisory fees in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

administrative fee revenues decrease d 93 million  to 3525 million  in 2016  the decrease is primarily attributable to transfer agent servicing activities provided to the mutual funds and their investors as well as the shift of fund accounting and portfolio recordkeeping operations to bny mellon that prior to august 2015 we provided to our sponsored us mutual funds changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

page  28 

    

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor r and variable annuity ii class shares of our sponsored portfolios were 1417 million  in 2016  a decrease  of 98 million  from the comparable 2015  period on lower average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to third party intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs was 14940 million  in 2016  an increase  of 504 million  or 35  compared to the 2015  period the largest part of the increase  is attributable to a 567 million   increase  in salaries and related benefits which resulted from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2016  combined with a 32  increase in average headcount from 2015  noncash stockbased compensation expense and annual variable compensation were up 126 million  and 49 million  respectively these increases were offset by a higher level of technology labor capitalized in 2016 compared with 2015 and a reduction in temporary labor cost as the 2016 projects used more professional service resources the overall increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size from 2015  were muted by lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates in august 2015 to bny mellon and for the ongoing transition support we provide to them however these lower compensation costs are generally offset by increases in costs paid to bny mellon to provide these administrative services and other transitionrelated activities which are reflected in other operating expenses 

advertising and promotion costs were 799 million  in 2016  compared with 797 million  in 2015  we currently expect advertising and promotion costs for 2017 to be up to 10 higher than the 2016  year as we execute on a number of strategic initiatives 

  

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased   207 million  or 73  compared to 2015  the increase is primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities including related maintenance programs 

other operating expenses were 4015 million  in 2016  an increase  of 601 million  from 2015  about half of this increase is attributable to costs being paid to bny mellon since august 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services as mentioned above the increase also includes 65 million  in operating expenses net of investment advisory fees earned by us of those sponsored investment portfolios that we began consolidating at the beginning of 2016 the remaining balance of the change is due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities 

nonoperating income 

net nonoperating investment activity during 2016  resulted in income of 2271 million  compared with 1035 million  in 2015  the following table details the components of nonoperating income in millions during the 2015  and 2016  



the increase in investment gains on sponsored equity method and trading investments is driven by an increase in the number of sponsored funds accounted for as equity method investments as well as market gains the investment income on consolidated 

page  29 

    

sponsored investment portfolios has increased in 2016  as the number of portfolios we consolidate as discussed earlier in this section increased significantly upon the adoption of the new consolidation accounting guidance see the summary of significant accounting policies  in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing for more information related to the impact of the guidance 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2016 was 360  compared to 389  in 2015 the decrease in the effective tax rate is related in part to the increase in net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest related to our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios as we do not recognize taxes associated with these earnings additionally the estimated effective tax rate has declined as a result of adopting the new stockbased compensation accounting guidance as discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the consolidated financial statements contained in part ii item 8 of this filing under the new guidance tax benefits and shortfalls on exercised options and vested restricted stock relative to the stockbased compensation expense recognized are included in the provision for income taxes rather than as additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheet our effective income tax rate also reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from us and foreign sources or changes in tax rates in relevant jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future we currently estimate that our effective tax rate for 2017 to be 365  our 2017 estimate assumes the tax benefits related to stockbased compensation will be similar to those realized in 2016 

2015 versus 2014 



investment advisory revenues earned in 2015 increased over 2014 as our average assets under management increased 432 billion or 60 to 7679 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 480 basis points in 2015 up from the 478 basis points earned in 2014 as money market fee waivers declined and equity valuations which on average carry a higher fee rate increased in 2015 we waived 476 million in money marketrelated fees in 2015 including advisory fees and fund expenses a decrease of 108 million from the 584 million waived in 2014 the fee waivers in 2015 represent 13 of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period fees were waived from all our money market mutual funds and trusts which have combined net assets of 157 billion at december 31 2015 

our operating margin in 2015 was 452 compared to 475 in the 2014 period the decline is a result of the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management distribution and service capabilities around the world despite the impact of market volatility on our net revenues 

net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us increased 73 or 1821 million to nearly 27 billion on higher average mutual fund assets average mutual fund assets in 2015 were 4936 billion an increase of 71 from the average for the comparable 2014 period 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios in 2015 were 10 billion an increase of 407 million or 42 from the 9787 million earned in the comparable 2014 period average assets in these portfolios were 2743 billion in 2015 up 40 from the comparable 2014 period 

page  30 

    

administrative fee revenues decreased 122 million to 3618 million in 2015 the decrease includes the reduction in certain administrative service fee rates paid by certain fund shareholders at the beginning of 2015 additionally fees earned from the mutual funds for fund accounting has declined in 2015 compared to 2014 as such services began to be performed by bny mellon in august 2015 the mutual funds have contracted directly with bny mellon to provide such services changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor class r class and variable annuity ii class shares of our sponsored portfolios were 1515 million in 2015 an increase of 79 million from 2014 on greater average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs were 14 billion in 2015 an increase of 1140 million or 86 compared to 2014 the largest part of the increase is attributable to a 526 million increase in salaries and related benefits and a 430 million increase in our annual variable compensation program our average staff size in 2015 increased 37 over 2014 and we employed 5999 associates at december 31 2015 higher noncash stockbased compensation expense and temporary staff expense account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2015 period the increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size were muted by the lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates and providing ongoing transition support to bny mellon with whom we contracted to provide fund accounting and recordkeeping operations however these lower compensation costs are offset by increases in costs paid to bny mellon to provide these administrative services which are reflected in other operating expenses 

advertising and promotion costs were 797 million in 2015 an increase of 37 million from 2014 the higher cost is primarily attributable to the creation and launch of a new advertising campaign and increased participation in promotional activities as we broaden our distribution reach 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 299 million or 117 compared to 2014 the increase is primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities including related maintenance programs 

other operating expenses were 3414 million in 2015 an increase of 550 million from 2014 about a third of the increase is attributable to costs being paid to bny mellon since august 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services the balance of the change is due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities these costs include information and thirdparty service costs costs related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business travelrelated costs and other general and administrative costs

nonoperating investment income 

net nonoperating investment activity during 2015 resulted in income of 1035 million a decrease of 87 million from 2014 net losses recognized on our sponsored fund investments of 123 million were offset in part by other investment income of 36 million the following table details the components of nonoperating investment income in millions during 2014 and 2015 



the net loss recognized on deconsolidation represents the reclassification of a foreign currency loss that was accumulated in other comprehensive income from the date we made our initial seed capital investment in an australian dollardenominated fund since the deconsolidation we are accounting for the investment under the equity method of accounting 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 389 in 2015 compared to 386 in 2014 our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates

nongaap information and reconciliation 

we believe the nongaap financial measures below provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about our core operating results these measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating our core business for comparing current results with prior period results and to enable more appropriate comparison with industry peers however nongaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with us gaap and may be calculated differently by other companies the following schedule reconciles in millions except for pershare amounts us gaap financial measures to nongaap measures for each of the last five years 



page  33 

    

1  we implemented new consolidation accounting guidance on january 1 2016 that resulted in a larger number of our sponsored investment portfolios that we provide seed capital to at inception to be consolidated in our financial statements as we were deemed to have a controlling financial interest we now recognize investment gains and losses on a larger number of the investments in sponsored portfolios in our consolidated statement of income compared to our consolidated statement of comprehensive income in 2015 the nongaap adjustments add back the management fees we earn from the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and remove the investment income and operating expenses of these portfolios that have been included in our us gaap consolidated statements of income we believe the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios may impact the readers ability to understand our core operating results the following table details the amounts and consolidated statement of income line items in which the amounts were recognized 



2 this nongaap adjustment removes the nonoperating income that remains after backing out the portion related to the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios we believe excluding nonoperating income helps the readers ability to understand the firm’s core operating results and increases comparability to prior years additionally we do not emphasize the impact of nonoperating income when managing our firm and evaluating our performance 



3 as previously disclosed we made the decision in 2016 to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter we also recognized an offset to this charge for a related insurance recovery we believe it is useful to readers of our consolidated statement of income to adjust for this nonrecurring charge net of the insurance recovery in arriving at adjusted operating expenses net income attributable to t rowe price group inc and diluted earnings per share as this will aid with comparability to prior periods and analyzing our core business results 

  

4 these were calculated using the effective tax rate applicable to the related items 

5  this nongaap measure was calculated by applying the twoclass method to adjusted net income attributable to t rowe price group inc divided by the weightedaverage common shares outstanding assuming dilution 

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2016  stockholders’ equity increase d from 48 billion  to 50 billion  tangible book value increased to 43 billion  at december 31 2016  we paid 216  per share in regular dividends in 2016  an increase of 38  over the 208  per share in regular dividends paid in 2015  additionally we expended 6769 million  to repurchase 100 million  shares or 40  of our outstanding common stock in 2016  these dividends and repurchases were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations we will generally repurchase our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans in december 2016  our board of directors increased our share repurchase program by 12 million  shares 

page  34 

    

as detailed below we have returned 41 billion  to stockholders over the last three years through stock repurchases our regular quarterly dividends and a special dividend in 2015 



we remain debtfree with ample liquidity including cash and discretionary sponsored portfolio investment holdings of 19 billion  at december 31 2016  we also have seed capital investments in sponsored investment portfolios of 13 billion  that are redeemable although we generally expect to be invested for several years until unrelated thirdparty investors substantially reduce our relative ownership percentage the cash and discretionary sponsored investment holdings held by our subsidiaries outside the us is 4 million at december 31 2016  

the following table details in millions the line items of the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016  where our cash and discretionary sponsored portfolio investment holdings and seed capital investments are presented as well as the amount of other investments we hold that make up the remainder of the investments line in the financial statements the investment presentation on the consolidated balance sheet is based on the type of investment as well as how we account for it 

on january 1 2016 we implemented new consolidation accounting guidance that resulted in the consolidation of sponsored investment portfolios in which we have a controlling interest our consolidated balance sheet now reflects the cash and cash equivalents investments other assets and liabilities of the sponsored portfolios as well as redeemable noncontrolling interests for the portion of the sponsored portfolios that are held by unrelated thirdparty investors although we can redeem our net interest in these sponsored investment portfolios at any time we cannot directly access or sell the assets held by the portfolios to obtain cash for general operations additionally the assets of these investment portfolios are not available to our general creditors our interest in these sponsored investment portfolios was used as initial seed capital and is recategorized as discretionary when it is determined by management that the seed capital is no longer needed we assess the discretionary investment portfolio and when we liquidate our interest we do so in a way as to not impact the portfolio and ultimately the unrelated thirdparty investors 

we anticipate property and equipment expenditures in 2017  to be up to 175 million  of which about twothirds is planned for technology initiatives given the availability of our financial resources we expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures with operating resources and do not maintain an available external source of liquidity

2016  versus 2015  

the following table summarizes the cash flows in millions for 2016  that are attributable to t rowe price group our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and the related eliminations required in preparing the statement 



operating activities attributable to t rowe price group during 2016  provided cash flows of 13437 million  a decrease of 1868 million  from the 2015  period the decline is primarily related to the payments totaling 1662 million we made in 2016  to compensate certain clients in regard to the dell appraisal rights matter we entered into an agreement on december 30 2016 for a 100 million insurance recovery that we received in january 2017 the net cash provided by operating activities attributable to t rowe price group was offset in part by the net change in trading securities held in our consolidated sponsored investments’ underlying investment portfolios 

net cash used in investing activities that are attributable to t rowe price group totaled 2197 million  in 2016  in 2016  we provided 2845 million  in seed capital to new and existing sponsored investment portfolios we utilized a portion of the 2195 million in proceeds from the sale of certain availableforsale investments and equity method investments in 2016  to fund these seed capital investments since we consolidate these sponsored investment portfolios the seed capital that we provided was eliminated in preparing our consolidated statement of cash flow in 2015 cash proceeds from the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings net of new investments resulted in investing cash flows of 2697 million additionally our net property and equipment additions were 1483 million  in 2016  compared to 1513 million  in the 2015  period the cash flow attributable to consolidated sponsored investment portfolios of 414 million  represents the net cash added to our consolidated balance sheet from consolidating and deconsolidating portfolios in 2016  

net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group was 10914 million  in 2016  compared with 19733 million  in the 2015  period the decline in cash used in financing activities is largely related to the 200 per share or 524 million special dividend we paid in april 2015 we also expended 3109 million  less in common stock purchases in 2016  compared to the 2015 period the cash proceeds received from stock option exercises were higher in 2016  by 528 million   

page  36 

    

compared with the 2015  period the net cash used in financing activities attributable to t rowe price group was largely offset by the 9150 million  of net subscriptions into the consolidated sponsored investment portfolios 

2015  versus 2014  

operating activities during 2015 provided cash flows of 15 billion up 2151 million from the 2014 period we used 750 million less cash in 2015 compared with the 2014 period as we seeded fewer new sponsored investment portfolios higher noncash depreciation and amortization and noncash stockbased compensation in 2015 increased cash flows by 302 million timing differences on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities increased our operating cash flows by 1148 million compared to 2014 more than half of the timing difference on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities is related to bonus compensation that was deferred by certain employees under the new supplemental savings plan that went into effect in 2015 the supplemental savings plan provides certain senior officers the opportunity to defer any portion of their cash incentive compensation earned for a respective calendar year during which services are provided for a period of two or more years 

net cash provided by investing activities totaled 1090 million in 2015 compared with net cash used of 4434 million in the 2014 period in 2015 cash proceeds from the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings net of new investments resulted in investing cash flows of 2697 million this compares with net investments of 3053 million that we made into our sponsored fund investments in 2014 we increased our property and equipment additions by 251 million during 2015 compared to the 2014 period 

net cash used in financing activities was 19492 million in 2015 up 12094 million from the comparable 2014 period the payment of a 200 special dividend on april 23 2015 and an 18 increase in our regular quarterly pershare dividend accounted for 5969 million of the increase from 2014 we also increased our common stock repurchases by 5723 million during 2015 compared with 2014 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2016  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2017  and future years the information also excludes the 62 million  of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 



we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 464 million  at december 31 2016  the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

page  37 

    

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2016  annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

consolidation  we consolidate all subsidiaries and sponsored investment portfolios in which we have a controlling interest we are generally deemed to have a controlling interest when we own the majority of the voting interest of an entity or are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie vies are entities that lack sufficient equity to finance its activities or the equity holders do not have defined power to direct the activities of the entity normally associated with an equity investment our analysis to determine whether an entity is a vie or a voting interest entity voe involves judgment and considers several factors including an entity’s legal organization capital structure the rights of the equity investment holders our ownership interest in the entity and our contractual involvement with the entity we continually review and reconsider our vie or voe conclusions upon the occurrence of certain events such as changes to our ownership interest changes to an entity’s legal structure or amendments to governing documents our vies are primarily sponsored investment entities and our variable interest consists of our equity ownership in and investment management fees earned from these entities 

we are the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant our sicav funds and other sponsored investment portfolios regulated outside the us are determined to be vies at december 31 2016 we consolidated vies with net assets of 13893 million  

otherthantemporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds as availableforsale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest nor exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income we review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

in determining whether a mutual fund holding is otherthantemporarily impaired we consider many factors including the duration of time the impairment has existed the severity of the impairment any subsequent changes in value and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value subject to the other considerations noted above we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an otherthantemporary impairment we may also recognize an otherthantemporary impairment for losses that have existed for less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments  we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti and other sponsored investment holdings for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit—our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million  

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair valuebased method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes optionpricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in 

page  38 

    

the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair valuebased method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 — revenue from contracts with customers and subsequently has issued five related accounting standard updates clarifying several aspects of asu 201409 including technical corrections and improvements the overall objective of the new standards updates is to provide a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries across industries and across capital markets the revenue standard contains principles that will be applied to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized we anticipate adopting the new standard on its effective date january 1 2018 though we have not yet selected whether we would adopt using the retrospective approach with adjustments to each prior period or the retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initial application recognized at the date of initial application while we are continuing to assess all potential impacts these standards will have on our financial position and results of operations early conclusions indicate that these standards will not have a material impact our implementation efforts include the identification of revenue within the scope of the guidance as well as the evaluation of revenue contracts while we have not identified material changes in the timing of revenue recognition we continue to evaluate the presentation of certain revenuerelated costs on a gross versus net basis and related disclosures of revenue 

in january 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201601 — financial instruments — overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities the amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and requires a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption early adoption is not permitted the new guidance will require the change in fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be recognized through the income statements we are currently evaluating the full impact of the standard however upon adoption the change in the fair value of our availableforsale investments will be recognized in our consolidated income statement rather than our consolidated statement of comprehensive income 

in february 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201602 — leases topic 842 the objective of the update is to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations though we expect that our real estate leases will be recognized on our consolidated balance sheet 

in august 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201605 — statement of cash flows topic 230 classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments a consensus of the emerging issues task force the amendments in this update provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issues the new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal 

years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows 

page  39 

    

we have considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements including that which we have not yet adopted we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation 

forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to our revenues net income and earnings per share on common stock changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels our estimated effective income tax rate and our expectations regarding financial markets future transactions dividends investments capital expenditures and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k annual report further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any otherthantemporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investees net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising and promotion expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the us and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the us the pace and level of our planned increase in spending to support key strategic priorities variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses restricted stock units and other equity grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as fund and portfolio recordkeeping facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from our investments in our sponsored investment portfolios as they are carried at fair value investments in these portfolios generally moderate market risk as they are diversified portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds as well as diversification among equity and fixed income portfolios in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

we have chosen to use a variant of each portfolios net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each portfolios net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each of its investment objectives the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of these fund investments at yearend was determined by using the lower of each portfolio’s lowest net asset value per share during 2016  or its net asset value per share at december 31 2016  reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all portfolios experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  

for availableforsale securities any losses arising from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax until the investment is disposed of or if the investment is determined to be otherthantemporarily impaired we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary 

the direct investment in consolidated sponsored investment portfolios represents our portion of the net assets of the portfolio upon consolidation of these portfolios our direct investment is eliminated and the net assets of the portfolio are combined in our consolidated balance sheet together with redeemable noncontrolling interest which represents the portion of the portfolio that is owned by unrelated thirdparty investors any losses arising from the change in fair value of our direct investments in consolidated sponsored investment portfolios would result in a corresponding decrease net of tax in our net income attributable to t rowe price group 

certain of our investments including a few consolidated sponsored investment portfolios expose us to foreign currency translation risk when their foreign denominated financial statements are translated into us dollars our most significant exposure relates to the translation of the financial statements of our equity method investment in uti  1409 million  at december 31 2016  whose financial statements are denominated in indian rupees inr and are translated to us dollars usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this foreign currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss  net of tax of 323 million  at december 31 2016  related to our investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several foreign countries of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations although our revenues are predominately realized in usd we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

business 

tableend 

t rowe price group inc is a financial services holding company that provides global investment management services through its subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and other investment portfolios these other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the united states and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

the late thomas rowe price jr founded our firm in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates inc was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000 

we derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenue and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries primarily t rowe price associates and t rowe price international ltd our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations at december 31 2015  we had 7631 billion  in assets under management including 4871 billion  in the price funds and 2760 billion  in other investment portfolios 

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base across four primary distribution channels thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and other countries individual us investors on a direct basis us defined contribution retirement plans and institutional investors globally as of december 31 2015  more than fortyfive percent  of our assets under management are sourced from our thirdparty financial intermediary distribution channel with the remaining three distribution channels comprising the balance we have taken steps to broaden and deepen our distribution reach in overseas markets and with financial intermediaries in the us europe and asia these initiatives are part of multiyear plans designed to further diversify our assets under management and client base for the foreseeable future we will continue to make key hires and make investments in infrastructure to support these initiatives 

the assets we manage are a broad range of us and international stock blended asset bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investors select mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus and can exchange balances among the funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change the investment objectives and investment management approaches employed in our other investment portfolios are similar to those in the price funds we also offer specialized advisory services including management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global multiregional and regional international emerging market and sector investing our fixed income strategies may focus on high yield us taxable bond taxable lowduration international global and municipal taxfree investing we also combine strategies across asset classes to create solutions that help our clients achieve a single investment objective to this end we offer systematic taxefficient blended equity and asset allocation investment strategies including targetdate retirement investment portfolios 

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the us and england with additional staff based in australia hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new strategies and investment vehicles to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management 

page  2 

    

expertise and that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period we continued to expand our investment offerings in 2015 with new equity and fixed income strategies and the launch of new investment vehicles we have launched three new fixed income products—global unconstrained global high income global investment grade corporate bond—and one new equity product emerging markets value we also launched a new retirement date series for institutional investors and added an ishare class to a number of existing price funds the iclass shares are designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios we plan to add the ishare class to other price funds in 2016 

we typically provide seed capital for new investment funds and trusts to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets the length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment portfolio as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the portfolio from unrelated investors we attempt to ensure that the new investment portfolio has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment portfolios net asset value or its investment performance record at december 31 2015  nearly 10 billion  of our investments in sponsored portfolios and those sponsored portfolio investments reported in other investments is considered seed investments about 60 of our total seed capital investments of 10 billion are investments in fixed income strategies and the remaining are investments in equity and asset allocation strategies 

conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund or investment strategy in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing fund shareholders and investors at present the following mutual funds and affiliated other investment portfolio strategies are closed to new investors 



we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting distribution and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the t rowe price complex brokerage and trust services substantially all of our administrative and distribution and servicing fee revenues in 2015  were determined based generally on the recovery of our related costs to provide these services therefore changes in our administrative fees distribution and servicing fees and related expenses generally do not significantly affect our net operating income or net income 

in 2014 we made a longterm strategic decision to change our delivery of certain administrative services including fund accounting and other investment recordkeeping operations bny mellon was contracted to provide such services and 210 associates became employees of bny mellon on august 1 2015 bny mellon will transition our data to its technology platform over time though a few line items of our consolidated income statements including administrative revenues compensation and related costs and other operating expenses will be affected we do not expect that the net impact on our future operating results will be material

2015  developments 

us equities as measured by the sp 500 index rose in 2015  for the seventh consecutive year the sp 500 index and the nasdaq composite index which is heavily weighted in technology companies returned 14  and 57  respectively in 2015  equities in developed nonus markets were mixed while emerging market equities fared poorly around the world due in part to the broad currency weakness versus the us dollar which hurt investor returns in dollar terms global bonds returns were also mixed in 2015  in this market environment our 2015 results were as follows 



six price funds  growth stock  bluechip growth  midcap growth  value  capital appreciation  and equity income  accounted for 27  of our investment advisory revenues in 2015  and 22  of our assets under management at december 31 2015  our largest client account relationship apart from the price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 5  of our investment advisory revenues in 2015  

assets under management ended 2015  at 7631 billion  an increase  of 163 billion  from the end of 2014  market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 147 billion  and net cash inflows added 16 billion  in assets under management during 2015  

our targetdate retirement funds and trusts which provide shareholders with single diversified portfolios that invest in underlying t rowe price funds and t rowe price collective investment trusts continue to be a significant source of our asset growth in 2015  our net cash flows include 162 billion  that originated in these portfolios including 89 billion  in our targetdate retirement funds the assets under management in these portfolios totaled 1657 billion  at december 31 2015  including 1355 billion  in targetdate retirement funds and 302 billion  in targetdate retirement trusts these portfolios assets account for 217  of our managed assets at december 31 2015  compared with 199  at the end of 2014  

page  4 

    

details of our assets under management in billions at december 31 2015  are as follows 

nonus dollar denominated securities held in client accounts are 1052 billion  or 138  of our total assets under management at december 31 2015  investors domiciled outside the us represent nearly 5  of total assets under management at the end of 2015  we service clients in 41  countries around the world 

investment performance 

strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our longterm success as of the end of 2015  80  of the t rowe price us mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the threeyear  period 78  outperformed for the fiveyear  period 88  outperformed for the 10year  period and 80  outperformed for the oneyear  period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar at december 31 2015  account for nearly 86  of the assets under management in our rated funds our targetdate retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive longterm performance with at least 97  of these funds outperforming their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three five and 10year periods ended december 31 2015  the performance of our institutional strategies remains very competitive 

capital resources 

at december 31 2015  we remain debtfree with ample liquidity and resources including cash and sponsored portfolio investment holdings of nearly 28 billion  during the full year of 2015  we expended 9878 million to repurchase 131 million  shares or 5  of our outstanding common stock we generally repurchase shares of our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans we declared and paid regular quarterly dividends in 2015 that totaled 208  per share as well as a special dividend of 200 per share 

we also invested 151 million during the year in capitalized technology and facilities from existing cash balances we currently expect total capital expenditures for technology development facilities and equipment for 2016  to be up to 180 million  which will be funded from operating resources 

our substantial liquidity and resources also allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new investment strategy offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future in the coming years we expect to increase funding for longterm initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally

additional information concerning our revenues results of operations and total assets and our assets under management during the past three years is contained in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10k as well as our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this report 

price funds 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

advisory services 

investment advisory revenues earned from the price funds are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate details of each funds fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

for the majority of the price funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the price funds if the combined net assets of these price funds exceed 500 billion  the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 291 basis points  for the first 500 billion  of net assets plus 270 basis points  for net assets in excess of 500 billion  to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds including the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion the new income and value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 20 billion the effective fee rates for the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of at least 60 million  in 2015  varied from a low of 33  basis points for the limited duration inflation focused bond fund to a high of 104  basis points for the emerging markets stock international discovery and latin america funds 

the fee rate of several of the price funds including the index and summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors do not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds that we offer invests in a diversified portfolio of other price funds and has no separate investment advisory fee rather they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured 

in 2015  we continued to voluntarily waive advisory fees and other fund expenses of all of our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain a positive yield for investors total fees waived in 2015  were 476 million  or about 1  of total 

page  6 

    

investment advisory revenues earned during the year compared to 584 million  in 2014  we expect that these fee waivers will continue in 2016  

assets under management 

at december 31 2015  assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 4871 billion  an increase of 20  or 95 billion  from the beginning of the year the following table presents the net assets in billions and the year of formation of our largest price funds net assets in excess of 10 billion  at december 31 2015  at december 31

distribution and servicing 

the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the us on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and fixed income portfolios in 2015 we added an iclass share to a number of our price funds the iclass shares are designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios this share class will limit ordinary operating expenses other than interest expenses related to borrowings taxes and brokerage and any non extraordinary expenses at 5 basis points for a period of time and there will be no external payments for 12b1 or administrative fee payments 

certain of the price funds also offer advisor class and r class shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes pay 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the price funds and enters into a triparty agreement with each intermediary and fund under the agreement each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries in addition those price funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statements of income we also recognize as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statements of income the corresponding cost paid to the thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these fund share classes the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media television and internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including the enhancement of our digital capabilities 

other investment portfolios 

our other client investment portfolios had assets under management of 2760 billion  at december 31 2015  an increase of 68 billion  from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us at december 31 the assets under management in these portfolios included the following investment mandates 



we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded 

page  9 

    

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations monthend average valuations or end of billing period valuations in 2015  approximately 73  of advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 10  were based on monthend averages and 17  were based on end of billing period valuations 

our subsidiaries t rowe price luxembourg management sàrl and t rowe price international provide management company and investment management services respectively to our luxembourgbased sicavs société dinvestissement à capital variable and fcps fonds commun de placement these funds are distributed outside the us through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries the fees earned for these distribution and marketing services are part of the overall investment management fees earned for managing the sicav and fcp fund assets we recognize any related distribution fees paid to financial intermediaries in other operating expenses at december 31 2015 assets under management in these funds were 103 billion

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies hedge funds and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services in recent years we have faced significant competition from passive and index oriented investment strategies in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position

risk factors 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased funds and portfolios at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

 

page  11 

    

 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

the performance of our money market funds and portfolios are impacted by the historically low interest rate environment 

our money market funds and portfolios performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund when interest rates are at or near the historic lows the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolios net income thereby reducing the yield of the funds to very low levels since the second half of 2009 such an environment has led us to voluntarily waive our advisory and other fees earned on our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain yields at or above 0 for fund investors such actions reduce our advisory fee income and net income the actual amount of fees waived is dependent on a number of variables including among others changes in the net assets held by our money market funds changes in market yields changes in the expense levels of the funds and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers also bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds could experience significant redemptions which could decrease our revenues and net income for further discussion of the fees we waived in the current period managements expectation as to future fee waivers and the net cash flows of our money market funds and trusts please see our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10k 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

page  12 

    

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from other financial institutions many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income in the event that we were to decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel we have near and longterm succession planning processes including programs to develop our future leaders which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent however in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse effect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties litigation and a decrease in revenues 

operating risks include 

 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain 

page  13 

    

customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

 

under our agreements with the t rowe price mutual funds we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any of our sponsored investment products any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios in the us and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

 

page  14 

    

 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region and in london england we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in sponsored stock blended asset and bond funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments in the case of our availableforsale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to our sponsored investment portfolios that are held as trading and accounted for under the equity method in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position 

any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping additional or new regulatory requirements operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 26 investment in uti asset management company ltd uti an indian asset management company and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us and have an equity investment in uti our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any 

page  15 

    

regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or have other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page  16 

    

investments in derivatives as well as adopting derivatives risk management programs there remains uncertainty related to various requirements under these regulations and the exact manner in which they will impact current trading strategies for our clients 

 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

government action related to continued membership in the european union 

we have a significant locally authorized and regulated presence in the united kingdom uk to support our global investment management business it is likely the uk will hold a referendum regarding continued membership in the european union eu a uk exit from the eu would be extremely disruptive to our operations and require us to analyze potential changes to our corporate structure and european product and distribution strategies any such changes if required would likely subject us to additional regulatory requirements and costs 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

page  17 

    

 

all of our technology systems including those provided by vendors are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks such as hacking or viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage and other causes a suspension or termination of vendorprovided software licenses or related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected our systems or our thirdparty service providers’ systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored us mutual funds and other investment portfolios the other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us investment advisory clients outside the us account for nearly 5  of our assets under management at december 31 2015  

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations 

we remain debtfree with ample liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new product offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future we expect to continue our investment in longterm initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally 

in 2014 we made a longterm strategic decision to change our delivery of certain administrative services including fund accounting and other investment recordkeeping operations bny mellon was contracted to provide such services and 210 associates became employees of bny mellon on august 1 2015 bny mellon will transition our data to its technology platform over time though a few line items of our consolidated income statements including administrative revenues compensation and related costs and other operating expenses will be affected we do not expect that the net impact on our future operating results will be material 

background 

major us stock index returns were narrowly mixed in 2015 but it was the seventh consecutive year for a positive sp 500 index total return in the first part of the year equities benefited from steady economic and employment growth generally favorable corporate earnings outside of the energy sector and merger and acquisition activity during the summer us and global equities fell sharply in response to an unexpected devaluation of china’s currency and subsequent plunge in chinese stocks raising concerns about china’s decelerating economy and uncertainty regarding china’s leadership and policy responses us markets pared their losses in the final months of the year as global market volatility subsided amid hopes for additional stimulus measures in europe and asia even as the federal reserve prepared to raise shortterm us interest rates on december 16 2015 the us central bank raised the fed funds target rate range to 25 to 50 basis points it had been 0 to 25 basis points since december 2008 

stocks in developed nonus markets were mixed japanese stocks strongly outpaced other developed asian markets in dollar terms helped by the bank of japan’s stimulus efforts lower energy prices and increased capital spending the japanese economy narrowly avoided a recession as it grew modestly in the third quarter following a secondquarter contraction european markets rose in local currency terms but a 10 decline in the euro versus the dollar reduced returns in dollar terms eurozone inflation and economic growth remained stubbornly weak throughout the year despite the european central bank’s ecb quantitative easing program and many investors were disappointed with the ecb’s relatively mild expansion of its stimulus efforts in early december 

emerging markets equities fared poorly around the world as large resourceexporting countries brazil and russia were in recession in part because of the collapse in commodity prices and broad currency weakness versus the us dollar hurt returns in dollar terms most asian markets declined as chinese stocks fell sharply in the second half of 2015

results of several major equity market indexes for the full year 2015  are as follows 



global bond returns were mixed in 2015 in the us rising interest rates generally weighed on bond prices offsetting income treasury yields climbed for the year especially shortterm yields as the economy expanded and investors anticipated a shortterm interest rate increase from the federal reserve the 10year treasury note yield rose from 22  at the end of 2014 to 23  at the end of 2015 taxfree municipal bonds outperformed taxable bonds amid strong demand and declining issuance in the latter part of the year investmentgrade corporate bonds recorded modest losses amid heavy new issuance as companies took advantage of low interest rates high yield bonds declined as falling oil and commodity prices weighed on energy and metals and mining issuers which together represent about onefifth of the high yield sector 

bonds in developed nonus markets declined over the last year as a stronger us dollar versus other major developed market currencies especially the euro resulted in negative returns in dollar terms us dollardenominated emerging markets debt advanced modestly but significantly outperformed local currency bonds which posted steep losses as nearly all developing market currencies weakened versus the dollar plunging commodity prices expectations for rising shortterm us interest rates and countryspecific factors weighed on local currency bond performance 

results of several major bond market indexes for the full year 2015  are as follows 



assets under management 

our assets under management ended 2015  at 7631 billion  an increase  of 163 billion  from the end of 2014  market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 147 billion  and net cash inflows added 16 billion  in assets under management during 2015  

assets under management in billions at the end of the year and changes during each of the last three years are detailed below 



page  23 

    





in 2013 and 2014 the majority of the assets transferred by clients from our sponsored mutual funds to our other investment portfolios disclosed in the table above were moved from our targetdate retirement funds to our collective investment trusts and targetdate retirement trusts in 2015 assets were transferred primarily from the mutual funds to our collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts and separate accounts 

page  24 

    

the net cash inflows in our sponsored us mutual funds over the last three years were sourced primarily from thirdparty financial intermediaries across various mandates as detailed below 

in 2013 a vast majority of the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were concentrated among several large institutional clients outside the us and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives repositioned their strategy allocations or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio in 2014 the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were primarily from a few institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies in 2015 the net inflows in our other investment portfolios resulted primarily from the client transfers received from the mutual funds the net outflows prior to transfers in these portfolios in 2015 were largely concentrated among a small number of institutional clients who redeemed primarily from largecap us equity strategies 

our targetdate retirement portfolios which invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other t rowe price funds or t rowe price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings are a significant source of cash flows net cash flows after client transfers shown in the previous tables include or are net of the following net cash inflows that originated in our targetdate portfolios 



assets under management at december 31 2015  in these targetdate portfolios totaled 1657 billion  including 1355 billion  in targetdate retirement funds and 302 billion  in targetdate retirement trusts 

strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our longterm success for 2015  80  of the t rowe price us mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the threeyear  period ended december 31 2015  78  outperformed for the fiveyear  period 88  outperformed for the 10year  period and 80  outperformed for the oneyear  period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar at december 31 2015  account for nearly 86  of the assets under management in our rated funds our targetdate retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive longterm performance with at least 97  of these funds outperforming their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three five and 10year periods ended december 31 2015  the performance of the firms institutional strategies remains very competitive 

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts involve costs that precede any future revenues that we recognize from an increase to our assets under management

results of operations 



investment advisory revenues earned in 2015  increased over 2014  as average assets under our management increase d 432 billion  or 60  to 7679 billion  the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 480 basis points  in 2015  up from the 478  basis points earned in 2014  as money market fee waivers declined and equity valuations which on average carry a higher fee rate increased in 2015 we waived 476 million  in money marketrelated fees in 2015  including advisory fees and fund expenses a decrease  of 108 million  from the 584 million  waived in 2014  the fee waivers in 2015  represent 13  of total investment advisory revenues earned during the same period fees were waived from all our money market mutual funds and trusts which have combined net assets of 157 billion  at december 31 2015  we expect that these fee waivers will continue into 2016  

our operating margin in 2015  was 452  compared to 475  in the 2014  period the decline is a result of the investments we have been making to broaden and deepen our investment management distribution and service capabilities around the world despite the impact of market volatility on our net revenues we expect continued downward pressure on our operating margin in 2016 and beyond from the market effects on our net revenues and the anticipated continued investment in our capabilities 

net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us increased 73  or 1821 million  to nearly 27 billion  on higher average mutual fund assets average mutual fund assets in 2015  were 4936 billion  an increase  of 71  from the average for the comparable 2014  period 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios in 2015  were 10 billion  an increase  of 407 million  or 42  from the 9787 million  earned in the comparable 2014  period average assets in these portfolios were 2743 billion  in 2015  up   40  from the comparable 2014  period 

administrative fee revenues decrease d 122 million  to 3618 million  in 2015  the decrease  includes the reduction in certain administrative service fee rates paid by certain fund shareholders at the beginning of 2015  additionally fees earned from the mutual funds for fund accounting has declined in 2015  compared to 2014  as such services began to be performed by bny mellon in august 2015  the mutual funds have contracted directly with bny mellon to provide such services changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor class r class and variable annuity ii class shares of our sponsored portfolios were 1515 million  in 2015  an increase  of 79 million  from 2014  on greater average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated income statements 

page  26 

    

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs were 14 billion  in 2015  an increase  of 1140 million  or 86  compared to 2014  the largest part of the increase  is attributable to a 526 million   increase  in salaries and related benefits and a 430 million   increase  in our annual variable compensation program our average staff size in 2015  has increased 37  over 2014  and we employed 5999 associates at december 31 2015  higher noncash stockbased compensation expense and temporary staff expense account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2015  period the increase in compensation and related costs and our average staff size were muted by the lower compensation costs resulting from shifting 210 associates and providing ongoing transition support to bny mellon with whom we contracted to provide fund accounting and recordkeeping operations however these lower compensation costs are offset by increases in costs paid to bny mellon to provide these administrative services which are reflected in other operating expenses 

advertising and promotion costs were 797 million  in 2015  an increase  of 37 million  from 2014  the higher cost is primarily attributable to the creation and launch of a new advertising campaign and increased participation in promotional activities as we broaden our distribution reach we currently expect advertising and promotion costs for 2016  to be comparable to 2015  levels 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased   299 million  or 117  compared to 2014  the increase is primarily attributable to the added costs to update and enhance technology capabilities including related maintenance programs 

other operating expenses were 3414 million  in 2015  an increase  of 550 million  from 2014  about a third of the increase is attributable to costs being paid to bny mellon since august 2015 for the performance of certain administrative services the balance of the change is due to increased business demands and our continued investment in capabilities these costs include information and thirdparty service costs costs related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business travelrelated costs and other general and administrative costs 

nonoperating investment income 

net nonoperating investment activity during 2015  resulted in income of 1035 million  a decrease of 87 million  from 2014  net losses recognized on our sponsored fund investments of 123 million  were offset in part by other investment income of 36 million  the following table details the components of nonoperating investment income in millions during 2014  and 2015  



the net loss recognized on deconsolidation represents the reclassification of a foreign currency loss that was accumulated in other comprehensive income from the date we made our initial seed capital investment in an australian dollardenominated fund since the deconsolidation we are accounting for the investment under the equity method of accounting 

page  27 

    

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 389  in 2015  compared to 386  in 2014  we currently estimate our effective tax rate for 2016  to be about 387  our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from us and foreign sources or changes in tax rates in relevant foreign jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future 



investment advisory fees earned in   2014   were up 146 over 2013 as  average assets under our management increased 909 billion or 143 to 7247 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 478 basis points during 2014 virtually unchanged from the 477 basis points earned in 2013  in 2014 we voluntarily waived 584 million in money marketrelated fees including advisory fees and fund expenses in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors the fee waivers in 2014 were up 72 million from the 512 million waived in 2013  and represent about 2 of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2014 fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts which have combined net assets at december 31 2014 of 160 billion or 21 of our total assets under management 

greater average assets under management have increased our investment advisory revenues and helped lift our operating margin in 2014 to 475 compared to 470 in the 2013  period nonoperating investment income in 2014 includes higher gains of 358 million realized from the sale of certain of our sponsored fund holdings the proceeds from these sales were primarily used to provide additional seed capital to other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the us 

net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us were 25 billion in 2014 an increase of 169 or 3597 million on higher average mutual fund assets in 2014 average mutual fund assets were 4609 billion an increase of 178 from the 2013  average 

mutual fund assets were 4776 billion at december 31 2014 an increase of 423 billion from 4353 billion at the end of 2013  investors added net cash inflows during 2014 of 118 billion including 37 billion into our stock and blended asset funds and 83 billion into our bond funds the money market funds had net outflows of 2 billion these cash flow amounts are presented net of 53 billion that clients transferred to the other investment portfolios primarily our collective investment trusts and targetdate retirement trusts without these transfers the mutual funds would have had net cash inflows of 171 billion in 2014 market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 305 billion to our mutual fund assets under management in 2014 

  

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 822 million or 92 to 9787 million average assets in these portfolios were 2638 billion during 2014 an increase of 212 billion or 87 from the 2013  year assets in these portfolios at december 31 2014 were 2692 billion an increase of 121 billion from the end of 2013  market appreciation and income of 202 billion was partially offset by net outflows of 81 billion during 2014 net outflows during 2014 are presented net of the 53 billion assets that clients transferred in from the mutual funds these net outflows were primarily from a few number of institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies 

page  28 

    

administrative fees increased 303 million to 3740 million in 2014 the increase is primarily attributable to increased costs incurred to provide fund accounting services and transfer agent servicing activities to the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor class r class and variable annuity ii class shares of our sponsored portfolios were 1436 million in 2014 an increase of 264 million from the comparable 2013  period on greater average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of our consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs increased 149 from 2013  to about 13 billion a significant part of the increase is attributable to a 607 million increase in our annual variable compensation program and a 608 million increase in salaries and related benefits which result from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2014 combined with a 48 increase in our average staff size over the 2013  period we continue to increase our staff size to support both business growth and added capabilities higher temporary staff expenses noncash stockbased compensation expense and other employee costs account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2014 period at december 31 2014 we employed 5870 associates an increase of 36 from the end of 2013  

advertising and promotion expenditures were 760 million in 2014 a decrease of 110 million from the 2013  period the decrease in cost from the 2013  period is primarily a result of repurposing this spending to other distribution activities 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 292 million or 129 versus 2013  nearly half of the increase is attributable to the opening of two new buildings at our owings mills campus in the fourth quarter of 2013  and the renovation of certain existing facilities the increase also includes the added costs to update and enhance our technology capabilities including related maintenance programs these increases were offset by the nonrecurrence of the 35 million in costs recognized to terminate certain facility leases in 2013 

other operating expenses were 2864 million in 2014 an increase of 271 million from the comparable 2013  period as higher business demands and our continued investment in our capabilities have increased our costs these increased costs include those related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business information and other thirdparty service costs travel costs and other general and administrative costs 

nonoperating investment income 

our nonoperating investment income which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses was up 492 million from the 2013  period the increase is due in part to the 2014 results including 493 million in gains realized on the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings compared with 135 million in gains realized in the comparable 2013  period larger yearend dividends including capital gain distributions earned from our mutual fund investments of 218 million were offset in part by a decrease in net investment gains recognized on certain of our other investments in the 2014 period the 2013  year also included a 15 million gain recognized on the sale of our savings bank subsidiary 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 386 in 2014 compared to 384 in 2013 our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from us and foreign sources or changes in tax rates in relevant foreign jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2015  stockholders’ equity decrease d from 54 billion  to 48 billion  which results primarily from us expending 9878 million  to repurchase 131 million  common shares in 2015 additionally we paid 208  per share in regular dividends and paid a 200 special dividend in 2015  our repurchases and dividends were expended using existing cash balances and cash generated from operations we generally repurchase shares of our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans 

as detailed below we have returned 33 billion to stockholders over the last three years through stock repurchases our regular quarterly dividends and one special dividend 



tangible book value is 41 billion  at december 31 2015  and our cash and fund investment holdings total 28 billion  the cash and fund investment holdings held by our foreign subsidiaries is 4 billion at december 31 2015  given the availability of these financial resources we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity 

at december 31 2015  we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling 482 million  to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment these outstanding commitments if called will be funded from operating resources we currently expect total capital expenditures for facilities equipment and technology development for 2016  to be up to 180 million  which will be funded from operating resources 

2015  versus 2014  

operating activities during 2015  provided cash flows of 15 billion  up 2151 million  from the 2014  period we used 750 million  less cash in 2015  compared with the 2014  period as we seeded fewer new sponsored investment portfolios higher noncash depreciation and amortization and noncash stockbased compensation in 2015 increased cash flows by 302 million  timing differences on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities increased our operating cash flows by 1148 million  compared to 2014  more than half of the timing difference on the cash settlement of our assets and liabilities is related to bonus compensation that was deferred by certain employees under the new supplemental savings plan that went into effect in 2015 the supplemental savings plan provides certain senior officers the opportunity to defer any portion of their cash incentive compensation earned for a respective calendar year during which services are provided for a period of two or more years 

net cash provided by investing activities totaled 1090 million  in 2015  compared with net cash used of 4434 million  in the comparable 2014  period in 2015 cash proceeds from the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings net of new investments resulted in investing cash flows of 2697 million  this compares with net investments of 3053 million  that we made into our sponsored fund investments in 2014  we increased our property and equipment additions by 251 million  during 2015  compared to the 2014  period 

net cash used in financing activities was 19492 million  in 2015  up 12094 million  from the comparable 2014  period the payment of a 200 special dividend on april 23 2015 and an 18 increase in our regular quarterly pershare dividend accounted for 5969 million  of the increase from 2014  we also increased our common stock repurchases by 5723 million  during 2015  compared with 2014  

page  30 

    

2014  versus 2013  

operating activities during 2014 provided cash flows of nearly 13 billion up 581 million from the 2013 period higher net income noncash depreciation and amortization and noncash stockbased compensation in the 2014 period increased cash flows in aggregate 2218 million over the 2013 levels this aggregate increase was offset by 645 million in more cash used in 2014 to seed new sponsored investment portfolios that we are consolidating and treating their underlying investment holdings as trading securities timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues payables and accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities also decreased our operating cash flows by 692 million compared to the 2013 year our 2014 operating cash flows were also increased by 358 million in higher gains realized from the sale of certain availableforsale sponsored fund investments as the related proceeds are reflected as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4434 million an increase of 59 million from 2013 we increased our capital expenditures and other investments activity in 2014 by 204 million and 121 million respectively these increases in net cash used were more than offset by 352 million in less net cash invested in our sponsored funds as we sold more existing investments to fund the new investments in 2014 compared to the 2013 period the 2013 year also included 86 million in net cash proceeds related to our savings bank subsidiary and its sale in december 2013 

net cash used in financing activities was 7398 million in 2014 up 4630 million from the comparable 2013 period we increased our common stock repurchases by 4014 million in 2014 compared with the 2013 period cash used for dividends paid in 2014 increased 654 million due primarily to the 16 increase in our pershare dividend rate 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2015  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2016  and future years the information also excludes the 58 million  of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 



we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 482 million  at december 31 2015  the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

page  31 

    

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2015  annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

otherthantemporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds as availableforsale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest nor exercise significant influence over its operating and financial policies at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

in determining whether a mutual fund holding is otherthantemporarily impaired we consider many factors including the duration of time the impairment has existed the severity of the impairment any subsequent changes in value and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value subject to the other considerations noted above we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an otherthantemporary impairment we may also recognize an otherthantemporary impairment for losses that have existed for less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments  we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit – our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million  

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair valuebased method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes optionpricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair valuebased method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined

newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance 

in may 2014 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201409 — revenue from contracts with customers the objective of the new standard is to provide a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers to improve comparability within industries across industries and across capital markets the revenue standard contains principles that will be applied to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized in august 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201514 which defers the effective date of the standard by one year and permits early adoption we would be required to adopt the new standard on january 1 2018 we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations 

in february 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201502 — consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis this standard modifies existing consolidation guidance for reporting companies that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities asu 201502 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 and requires either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adoption we will adopt the asu on january 1 2016 using the modified retrospective transition method the adoption of this new guidance will increase the number of sponsored fund investments that we consolidate either because we own the majority of the voting interest of those us mutual funds or are considered the primary beneficiary of those investment vehicles outside the us that will be required to be analyzed as variable interest entities as a result the underlying assets and liabilities of the consolidated funds will be included in our consolidated balance sheet and we will recognize redeemable noncontrolling interest for the portion of the consolidated funds that are owned by a thirdparty investor additionally the change in fair value of the consolidated funds net of taxes will begin to be recognized in net income instead of other comprehensive income as they will no longer be accounted for as availableforsale investments we are evaluating the effect asu 201502 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

in january 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201601 — financial instruments—overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities the amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2017 and requires a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption early adoption is not permitted the new guidance will require the change in fair value of equity investments with readily determinable fair values to be recognized through the income statements we are currently evaluating the full impact of the standard however upon adoption the change in the fair value of our availableforsale equity investments will be recognized in our consolidated income statement instead of accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 

we have considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements including that which we have not yet adopted we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as 

page  33 

    

compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any otherthantemporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investee’s net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the us and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the us variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option and other equity grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities or under the equity method by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of fund shares we have chosen to use a variant of each funds net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each funds net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each funds investment objective the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of these fund investments at yearend was determined by using the lower of each fund’s lowest net asset value per share during 2015  or its net asset value per share at december 31 2015  reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all funds experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  



for availableforsale securities we experienced actual net unrealized losses  of 50 million  in 2015 that are considered temporary in other comprehensive income we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating investment income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary during 2015  we recognized an otherthantemporary impairment of 48 million 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate

our equity method investment in uti of 1328 million  at december 31 2015  exposes us to foreign currency risk related to translating our proportionate share of its financial statements which are denominated in indian rupees inr to us dollars usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this foreign currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss  net of tax of 314 million  at december 31 2015  related to our investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several foreign countries of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in usd we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

business 

tableend 

t rowe price group inc is a financial services holding company that provides global investment management services through its subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and other investment portfolios these other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the united states and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us 

the late thomas rowe price jr founded our firm in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates inc was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000 

we derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenue and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries primarily t rowe price associates and t rowe price international ltd our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations at december 31 2014  we had 7468 billion  in assets under management including 4776 billion  in the price funds and 2692 billion  in other investment portfolios 

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base across four primary distribution channels thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and other countries individual us investors on a direct basis us defined contribution retirement plans and institutional investors globally as of december 31 2014  nearly fortyfive percent  of our assets under management are sourced from our thirdparty financial intermediary distribution channel with the remaining three distribution channels comprising the balance we have taken steps to broaden and deepen our distribution reach in overseas markets and with financial intermediaries these initiatives are part of multiyear plans designed to further diversify our assets under management and client base in 2014 we made key hires and continued to make investments in infrastructure to support these initiatives over the longterm 

the assets we manage are a broad range of us and international stock blended asset bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investors select mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus and can exchange balances among the funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change the investment objectives and investment management approaches employed in our other investment portfolios are similar to those in the price funds we also offer specialized advisory services including management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global multiregional and regional international emerging market and sector investing our fixed income strategies may focus on high yield us taxable bond taxable lowduration international and municipal taxfree investing we also combine strategies across asset classes to create solutions that help our clients achieve a single investment objective to this end we offer systematic taxefficient blended equity and asset allocation investment strategies including targetdate retirement investment portfolios 

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the us and england with additional staff based in australia hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment 

page  2 

management expertise and that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period since the beginning of 2014 we have launched three new equity products—asia opportunities frontier markets and international concentrated equity—and three new fixed income products—dynamic global bond credit opportunities and intermediate tax free high yield two additional fixed income products were opened in january 2015 we typically provide seed capital for the new investment portfolio to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets the length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment portfolio as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the portfolio from unrelated investors we attempt to ensure that the new investment portfolio has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment portfolios net asset value or its investment performance record at december 31 2014 approximately 39  of our investments in sponsored portfolios and other investments is considered seed investments 

conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund or investment strategy in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing fund shareholders and investors at present the following mutual funds and affiliated other investment portfolios are closed to new investors 



we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting distribution and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the t rowe price complex brokerage and trust services substantially all of our administrative and distribution and servicing fee revenues in 2014  were determined based generally on the recovery of our related costs to provide these services therefore changes in our administrative fees distribution and servicing fees and related expenses generally do not significantly affect our net operating income or net income 

in 2014 we made a longterm strategic decision to change our delivery of certain administrative services including fund accounting and other investment recordkeeping operations we are currently in negotiations with bny mellon to perform these services if a formal agreement is reached we do not expect that the impact on our future operating results will be material 

2014  developments 

us equities as measured by the sp 500 index rose in 2014 for the sixth consecutive year the sp 500 index and the nasdaq composite index which is heavily weighted in technology companies returned 137  and 134  respectively in 2014 equities in developed nonus markets declined in dollar terms in 2014  as a stronger us dollar versus other currencies reduced overseas returns to us investors emerging markets equities in aggregate declined in dollar terms but held up better than developed nonus markets global bonds produced mostly positive returns in 2014

six price funds  growth stock  equity income  midcap growth  bluechip growth  value  and capital appreciation   accounted for 27  of our investment advisory revenues in 2014  and 23  of our assets under management at december 31 

page  3 

2014  our largest client account relationship apart from the price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 4  of our investment advisory revenues in 2014  

assets under management ended 2014  at a record 7468 billion  an increase  of 544 billion  from the end of 2013  market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 507 billion  and net cash inflows added 37 billion  in assets under management during 2014  net cash inflows of 118 billion  into the price funds were partially offset by net cash outflows of 81 billion  from our other investment portfolios these net cash outflows were primarily from a few institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies the mutual fund and other investment portfolio 2014 cash flow amounts are each presented net of 53 billion in assets clients transferred from the mutual funds to other sponsored investment portfolios during the year primarily our targetdate retirement trusts 

our targetdate retirement funds and trusts which provide shareholders with single diversified portfolios that invest in underlying t rowe price funds and t rowe price collective investment trusts continue to be a significant source of our asset growth in 2014  our net cash flows include 177 billion  that originated in these portfolios including 132 billion in our targetdate retirement funds 

details of our assets under management in billions at december 31 2014  are as follows 

  



our targetdate retirement portfolios account for 199  of our managed assets at december 31 2014  compared with 175  at the end of 2013  the assets under management in these portfolios totaled 1485 billion  at december 31 2014  including 1260 billion  in targetdate retirement funds and 225 billion  in targetdate retirement trusts 

nonus dollar denominated securities held in client accounts are 1007 billion  or 135  of our total assets under management at december 31 2014  investors domiciled outside the us represent 56  of total assets under management at the end of 2014  we service clients in 36  countries around the world 

investment performance 

strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our longterm success as of the end of 2014  74  of the t rowe price us mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the threeyear  period 80  outperformed for the fiveyear  period 88  outperformed for the 10year  period and 73  outperformed for the oneyear  period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar at december 31 2014  account for 82  of the assets 

page  4 

under management in our rated funds the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks was substantially similar our targetdate retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive longterm performance with 100  of these funds outperforming their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three and fiveyear periods ended december 31 2014  

capital resources 

at december 31 2014  we remain debtfree with substantial liquidity and resources including cash and fund investment holdings of 34 billion  during the full year of 2014  we expended 4155 million to repurchase 53 million shares of common stock we generally repurchase shares of our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans we presently plan to declare and pay quarterly cash dividends in 2015  that taken together will exceed the 176  per share in annual regular dividends declared and paid in 2014  however there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at increasing rates or at all 

we also invested 126 million during the year in capitalized technology and facilities from existing cash balances we currently expect total capital expenditures for facilities equipment and technology development for 2015  to be up to 175 million  which will be funded from operating resources 

our substantial liquidity and resources also allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new investment strategy offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future in the coming years we expect to increase funding for longterm initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally 

additional information concerning our revenues results of operations and total assets and our assets under management during the past three years is contained in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10k as well as our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this report 

price funds 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

advisory services 

investment advisory revenues earned from the price funds are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate details of each funds fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

for the majority of the price funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the price funds if the combined net assets of these price funds exceed 400 billion  the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 295 basis points  for the first 400 billion  of net assets plus 275 basis points  for net assets in excess of 400 billion  to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds including the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion the new income and value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 20 on net assets in excess of 20 billion the effective fee rates for the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of at least 60 million  in 2014  varied 

page  5 

from a low of 39  basis points for the maryland taxfree bond taxfree shortintermediate and shortterm bond funds to a high of 104  basis points for the emerging markets stock international discovery and latin america funds 

the fee rate of several of the price funds including the index and summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors do not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds that we offer invests in a diversified portfolio of other price funds and has no separate investment advisory fee rather they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured 

in 2014  we continued to voluntarily waive advisory fees and other fund expenses of all of our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain a positive yield for investors total fees waived in 2014 were 584 million  or about 2  of total investment advisory revenues earned during the year compared to 512 million  in 2013  we expect that these fee waivers will continue in 2015  

assets under management 

at december 31 2014  assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 4776 billion  an increase of 97  or 423 billion  from the beginning of the year the following table presents the net assets in billions and the year of formation of our largest price funds net assets in excess of 10 billion  at december 31 2014  at december 31

administrative services 

our subsidiaries provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds and their shareholders t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in both the price funds and funds outside the price fund complex plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the price funds 

we provide trustee services through our subsidiary t rowe price trust company a marylandchartered limited service trust company through this entity we offer collective investment trusts for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans 

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals 

distribution and servicing 

the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the us on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and fixed income portfolios 

certain of the price funds also offer advisor class and r class shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes pay 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the price funds and enters into a triparty agreement with each intermediary and fund under the agreement each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries in addition those price funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statements of income we also recognize as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statements of income the corresponding cost paid to the thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these fund share classes the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including the enhancement of our digital capabilities

our other client investment portfolios had assets under management of 2692 billion  at december 31 2014  an increase of 121 billion  from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us at december 31 the assets under management in these portfolios included the following investment mandates 



we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations monthend average valuations or end of billing period valuations in 2014  approximately 69  of advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 13  were based on monthend averages and 18  were based on end of billing period valuations 

our subsidiaries t rowe price luxembourg management sàrl and t rowe price international provide management company and investment management services respectively to our luxembourgbased sicavs société dinvestissement à capital variable and fcps fonds commun de placement these funds are distributed outside the us through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries the fees earned for these distribution and marketing services are part of the overall investment management fees earned for managing the sicav and fcp fund assets we recognize any related distribution fees paid to financial intermediaries in other operating expenses at december 31 2014 assets under management in these funds were 112 billion

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies hedge funds and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship

risk factors 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased funds and portfolios at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

page  11 

the performance of our money market funds and portfolios are impacted by the historically low interest rate environment 

our money market funds and portfolios performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund when interest rates are at or near the historic lows the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolios net income thereby reducing the yield of the funds to very low levels since the second half of 2009 such an environment has led us to voluntarily waive our advisory and other fees earned on our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain yields at or above 0 for fund investors such actions reduce our advisory fee income and net income the actual amount of fees waived is dependent on a number of variables including among others changes in the net assets held by our money market funds changes in market yields changes in the expense levels of the funds and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers also bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds could experience significant redemptions which could decrease our revenues and net income for further discussion of the fees we waived in the current period managements expectation as to future fee waivers and the net cash flows of our money market funds and trusts please see our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10k 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance fees and related expenses and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income in the event that we were to decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

page  12 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel we have near and longterm succession planning processes including programs to develop our future leaders which are intended to address future talent needs and minimize the impact of losing key talent however in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse effect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties litigation and a decrease in revenues 

operating risks include 

 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if those inquiries are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

 

page  13 

 

under our agreements with the t rowe price mutual funds we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any of our sponsored investment products any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios in the us and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of investment product offerings and successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region and in london england we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in sponsored stock blended asset and bond funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments 

page  14 

in the case of our availableforsale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to our sponsored investment portfolios that are held as trading and accounted for under the equity method in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position 

any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping additional or new regulatory requirements operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 26 investment in uti asset management company ltd uti an indian asset management company and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us and have an equity investment in uti our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or other indirect effects on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

 

 

page  15 

since retirement plans are a significant part of our client base and other types of retirement accounts invest in our mutual funds in addition changes to the current framework may impact our business in other ways for example proposals to reduce contributions to individual retirement accounts and defined contribution plans for certain individuals as well as potential changes to defined benefit plans may result in increased plan terminations and reduce our opportunity to manage and service retirement assets 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

page  16 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase in litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure to conduct or expand our operations or if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

all of our technology systems including those provided by vendors are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks such as hacking or viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage and other causes a suspension or termination of vendorprovided software licenses or related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected our systems or our thirdparty service providers’ systems

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored us mutual funds and other investment portfolios the other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us investment advisory clients outside the us account for 56  of our assets under management at december 31 2014  

page  21 

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations 

we remain debtfree with substantial liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new fund offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future we expect to continue our investment in longterm initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent add investment capabilities both in terms of new strategies and new investment vehicles expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally 

background 

us equities as measured by the sp 500 index rose in 2014 for the sixth consecutive year as the economy rebounded strongly from a firstquarter weatherrelated contraction although economic growth faltered overseas and geopolitical tensions increased because of russia’s actions involving ukraine and international sanctions the us market was supported by falling longterm interest rates favorable corporate earnings and expanded stimulus efforts in the eurozone and japan also tumbling oil prices in the second half of the year though unfavorable for the energy sector were seen as a generally positive factor for the us 

equities in developed nonus markets declined in dollar terms in 2014 as a stronger us dollar versus other currencies reduced overseas returns to us investors asian markets generally held up better than european markets in japan the economy entered recession following an april 1 2014 sales tax increase that caused consumers and businesses to significantly curtail spending the eurozone struggled with low inflation high unemployment and a loss of consumer and business confidence 

emerging markets equities in aggregate declined in dollar terms but held up better than developed nonus markets developing asian markets performed best with many markets in the region producing strong returns latin american markets mostly declined emerging european markets underperformed amid severe weakness in russia whose currency plunged 45 

results of several major equity market indexes for the full year 2014  are as follows 



global bonds produced mostly positive returns in 2014 in the us lowerquality corporate bonds underperformed investmentgrade issues for the year and declined in the second half of the year because of weakness in the energy sector the largest segment of the high yield market investmentgrade issues produced good results led by longterm treasury securities amid strong demand for relatively highyielding safehaven government debt longterm interest rates declined despite the federal reserve’s reduction of monthly asset purchases and conclusion of such purchases in october the 10year treasury note yield finished 2014  at 22  versus 30  at the end of 2013  

government bonds in developed nonus markets produced moderate losses in us dollar terms as the stronger dollar more than offset localcurrency gains stemming from declining yields in key government bond markets emerging markets bonds performed well amid persistent demand for higheryielding assets and as concerns about the impact of fed tapering on global liquidity diminished as the year progressed dollardenominated emerging markets bonds performed better than localcurrency issues

assets under management 

reflecting the strong growth in equity markets our assets under management ended 2014  at a record 7468 billion  an increase  of 544 billion  from the end of 2013  market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 507 billion  and net cash inflows added 37 billion  in assets under management during 2014  

assets under management in billions at the end of the year and changes during each of the last three years are detailed below 







the net cash inflows in our sponsored us mutual funds over the last three years were sourced primarily from thirdparty financial intermediaries in 2013 a vast majority of the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were concentrated 

page  23 

among several large institutional clients outside the us and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives repositioned their strategy allocations or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio in 2014 the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were primarily from a few institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies 

the majority of the assets transferred by clients from our sponsored mutual funds to our other investment portfolios disclosed in the previous table were moved from our targetdate retirement funds to our collective investment trusts and targetdate retirement trusts 

our targetdate retirement funds and trusts which invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other t rowe price funds and t rowe price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings are a significant source of cash flows net cash flows shown in the previous table include or are net of the following net cash inflows that originated in our targetdate portfolios 



assets under management at december 31 2014  in these targetdate portfolios totaled 1485 billion  including 1260 billion  in targetdate retirement funds and 225 billion  in targetdate retirement trusts 

strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our longterm success for 2014  74  of the t rowe price us mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the threeyear  period ended december 31 2014  80  outperformed for the fiveyear  period 88  outperformed for the 10year  period and 73  outperformed for the oneyear  period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar at december 31 2014  account for 82  of the assets under management in our rated funds the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks was substantially similar our targetdate retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive longterm performance with 100  of these funds outperforming their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three and fiveyear periods ended december 31 2014  

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management

2014  versus 2013  



page  24 

investment advisory fees earned in   2014   are up   146   over   2013   as  average assets under our management increase d 909 billion  or 143  to 7247 billion  the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 478  basis points during 2014  virtually unchanged from the 477  basis points earned in 2013  in 2014  we voluntarily waived 584 million  in money marketrelated fees including advisory fees and fund expenses in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors the fee waivers in 2014  were up   72 million  from the 512 million  waived in 2013  and represent about 2  of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2014  fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts which have combined net assets at december 31 2014  of 160 billion  or 21  of our total assets under management we expect that these fee waivers will continue in 2015  

greater average assets under management have increased our investment advisory revenues and helped lift our operating margin in 2014  to 475  compared to 470  in the 2013  period nonoperating investment income in 2014  includes higher gains of 358 million  realized from the sale of certain of our sponsored fund holdings the proceeds from these sales were primarily used to provide additional seed capital to other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the us 

net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us were 25 billion  in 2014  an increase  of 169  or 3597 million  on higher average mutual fund assets in 2014  average mutual fund assets were 4609 billion  an increase  of 178  from the 2013  average 

mutual fund assets were 4776 billion  at december 31 2014  an increase of 423 billion  from 4353 billion  at the end of 2013  investors added net cash inflows  during 2014  of 118 billion  including 37 billion  into our stock and blended asset funds and 83 billion  into our bond funds the money market funds had net outflows of 2 billion  these cash flow amounts are presented net of 53 billion  that clients transferred to the other investment portfolios primarily our collective investment trusts and targetdate retirement trusts without these transfers the mutual funds would have had net cash inflows of 171 billion  in 2014  market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 305 billion  to our mutual fund assets under management in 2014  

  

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increase d 822 million  or 92  to 9787 million  average assets in these portfolios were 2638 billion  during 2014  an increase  of 212 billion  or 87  from the 2013  year assets in these portfolios at december 31 2014  were 2692 billion  an increase  of 121 billion  from the end of 2013  market appreciation and income  of 202 billion  was partially offset by net outflows  of 81 billion  during 2014  net outflows during 2014  are presented net of the 53 billion  assets that clients transferred in from the mutual funds these net outflows were primarily from a few number of institutional and subadvisory clients who redeemed significant amounts from a small number of equity and fixed income strategies 

administrative fees increase d 303 million  to 3740 million  in 2014  the increase  is primarily attributable to increased costs incurred to provide fund accounting services and transfer agent servicing activities to the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor class r class and variable annuity class shares of our sponsored portfolios were 1436 million  in 2014  an increase of 264 million  from the comparable 2013  period on greater average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of our consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs increase d 149  from 2013  to about 13 billion  a significant part of the increase  is attributable to a 607 million   increase  in our annual variable compensation program and a 608 million   increase  in salaries and related benefits which result from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2014 combined with a 48  increase in our average staff size over the 2013  period we continue to increase our staff size to support both business growth and added capabilities higher temporary staff expenses noncash stockbased compensation expense and other employee costs account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2014  period at december 31 2014  we employed 5870  associates an increase  of 36  from the end of 2013  

advertising and promotion expenditures were 760 million  in 2014  a decrease of 110 million  from the 2013  period the decrease in cost from the 2013  period is primarily a result of repurposing this spending to other distribution activities we 

page  25 

currently expect that advertising and promotion costs for the first quarter of 2015  to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2014  and the full year 2015 costs could increase about 5 from 2014 levels 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increase d 292 million  or 129  versus 2013  nearly half of the increase is attributable to the opening of two new buildings at our owings mills campus in the fourth quarter of 2013  and the renovation of certain existing facilities the increase also includes the added costs to update and enhance our technology capabilities including related maintenance programs these increases were offset by the nonrecurrence of the 35 million in costs recognized to terminate certain facility leases in 2013 

other operating expenses were 2864 million  in 2014  an increase  of 271 million  from the comparable 2013  period as higher business demands and our continued investment in our capabilities have increased our costs these increased costs include those related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business information and other thirdparty service costs travel costs and other general and administrative costs 

nonoperating investment income 

our nonoperating investment income which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses was up   492 million  from the 2013  period the increase is due in part to the 2014  results including 493 million  in gains realized on the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings compared with 135 million  in gains realized in the comparable 2013  period larger yearend dividends including capital gain distributions earned from our mutual fund investments of 218 million  were offset in part by a decrease in net investment gains recognized on certain of our other investments in the 2014 period the 2013  year also included a 15 million gain recognized on the sale of our savings bank subsidiary 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate was 386  in 2014  compared to 384  in 2013  we currently estimate our effective tax rate for 2015  will be about 385  our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our foreign subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from us and foreign sources or changes in tax rates in relevant foreign jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future 

2013  versus 2012  

investment advisory fees in 2013 are up over 2012 as  average assets under our management increased 844 billion to 6338 billion for the 2013 year in addition the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management increased to 477 basis points during 2013 from the 472 basis points earned in 2012 due primarily to asset growth in higher than average fee rate strategies we voluntarily waived 512 million in money market advisory fees in 2013 an increase of 162 million from the 350 million waived in 2012 in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors these fee waivers represent about 2 of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2013 fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts that have combined net assets at december 31 2013 of 163 billion or 24 of our total assets under management 

greater average assets under management and a higher annualized fee rate have increased our investment advisory revenues and helped lift our operating margin in 2013 to 470 compared to 451 in the 2012 period nonoperating investment income in 2013 is down compared to 2012 primarily because we sold fewer sponsored fund holdings in 2013 resulting in lower realized gains 

net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us were 21 billion in 2013 an increase of 188 or 3358 million on higher average mutual fund assets average mutual fund assets in 2013 were 3912 billion an increase of 198 from the 2012 average mutual fund assets at december 31 2013 were 4353 billion up 884 billion from the end of 2012 

net inflows into the mutual funds during 2013 were 102 billion including 58 billion into our stock and blended asset funds 35 billion into our bond funds and 9 billion into the money market funds these mutual fund net inflow amounts are presented net of 77 billion that clients transferred to the other investment portfolios primarily our collective investment trusts and targetdate retirement trusts without these transfers the mutual funds would have had net cash inflows of 179 billion in 2013 market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 782 billion to our mutual fund assets under management in 2013 

page  26 

  

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 948 million or 118 to 8965 million average assets in these portfolios were 2426 billion during 2013 an increase of 198 billion or 89 from the 2012 year ending assets at december 31 2013 were 2571 billion an increase of 272 billion from the end of 2012 market appreciation and income of 494 billion was reduced by net outflows of 222 billion during 2013 net outflows during 2013 are presented net of the 77 billion assets that clients transferred in from the mutual funds the vast majority of these net outflows were concentrated among several large institutional clients outside the us and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives repositioned their strategy allocations or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio 

administrative fees increased 111 million to 3437 million in 2013 the increase is primarily attributable to our transfer agent servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor class r class and variable annuity class shares of our sponsored portfolios were 1172 million in 2013 an increase of 211 million from the comparable 2012 period on greater average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of our consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs increased 104 from 2012 to about 12 billion a significant part of the increase is attributable to a 454 million increase in our annual variable compensation program and a 372 million increase in salaries and related benefits we increased our average staff size by 41 over 2012 to support both business growth and added capabilities higher temporary staff expenses noncash stockbased compensation expense and other employee costs account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2013 period at december 31 2013 we employed 5668 associates an increase of 55 from the end of 2012 

advertising and promotion expenditures were 870 million in 2013 compared to 885 million in 2012 the decrease in cost from the 2012 period is primarily attributable to process efficiencies realized through the realignment of certain marketing activities 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 208 million or 101 versus 2012 the increase in costs is largely attributable to the expansion of our international facilities the opening of two new buildings located at our owings mills campus and continued investment in our technology capabilities including related maintenance programs the 2013 year also includes a nonrecurring charge of 35 million related to the termination of certain facility leases 

other operating expenses were 2593 million in 2013 an increase of 389 million from the comparable 2012 period as increased business demands and our continued investment in our capabilities have increased our costs these costs include consulting and professional fees costs related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business information services and other thirdparty services we also made a higher charitable contribution to the t rowe price foundation in 2013 than in 2012 

nonoperating investment income 

our nonoperating investment income which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses was down 78 million from the 2012 period the decrease is due in part to the 2013 results including 135 million in gains realized on the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings compared with 351 million in gains realized in the comparable 2012 period this reduction in realized gains was partially offset by 79 million in higher dividends received on our sponsored mutual fund holdings and 56 million in higher gains recognized on our other investments the 2013 year also includes a 15 million gain recognized on the sale of our savings bank subsidiary 

provision for income taxes 

our 2013 effective tax rate of 384 is unchanged from the 2012 rate our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our nonus subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from us and nonus sources or changes in tax rates in relevant nonus jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2014  stockholders’ equity increase d from 48 billion  to 54 billion  in 2014  we paid 176  per share in regular dividends and expended 4155 million  to repurchase 5312663  common shares from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations we generally repurchase shares of our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans tangible book value is 47 billion  at december 31 2014  and our cash and fund investment holdings total 34 billion  given the availability of these financial resources we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity 

at december 31 2014  we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling 366 million  to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment these outstanding commitments if called will be funded from operating resources we currently expect total capital expenditures for facilities equipment and technology development for 2015  to be up to 175 million  which will be funded from operating resources 

2014  versus 2013  

operating activities during 2014  provided cash flows of nearly 13 billion  up   581 million  from the 2013  period higher net income noncash depreciation and amortization and noncash stockbased compensation in the 2014 period increased cash flows in aggregate 2218 million  over the 2013 levels this aggregate increase was offset by 645 million  in more cash used in 2014 to seed new sponsored investment portfolios that we are consolidating and treating their underlying investment holdings as trading securities timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues payables and accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities also decrease d our operating cash flows by 692 million  compared to the 2013  year our 2014  operating cash flows were also increased by 358 million  in higher gains realized from the sale of certain availableforsale sponsored fund investments as the related proceeds are reflected as an investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4434 million  an increase  of 59 million  from 2013  we increased our capital expenditures and other investments activity in 2014  by 204 million  and 121 million respectively these increases in net cash used were more than offset by 352 million  in less net cash invested in our sponsored funds as we sold more existing investments to fund the new investments in 2014  compared to the 2013  period the 2013  year also included 86 million in net cash proceeds related to our savings bank subsidiary and its sale in december 2013 

net cash used in financing activities was 7398 million  in 2014  up   4630 million  from the comparable 2013  period we increased our common stock repurchases by 4014 million  in 2014 compared with the 2013 period cash used for dividends paid in 2014 increased 654 million  due primarily to the 16 increase in our pershare dividend rate 

2013  versus 2012  

operating activities during 2013 provided cash flows of 12 billion up 3304 million from the 2012 period including a 1641 million increase in net income timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues payables and accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities increased our operating cash flows by 624 million compared to the 2012 year the increase from 2012 is also a result of a 637 million reduction in cash used to make net purchases of trading securities held by our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and a 216 million reduction in the adjustment for gains realized from the sale of certain availableforsale sponsored fund investments as less investments were sold in 2013 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4375 million up 1274 million from 2012 we made 601 million more net investments in our sponsored funds during 2013 compared with 2012 as we utilized more of our cash to make additional investments as compared to the rebalancing of the portfolio in 2012 the 2012 year also included greater net cash proceeds of 401 million from the sale of debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary as the bank was sold in early december 2013 we spent 289 million more in property and equipment additions in 2013 compared to the 2012 period the 2013 year also includes a net cash outflow of 117 million related to the sale of our savings bank subsidiary as the cash that was held by the bank on the closing date was greater than the 236 million in proceeds we received 

net cash used in financing activities was 2768 million in 2013 down 3347 million from the comparable 2012 period the decrease is primarily attributable to the repurchase of 21 million more shares of common stock and the payment of a 100 special dividend in 2012 

page  28 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2014  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2015  and future years the information also excludes the 56 million  of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 



we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 366 million  at december 31 2014  the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2014  annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

otherthantemporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds as availableforsale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

in determining whether a mutual fund holding is otherthantemporarily impaired we consider many factors including the duration of time the impairment has existed the severity of the impairment any subsequent changes in value and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value subject to the other considerations noted above we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an otherthantemporary impairment we may also recognize an otherthantemporary impairment for losses that have existed for less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments  we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

page  29 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit – our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million  

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value based method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes optionpricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of fund shares we have chosen to use a variant of each funds net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each funds net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each funds investment objective the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of our fund investments at yearend was determined by using the lower of each fund’s lowest net asset value per share during 2014  or its net asset value per share at december 31 2014  reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all funds experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  

page  31 



the comparable potential loss of value in 2013  using the same methodology noted above was 2471 million  or 15 on sponsored fund investments of 16119 million  during 2014  we experienced actual net unrealized losses of 21 million  

  

as availableforsale securities we recognize unrealized losses that are considered temporary in other comprehensive income we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating investment income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

we hold 1256 million at december 31 2014 in equity method investments related to seed capital investments we have in sponsored funds in which we are deemed to have significant influence given that the funds net assets are at fair value we utilized the same methodology to quantify the impact of equity risk on our carrying value as we did for our availableforsale portfolio as further discussed above the potential loss in value before any income tax benefits of our equity method investments in sponsored funds was 126 million 

our equity method investment in uti of 1324 million  at december 31 2014 exposes us to foreign currency risk related to translating our proportionate share of its financial statements which are denominated in indian rupees inr to us dollars usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this foreign currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss  net of tax of 257 million at december 31 2014  related to our investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several foreign countries of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in usd we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

our 2013 results include net revenues of nearly 35 billion  net income of 105 billion  and diluted earnings per share of 390  an increase of 161  from the 336  per share earned in 2012  assets under management ended 2013  at a record 6924 billion  an increase of 1156 billion  from the end of 2012  market appreciation drove this increase as 1276 billion  in market gains and income net of distributions not reinvested were reduced by net cash outflows of 120 billion  in the year net cash inflows of 102 billion  into the price funds were more than offset by net cash outflows of 222 billion  from our other investment portfolios the vast majority of these net outflows from our other investment portfolios were concentrated among several large institutional clients outside the us and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives repositioned their strategy allocations or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio a large portion of the outflows were from one international institutional client

our assets under management in billions at december 31 2013  categorized by mandate and account type are as follows 

  



nonus dollar denominated securities held in client accounts are 963 billion  or 139  of our total assets under management at december 31 2013  investors domiciled outside the us represent 65  of total assets under management at the end of 2013  

our targetdate retirement portfolios which provide shareholders with single diversified portfolios that invest in underlying price funds and other investment portfolios continue to be a significant source of our asset growth in 2013 115 billion  of our net cash flows originated in these portfolios assets under management in these portfolios were 1212 billion  at december 31 2013  including 1051 billion  in targetdate retirement funds and 161 billion  in targetdate retirement trusts these targetdate retirement portfolios account for 175  of our managed assets at december 31 2013  compared with 154  at the end of 2012  

six price funds  growth stock  equity income  midcap growth  bluechip growth  value  capital appreciation   accounted for 25  of our investment advisory revenues in 2013  and 22  of our assets under management at december 31 2013  our largest client account relationship apart from the price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 3  of our investment advisory revenues in 2013  

strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our longterm success as of the end of 2013  76  of the t rowe price us mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the threeyear  period 77  outperformed for the fiveyear  period 82  outperformed for the 10year  period and 71  outperformed for the oneyear  period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar at december 31 2013  account for 78  of our rated funds assets under management the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks was substantially similar our targetdate retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive longterm performance with 100  of these funds outperforming their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three and fiveyear periods ended december 31 2013

additional information concerning our revenues results of operations and total assets and our assets under management during the past three years is contained in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10k as well as our consolidated financial statements which are included in item 8 of this report 

price funds 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

advisory services 

investment advisory revenues earned from the price funds are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

for the majority of the price funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate the tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the price funds when combined net assets of these price funds exceeds 400 billion  the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 295 basis points  for the first 400 billion  of net assets plus 275 basis points  for net assets in excess of 400 billion  to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective several funds including the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion the effective fee rates for those stock and bond funds we earned advisory fees of at least 60 million  from in 2013  varied from a low of 40  basis points for the maryland taxfree bond taxfree shortintermediate and shortterm bond funds to a high of 105  basis points for the emerging markets stock international discovery and latin america funds 

the fee rate of several of the price funds including the index and summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors do not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee an allinclusive fee covered both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds that we offer invest in a diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

we continued to voluntarily waive a portion of the advisory fees in 2013  of all of our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors advisory fees waived in 2013  totaled 512 million  or about 2  of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2013  compared to 350 million  in 2012  we expect that these fee waivers will continue in 2014  

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured

administrative services 

our subsidiaries provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds and their shareholders t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in both the price funds and funds outside the price fund complex plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the price funds

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals

distribution and servicing 

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the us on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and fixed income portfolios 

certain of the price funds also offer advisor and r classes of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes pay 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services in addition those price funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the price funds and enters into a triparty agreement with each intermediary and fund under the agreement each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statements of income we also recognize as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statements of income the corresponding cost paid to the thirdparty financial intermediaries who distribute these fund share classes the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including enhancements to our website 

other investment portfolios 

our other client investment portfolios had assets under management of 2571 billion  at december 31 2013  an increase of 272 billion  from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us at december 31 these portfolios included the following investment mandates 



we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations monthend

average valuations or end of billing period valuations in 2013  approximately 65  of advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 16  were based on monthend averages and 18  were based on end of billing period valuations 

our subsidiary t rowe price international provides sales distribution and market services to our luxembourgbased t rowe price funds sicav a selfmanaged société dinvestissement à capital variable the funds underlying this entity are distributed outside the us by t rowe price international and through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries the fees earned for these distribution and marketing services are part of the overall investment management fee t rowe price international earns for managing the sicav fund assets we recognize any related distribution fees paid to financial intermediaries in other operating expenses

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies hedge funds and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review

risk factors 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased funds and portfolios at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

 

page  10 

    

 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

the performance of our money market funds is impacted by the historically low interest rate environment 

our money market funds performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund when interest rates are at or near the historic lows that have recently existed the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolios income thereby reducing the yield of the funds to very low levels since the second half of 2009 and presently such an environment has led us to voluntarily waive a portion of our advisory fee earned on our money market funds in order to maintain yields at or above 0 for fund investors such actions reduce our advisory fee income and net income the actual amount of fees waived is dependent on a number of variables including among others changes in the net assets held by our money market funds changes in market yields changes in the expense levels of the funds and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers also bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds could experience significant redemptions which could decrease our revenues and net income for further discussion of the fees we waived in the current period managements expectation as to future fee waivers and the net cash flows of our money market funds please see our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this form 10k 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

page  11 

    

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income in the event that we were to decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

in 2013 we had an increase in the normally very low turnover of our investment professionals our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts sales and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse effect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties litigation and a decrease in revenues 

operating risks include 

 

page  12 

    

 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

 

under our agreements with the t rowe price mutual funds we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any of our sponsored investment products any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios in the us and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or 

page  13 

    

management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

 

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region and in london england we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in sponsored stock blended asset and bond funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments in the case of our availableforsale portfolio and the recognition of unrealized losses related to our sponsored investment portfolios that are held as trading and accounted for under the equity method in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position 

any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 26 investment in uti asset management company ltd uti an indian asset management company and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us and have an equity investment in uti our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

 

page  14 

    

 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of or impact the servicing of our clients and fund shareholders 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability additionally some regulations may not directly apply to our business but may impact the capital markets service providers or have another indirect effect on our ability to provide services to our clients 

potential impacts of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following 

 

 

 

 

page  15 

    

 

 

 

 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase of litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims class action suits and government actions alleging substantial monetary damages and penalties 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all current minimum requirements however a significant change in the required net capital an operating loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

page  16 

    

 

all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks such as hacking or viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism sabotage and other causes some of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure a suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected our systems or our thirdparty service providers’ systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our us sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios the other investment portfolios include separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts targetdate retirement trusts and luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us investment advisory clients outside the us account for 65  of our assets under management at december 31 2013  

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations 

we remain debtfree with substantial liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new fund offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future in the coming years we expect to increase funding for longterm initiatives to sustain and deepen our investment talent expand capabilities through enhanced technology and broaden our distribution reach globally including italy and germany

background 

us stocks produced excellent returns in 2013 as the economy and the labor market strengthened—despite federal tax increases and spending cuts that took effect in the first quarter the federal reserve continued their purchase of treasuries and agency mortgagebacked securities during the year to suppress longterm interest rates the equity market also overcame a sharp increase in longerterm rates stemming from the concern over the fed’s plans to curtail its asset purchases as well as the october us government shutdown and debt ceiling showdown the middecember announcement that the fed would reduce its asset purchases starting in january 2014 did not dismay investors because the central bank pledged to keep shortterm interest rates low as long as inflation remains contained equities in developed nonus markets underperformed us shares but still produced very good returns many parts of the eurozone emerged from recession while japan benefited from highly accommodative fiscal and monetary policies and a sharply weaker yen emerging markets equities fell slightly amid slowing economic growth in developing countries and fears that smaller fed asset purchases would lead to reduced global liquidity 

results of several major equity market indexes for the full year 2013  are as follows 



global bonds produced mostly negative returns in 2013 in the us high yield bonds produced solid gains and significantly outperformed investmentgrade issues amid favorable corporate fundamentals and strong demand for securities with a yield advantage investmentgrade bonds declined intermediate and longterm treasuries fared worst as longerterm interest rates rose sharply amid stronger growth and expectations for smaller fed asset purchases the 10year treasury note yield finished 2013  at 30  versus 18  at the end of 2012  government bonds in developed nonus markets produced moderate losses in us dollar terms emerging markets debt underperformed because of factors such as currency weakness and fears that the fed tapering would decrease global liquidity 

results of several major bond market indexes for the full year 2013  are as follows

assets under management 

reflecting the strong growth in equity markets our assets under management ended 2013  at a record 6924 billion  an increase  of 1156 billion  from the end of 2012  market appreciation drove this increase as 1276 billion  in market gains and income net of distributions not reinvested were reduced by net cash outflows of 120 billion  in the 2013  year 

assets under management in billions at the end of the year and changes during each of the last three years are detailed below 







our net cash flows in 2011  and 2012  and our sponsored us mutual fund cash flows in 2013  were sourced primarily from thirdparty financial intermediaries in 2013  a vast majority of the net outflows from our other investment portfolios were concentrated among several large institutional clients outside the us and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives repositioned their strategy allocations or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio the majority of the transfers from our sponsored mutual funds to our other investment portfolios disclosed in the table above in 2012  and 2013  were from our targetdate retirement funds to our collective investment trusts and targetdate retirement trusts 

our targetdate retirement funds and trusts which invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other t rowe price funds and t rowe price collective investment trusts and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings are a significant source of cash flows total net cash flows shown in the table above include 80 billion  in 2011  101 billion  in 2012  and 115 billion  in 2013  of net cash inflows that originated in these targetdate portfolios assets under management at 

page  22 

    

december 31 2013  in these retirement portfolios totaled 1212 billion  including 1051 billion  in targetdate retirement funds and 161 billion  in targetdate retirement trusts 

strong investment performance and brand awareness is a key driver to attracting assets and to our longterm success for 2013  76  of the t rowe price us mutual funds across their share classes outperformed their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the threeyear  period ended december 31 2013  77  outperformed for the fiveyear  period 82  outperformed for the 10year  period and 71  outperformed for the oneyear  period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that were given an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar at december 31 2013  account for 78  of our rated funds assets under management the performance of our institutional strategies against their benchmarks was substantially similar our targetdate retirement funds continue to deliver very attractive longterm performance with 100  of these funds outperforming their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three and fiveyear periods ended december 31 2013  

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from an increase to our assets under management 

results of operations 

2013  versus 2012  



investment advisory fees in   2013   are up over   2012   as  average assets under our management increase d 844 billion  to 6338 billion  for the 2013  year in addition the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management increased to 477  basis points during 2013  from the 472  basis points earned in 2012  due primarily to asset growth in higher than average fee rate strategies we voluntarily waived 512 million  in money market advisory fees in 2013  an increase of 162 million  from the 350 million  waived in 2012  in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors these fee waivers represent about 2  of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2013  fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts that have combined net assets at december 31 2013  of 163 billion  or 24  of our total assets under management the firm expects that these fee waivers will continue in 2014  

greater average assets under management and a higher annualized fee rate have increased our investment advisory revenues and helped lift our operating margin in 2013  to 470  compared to 451  in the 2012  period nonoperating investment income in 2013  is down compared to 2012  primarily because we sold fewer sponsored fund holdings in 2013  resulting in lower realized gains 

net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us were 21 billion  in 2013  an increase  of 188  or 3358 million  on higher average mutual fund assets average mutual fund assets in 2013  were 3912 billion  an increase  of 198  from the 2012  average mutual fund assets at december 31 2013  were 4353 billion  up   884 billion  from the end of 2012  

net inflows  into the mutual funds during 2013  were 102 billion  including 58 billion  into our stock and blended asset funds 35 billion  into our bond funds and 9 billion  into the money market funds these mutual fund net inflow amounts are 

page  23 

    

presented net of 77 billion  that clients transferred to the other investment portfolios primarily our collective investment trusts and targetdate retirement trusts without these transfers the mutual funds would have had net cash inflows of 179 billion  in 2013  market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 782 billion  to our mutual fund assets under management in 2013  

  

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increase d 948 million  or 118  to 8965 million  average assets in these portfolios were 2426 billion  during 2013  an increase  of 198 billion  or 89  from the 2012  year ending assets at december 31 2013  were 2571 billion  an increase  of 272 billion  from the end of 2012  market appreciation and income  of 494 billion  was reduced by net outflows  of 222 billion  during 2013  net outflows during 2013  are presented net of the 77 billion  assets that clients transferred in from the mutual funds the vast majority of these net outflows were concentrated among several large institutional clients outside the us and intermediary clients that changed their investment objectives repositioned their strategy allocations or experienced investment performance challenges within their portfolio 

administrative fees increase d 111 million  to 3437 million  in 2013  the increase  is primarily attributable to our transfer agent servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fee revenues are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fee revenues earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor r and variable annuity class shares of our sponsored portfolios were 1172 million  in 2013  an increase of 211 million  from the comparable 2012  period on greater average assets under management in these share classes the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of our consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs increase d 104  from 2012  to about 12 billion  a significant part of the increase  is attributable to a 454 million   increase  in our annual variable compensation program and a 372 million   increase  in salaries and related benefits we increased our average staff size by 41  over 2012  to support both business growth and added capabilities higher temporary staff expenses noncash stockbased compensation expense and other employee costs account for the remainder of the increase in compensation and related costs in the 2013  period at december 31 2013  we employed 5668  associates an increase  of 55  from the end of 2012  

advertising and promotion expenditures were 887 million  in 2013  compared to 898 million  in 2012  the decrease in cost from the 2012 period is primarily attributable to process efficiencies realized through the realignment of certain marketing activities we currently estimate that advertising and promotion expenditures for 2014  will be down about 5 from 2013  levels as we continue to realize the benefits of these process efficiencies 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increase d 208 million  or 101  versus 2012  the increase in costs is largely attributable to the expansion of our international facilities the opening of two new buildings located at our owings mills campus and continued investment in our technology capabilities including related maintenance programs the 2013  year also includes a nonrecurring charge of 35 million related to the termination of certain facility leases 

other operating expenses were 2576 million  in 2013  an increase  of 385 million  from the comparable 2012  period as increased business demands and our continued investment in our capabilities have increased our costs these costs include consulting and professional fees costs related to our defined contribution recordkeeping business information services and other thirdparty services we also made a higher charitable contribution to the t rowe price foundation in 2013  than in 2012  

nonoperating investment income 

our nonoperating investment income which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses was down   78 million  from the 2012  period the decrease is due in part to the 2013  results including 135 million  in gains realized on the sale of certain sponsored fund holdings compared with 351 million  in gains realized in the comparable 2012  period this reduction in realized gains was partially offset by 79 million  in higher dividends received on our sponsored mutual fund holdings and 56 million  in higher gains recognized on our other investments the 2013  year also includes a 15 million  gain recognized on the sale of our savings bank subsidiary 

page  24 

    

provision for income taxes 

our 2013  effective tax rate of 384  is unchanged from the 2012  rate the firm currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2014  will be about 384  our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our nonus subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from us and nonus sources or changes in tax rates in relevant nonus jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future

investment advisory revenues were up 103 or 2430 million to nearly 26 billion in 2012 as average assets under our management increased 523 billion to 5494 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 472 basis points during 2012 virtually unchanged from the 473 basis points earned in 2011 we continued to voluntarily waive a portion of our money market advisory fees in 2012 in order to maintain a positive or zero yield for fund investors these fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts and totaled 350 million or about 1 of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2012 as compared to 364 million in 2011 combined net assets at december 31 2012 of the funds and trusts in which we waived fees in 2012 was 154 billion or 27 of our total assets under management

net revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us were 18 billion in 2012 an increase of 114 or 1827 million on higher average mutual fund assets average mutual fund assets in 2012 were 3266 billion an increase of 118 from the 2011 average mutual fund assets at december 31 2012 were 3469 billion up 575 billion from the end of 2011 

net inflows to the mutual funds during 2012 were 157 billion including 86 billion into our stock and blended asset funds and 75 billion into our bond funds our money market funds had net outflows of 4 billion mutual fund net inflows include 64 billion that originated in our targetdate retirement funds which in turn invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings these fund net inflow amounts are presented net of 45 billion that was transferred to the other investment portfolios during the year these transfers were primarily from our targetdate retirement funds to our targetdate retirement trusts market appreciation and income net of distributions not reinvested added 418 billion to our mutual fund assets under management in 2012

administrative fees increased 114 million to 3326 million in 2012 the increase is attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor r and vip ii classes of our sponsored mutual funds were 961 million in 2012 an increase of 215 million from 2011 the increase includes 130 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes and 85 million earned primarily on r class shares in the first quarter of 2012 

page  25 

    

for which the comparable 2011 fees were netted against related distribution and servicing costs the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the cost paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of the consolidated statements of income 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs were 10 billion an increase of 778 million or 80 compared to 2011 the largest part of the increase is attributable to a 337 million increase in salaries and related benefits which results from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2012 combined with a 21 increase in our average staff size from 2011 the 2012 change also includes a 320 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs the remainder of the change from 2011 is attributable to increased use of outside contractors to meet growing business demands higher noncash stockbased compensation expense and other employee related costs at december 31 2012 we employed 5372 associates an increase of 22 from the end of 2011 to support both business growth and added capabilities 

advertising and promotion expenditures were 898 million in 2012 compared to 908 million in 2011 we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally 

distribution and servicing costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source assets into the advisor r and vip ii classes of our sponsored mutual funds were 961 million in 2012 an increase of 215 million from 2011 the increase includes 130 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes and 85 million incurred primarily on r class shares in the first quarter of 2012 for which the comparable 2011 costs were netted against related distribution and servicing fees the costs are offset entirely by the 12b1 fees we earn these fees are reported as distribution and servicing fees on the face of the consolidated statements of income 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 186 million or 99 versus 2011 the change includes the added costs incurred to expand our facilities around the world as well as update our technology capabilities including related maintenance programs to meet increasing business demands 

other operating expenses increased 211 million or 107 from 2011 including 164 million in certain thirdparty servicing costs incurred in 2012 for which the comparable 2011 costs were reported as reductions of advisory and administrative fee revenues 

nonoperating investment income 

our nonoperating investment income which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses was up 471 million from the 2011 period this increase includes 326 million in gains realized in the second half of 2012 from the sale of certain of our investments in sponsored funds to seed other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the us the balance of the change is primarily attributable to 84 million in higher net gains recognized on our costmethod investments and trading securities and 38 million in larger dividends earned on our mutual fund investments 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2012 was 384 as compared to 382 in 2011 our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our nonus subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates 

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2013  stockholders’ equity increase d from 38 billion  to 48 billion  in 2013  we paid 152  per share in regular dividends and expended 141 million  to repurchase 200000  common shares from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations we generally repurchase shares of our common stock over time to offset the dilution created by our equitybased compensation plans tangible book value is 42 billion  at december 31 2013  and our cash and fund investment holdings total 30 billion  given the availability of these financial resources we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity 

at december 31 2013  we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling 407 million  to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment we currently expect total capital expenditures for property and equipment in 2014  to be approximately 145 million  these outstanding commitments if called and the capital expenditures will be funded from operating resources

2013  versus 2012  

operating activities during 2013  provided cash flows of 12 billion  up   3304 million  from the 2012  period including a 1641 million   increase  in net income timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues payables and accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities increase d our operating cash flows by 624 million  compared to the 2012  year the increase from 2012  is also a result of a 637 million  reduction in cash used to make net purchases of trading securities held by our consolidated sponsored investment portfolios and a 216 million  reduction in the adjustment for gains realized from the sale of certain availableforsale sponsored fund investments as less investments were sold in 2013  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4375 million  up   1274 million  from 2012  we made 601 million   more  net investments in our sponsored funds during 2013  compared with 2012  as we utilized more of our cash to make additional investments as compared to the rebalancing of the portfolio in 2012  the 2012  year also included greater net cash proceeds of 401 million  from the sale of debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary as the bank was sold in early december 2013  we spent 289 million  more in property and equipment additions in 2013  compared to the 2012  period the 2013  year also includes a net cash outflow of 117 million  related to the sale of our savings bank subsidiary as the cash that was held by the bank on the closing date was greater than the 236 million  in proceeds we received 

net cash used in financing activities was 2768 million  in 2013  down   3347 million  from the comparable 2012  period the decrease is primarily attributable to the repurchase of 21 million  more shares of common stock and the payment of a 100 special dividend in 2012  

2012  versus 2011  

operating activities during 2012 provided cash flows of 9028 million down 456 million from 2011 due in part to the 927 million in net investments made by the consolidated sponsored funds we seeded during the first half of 2012 for which we have a controlling financial interest timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues payables and accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities decreased our operating cash flows by 425 million compared to the 2011 year the cash flows from operating activities in 2012 also includes a reduction for the 351 million in gains recognized on the sale of certain fund investments as the related cash flow activity is reflected in net cash used in investing activities these operating cash flow decreases are offset by a 1104 million increase in net income and increases in noncash expenses for depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation which are added back to net income to determine cash from operations 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 3101 million up 1451 million from 2011 we made 2183 million more net investments in our sponsored funds during 2012 compared with 2011 this increase was offset by greater net cash proceeds of 734 million in 2012 from the sale of more debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary 

net cash used in financing activities was 6115 million in 2012 down 871 million from the comparable 2011 period during 2011 we expended 3445 million more for stock repurchases including the repurchase of 64 million more shares than in 2012 this reduction in cash used was partially offset by the change in customer deposits at our savings bank subsidiary during 2012 compared to 2011 as well as a 2855 million increase in dividends paid the increase in dividends paid in 2012 is due to a 03 increase in our quarterly pershare dividend and the payment of a 100 per share special dividend in december 2012 the balance of the decrease from 2011 in cash used is due to greater proceeds and tax benefits related to our stockbased compensation plans on increased exercise activity in late 2012 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2013  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2014  and future years the information also excludes the 48 million  of uncertain tax positions discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 

page  27 

    



we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships totaling 407 million  at december 31 2013  the vast majority of these additional contributions will be made to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment in addition to such amounts a percentage of prior distributions may be called under certain circumstances 

in january 2014 we renewed and extended our operating lease at our corporate headquarters in baltimore maryland through 2027 this lease agreement increases the above disclosed total noncancelable operating lease commitments by an additional 1330 million  the vast majority of which will be paid after 2018 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2013  annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

otherthantemporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds as availableforsale if we are not deemed to a have a controlling financial interest at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

in determining whether a mutual fund holding is otherthantemporarily impaired we consider many factors including the duration of time it has existed the severity of the impairment any subsequent changes in value and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value subject to the other considerations noted above we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an otherthantemporary impairment we may also recognize an otherthantemporary loss of less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

we sold our savings bank subsidiary in december 2013 through the date of the transaction we generally classified the debt securities held by the bank as availableforsale and would mark their carrying amount to fair value quarterly and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income we would review each individual security position that had an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment was other than temporary the impairment was considered to be otherthantemporary if the impairment was caused by a change in credit quality that affected our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intended to sell the security or believed it was more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovering its cost minor impairments of 5 or less were generally considered temporary 

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments  we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

page  28 

    

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit – our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million  

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value based method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes optionpricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance 

we have considered all newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements including that which we have not yet adopted we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation 

forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to our revenues net income and earnings per share on common stock changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels our estimated effective income tax rate and our expectations regarding financial markets future transactions dividends investments capital expenditures and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k annual report further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in global financial markets that result 

page  29 

    

in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any otherthantemporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investee’s net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the us and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the us variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option and other equity grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of fund shares we have chosen to use a variant of each funds net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe the volatility in each funds net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each funds investment objective the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of our fund investments at yearend was determined by using the lower of each fund’s lowest net asset value per share during 2013  or its net asset value per share at december 31 2013  reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all funds experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  



the comparable potential loss of value in 2012  using the same methodology noted above was 1538 million  on sponsored fund investments of 11401 million  during 2013  we actually experienced net unrealized gains of 1497 million  

  

as availableforsale securities we recognize unrealized losses that are considered temporary in other comprehensive income we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating investment income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk 

page  30 

    

by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

we also held equity method investments of 2315 million  at december 31 2013  including our 1226 million  equity investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount in addition our investment in uti exposes us to foreign currency risk related to translating our proportionate share of its financial statements which are denominated in indian rupees inr to us dollars usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this foreign currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment we had a cumulative translation loss  net of tax of 269 million  at december 31 2013  related to our investment in uti 

we operate in several foreign countries of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in usd we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

the late thomas rowe price jr founded our firm in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000 

we derive the majority of our consolidated revenue and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries primarily t rowe price associates inc and t rowe price international ltd our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base across four primary distribution channels thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and other countries individual us investors on a direct basis us defined contribution retirement plans and institutional investors globally as of december 31 2012 approximately forty percent of our assets under management are sourced from our thirdparty financial intermediary distribution channel with the remaining three distribution channels equally making up the balance 

we manage a broad range of us and international stock blended asset bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus and can exchange balances among the funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change investment management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds 

equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global international or sector investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity and asset allocation investment strategies including targetdate retirement investment portfolios as well as active systematic and municipal taxfree management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities received from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the us and england with additional staff based in argentina australia hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling 

from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund or investment portfolio if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund or investment mandate in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing fund shareholders and investors at present the following funds are closed to all new investors 

page 2 

    



we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting distribution and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the t rowe price complex brokerage and trust services substantially all of our administrative and distribution and servicing fee revenues in 2012  were determined based generally on the recovery of our related costs to provide these services therefore changes in our administrative revenues distribution and servicing fees and related expenses generally do not significantly affect our net operating income or net income 

information concerning our revenues results of operations and total assets and our assets under management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial statements and in note 2 thereto which are both included in item 8 of this form 10k 

2012  developments 

major equity markets produced strong returns in 2012  despite a eurozone recession the sovereign debt crisis muted us economic growth uncertainty surrounding us fiscal policy after 2012 and a slowdown in emerging economies equities were supported by solid us corporate earnings and actions taken by central banks around the world to stimulate economic growth bonds produced good returns over the year with high yield and emerging market issues outperforming other issues as income seeking investors continued favoring securities with attractive yields in the low interest rate environment higher market valuations and income net of mutual fund distributions not reinvested increased our assets under management by 701 billion  in 2012  our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows of 172 billion  primarily from thirdparty financial intermediaries as a result our assets under management increased 873 billion  over the course of 2012  and ended the year at 5768 billion  

the firm’s longterm investment advisory results relative to our peers remain strong with 78  of the price funds across their share classes surpassing their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the threeyear period ended december 31 2012  84  outperforming for the fiveyear period 78  outperforming for the 10year period and 74  outperforming for the oneyear period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset mutual funds that ended the quarter with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar account for 76  of our rated price funds’ assets under management 

details of our assets under management in billions at december 31 2012  are as follows

nonus dollar denominated securities account for about 836 billion  or 145  of our total assets under management at december 31 2012  

our targetdate retirement portfolios which provide shareholders with single diversified portfolios that invest in underlying price funds and other investment portfolios continue to be a significant source of our asset growth of the firm’s net inflows of 172 billion  in 2012  101 billion  originated in these portfolios assets under management in these portfolios were 889 billion  at december 31 2012  including 802 billion  in targetdate retirement funds and 87 billion  in targetdate retirement trusts and represent 154  of our managed assets at yearend 

six price funds  growth stock  equity income  midcap growth  bluechip growth  value  new income   accounted for 25  of our investment advisory revenues in 2012  and 21  of our assets under management at december 31 2012  our largest client account relationship apart from the t rowe price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 3  of our investment advisory revenues in 2012  our international clients account for 95  of our total assets under management at december 31 2012  

see the background section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report for more information on the 2012  market environment in which we operated 

price funds 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

advisory services 

investment advisory revenues earned from the price funds are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee rate for the majority of the price funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective 

the effective tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the price funds when combined net assets of these price funds exceeds 3000 billion  the weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers is 30 basis points  for the first 3000 billion  of net assets plus 28 basis points  for net assets in excess of 300 billion to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase the group charge component of a funds advisory fee rate and therefore the advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

the individual fund rates are flat rates with the exception of the individual rate for the blue chip growth equity income growth stock and midcap growth funds these funds have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual rate is reduced by about 15 on net assets in excess of 15 billion 

the total effective fee rates determined in the above manner for those stock and bond funds that incurred advisory fees of at least 60 million  in 2012  varied from a low of 40  basis points for the maryland taxfree bond taxfree shortintermediate and short term bond funds to a high of 105  basis points for the emerging markets stock international discovery and latin america funds 

the fee rate of several of the price funds including the index and summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors do not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee which covers both investment management and ordinary operating expenses each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds that we offer invest in a diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

page 4 

    

we continued to voluntarily waive a portion of the advisory fees in 2012 of all of our money market funds and trusts in order to maintain a positive or zero yield for fund investors advisory fees waived in 2012 totaled 350 million  or about 1  of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2012  compared to 364 million  in 2011  we expect that these fee waivers will continue in 2013  

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs but such recovery is not assured 

details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

distribution and servicing 

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the us on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and fixed income portfolios 

certain of the price funds also offer advisor and r classes of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services in addition those price funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that incurs a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the price funds and enters into agreements with each intermediary payment of 12b1 fees is made by each fund directly to the applicable intermediaries 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statements of income we also recognize as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statements of income the corresponding payment of these fees from each fund to the thirdparty financial intermediaries the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including enhancements to our website 

administrative services 

we provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds through our subsidiaries t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities and technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in 

page 5 

    

the price funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the funds 

our trustee services are provided by another subsidiary t rowe price trust company through this marylandchartered limitedservice trust company we offer collective investment trust funds for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for retirement plans and iras t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans another subsidiary t rowe price savings bank issues federally insured certificates of deposit 

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals

we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations monthend average valuations or end of billing period valuations in 2012  approximately 59  of advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 22  were based on monthend averages and 18  were based on end of billing period valuations

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks mutual fund companies and other financial institutions in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially 

page 8 

    

greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship

risk factors 

tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the us and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

 page 9 

    

 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period and may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

the performance of our money market funds is impacted by the historically low interest rate environment 

our money market funds performance or yield is dependent on the income earned from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund when interest rates are at the historic lows that presently exist the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolios income thereby reducing the yield of the funds to very low levels since the second half of 2009 and presently such an environment has led us to voluntarily waive a portion of our advisory fee earned on our money market funds in order to maintain yields at or above 0 for fund investors such actions reduce our advisory fee income and net income the actual amount of fees waived is dependent on a number of variables including among others changes in the net assets held by our money market funds changes in market yields changes in the expense levels of the funds and our willingness to voluntarily continue such fee waivers also bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds could experience significant redemptions which could decrease our revenues and net income see our discussion under results of operations in our management discussion and analysis related to fees waived in the current period managements expectation as to future fee waivers and the net cash flows of our money market funds 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60days notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

page 10 

    

 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income in the event that we were to decide to reduce the fees we charge for investment advisory services in response to competitive pressures revenues and operating margins could be adversely impacted 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts management and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse effect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties litigation and a decrease in revenues 

operating risks include 

 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

page 11 

    

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

 

under our agreements with the t rowe price mutual funds we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected while we are under no obligation to provide financial support to any of our sponsored investment products any financial support provided would reduce capital available for other purposes and may have an adverse effect on revenues and net income  

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios in the us and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks cyberattacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by

a significant portion of our business operations are concentrated in the baltimore maryland region and in london england we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose the availability of any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to timely resume our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in sponsored stock blended asset and bond funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

our savings bank subsidiary subjects us to investment credit risk by maintaining a portfolio of investments in assetbacked debt securities with maturity schedules intended to correspond with customer time deposit maturity dates in the event that underlying securities are impaired in maturity value or do not yield returns in excess of customer deposit interest payments our assets and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities in order to maintain or enhance our competitive position 

any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 26 investment in uti asset management company ltd uti an indian asset management company and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the us and have an equity investment in uti our international operations require us to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

 page 13 

    

legal and regulatory risks 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden impose significant financial and strategic costs on our business and cause a loss of mutual fund investors or clients 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations or impact our expenses and profitability for example the volcker rule as currently proposed has led us to continue to evaluate whether it remains prudent to maintain our savings bank subsidiary in light of the potential restrictions the rule could place on our other business activities although our savings bank operation is not material to the operating results of the company the final terms of the rule are not yet settled and uncertainty related to how it may apply to our funds and affiliates could negatively impact our ability to launch and seed new funds if we continue to maintain a savings bank affiliate additionally aspects of the rule present the risk that liquidity in capital markets may be impacted and it may be more difficult or costly to execute certain security transactions on behalf of our clients 

potential impacts of other current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements include without limitation the following

yet been implemented and interpretations of certain provisions are not yet final depending on such interpretations the aifmd may impact remuneration policies capital requirements and the manner in which affiliated entities provide services to funds covered by the directive 

we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals however any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations they may also result in changes to our product or service offerings the changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase of litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot be assured that our insurance will cover every liability and loss to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum requirements however a significant operating or investment loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

page 15 

    

all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to cyberattacks such as hacking or viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism and other causes some of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure a suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive infrastructure if we are unable to upgrade our infrastructure in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected our systems or our thirdparty service providers’ systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our us sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios the other managed investment portfolios include separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment portfolios including collective investment trusts and luxembourgbased funds offered to investors outside the us and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us investment advisory clients outside the us account for 95  of our assets under management at december 31 2012  

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations 

we remain debtfree with substantial liquidity and resources that allow us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals technologies and new fund offerings and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service both now and in the future

background 

major equity indexes produced strong returns in 2012 despite a eurozone recession the sovereign debt crisis muted us economic growth uncertainty surrounding us fiscal policy after 2012 and a slowdown in emerging economies equities were supported by solid us corporate earnings and actions taken by central banks around the world to stimulate economic growth during the year the federal reserve kept the federal funds rate near 0 and implemented a thirdround of quantitative easing in the form of an openended policy of monthly agency mortgagebacked securities purchases further the federal reserve announced at its december meeting that it would add openended monthly purchases of longterm treasury securities when its current maturity extension program for treasuries ends in 2013 it also confirmed that it expects to keep the federal funds rate very low at least through mid2015 as 2013 began equity markets had positive momentum as us congress passed legislation on january 1st that delayed deep spending cuts for two months and prevented many broadbased tax increases 

results of several major equity market indexes for the full year 2012  are as follows 



bonds produced good returns over the year high yield and emerging market issues outperformed all others as incomeseeking investors continued favoring securities with attractive yields in the low interest rate environment outside the us investors also sought bonds issued by developing countries due to their lower debt levels and better growth prospects relative to developed countries longterm treasury bond yields were essentially flat for the year and remained near historic lows in response to weak global economic growth and the federal reserves maturity extension program noted above the yield on the benchmark 10year us treasury at december 31 2012  was 18  compared with 19 at the end of 2011 

results of several major bond market indexes for the full year 2012  are as follows 



assets under management 

with this market environment as a backdrop investors entrusted 172 billion  to our management in 2012  total assets under management ended 2012  at a record 5768 billion  an increase of 873 billion  from the end of 2011 assets under management in billions at the end of and changes over each of the last three years are detailed below 



page 20 

    





our 2010 net cash inflows were sourced most significantly from thirdparty financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world whereas net cash flows in 2011 and 2012 were sourced primarily from thirdparty financial intermediaries our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows to our firm 

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management 

results of operations 

2012  versus 2011  

investment advisory revenues were up 103  or 2430 million  to nearly 26 billion  in 2012  as  average assets under our management increase d 523 billion  to 5494 billion  the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 472  basis points during 2012  virtually unchanged from the 473  basis points earned in 2011  we continued to voluntarily waive a portion of our money market advisory fees in 2012 in order to maintain a positive or zero yield for fund investors these fees were waived from each of our money market funds and trusts and totaled 350 million  or about 1  of total investment advisory revenues earned in 2012  as compared to 364 million  in 2011  combined net assets at december 31 2012  of the funds and trusts in which we waived fees in 2012  was 154 billion  or 27  of our total assets under management the firm expects that these fee waivers will continue in 2013

administrative fees increase d 114 million  to 3326 million  in 2012  the increase is attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor r and vip ii classes of our sponsored mutual funds were 961 million  in 2012  an increase of 215 million  from 2011  the increase includes 130 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes and 85 million earned primarily on r class shares in the first quarter of 2012 for which the comparable 2011 fees were netted against related distribution and servicing costs the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the cost paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of the consolidated statements of income 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs were 10 billion  an increase  of 778 million  or 80  compared to 2011  the largest part of the increase is attributable to a 337 million   increase  in salaries and related benefits which results from a modest increase in salaries at the beginning of 2012 combined with a 21   increase  in our average staff size from 2011 the 2012  change also includes a 320 million   increase  in our annual variable compensation programs the remainder of the change from 2011  is attributable to increased use of outside contractors to meet growing business demands higher noncash stockbased compensation expense and other employee related costs at december 31 2012  we employed 5372  associates an increase  of 22  from the end of 2011  to support both business growth and added capabilities 

advertising and promotion expenditures were 898 million  in 2012  compared to 908 million  in 2011  we currently estimate that advertising and promotion expenditures for 2013  will be similar to 2012  levels we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally 

distribution and servicing costs paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source assets into the advisor r and vip ii classes of our sponsored mutual funds were 961 million  in 2012  an increase of 215 million  from 2011  the increase includes 130 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes and 85 million incurred primarily on r class shares in the first quarter of 2012 for which the comparable 2011 costs were netted against related distribution and servicing fees the costs are offset entirely by the 12b1 fees we earn these fees are reported as distribution and servicing fees on the face of the consolidated statements of income

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increase d 186 million  or 99  versus 2011  the change includes the added costs incurred to expand our facilities around the world as well as update our technology capabilities including related maintenance programs to meet increasing business demands 

other operating expenses increase d 211 million  or 107  from 2011  including 164 million  in certain thirdparty servicing costs incurred in 2012 for which the comparable 2011 costs were reported as reductions of advisory and administrative fee revenues 

nonoperating investment income 

our nonoperating investment income which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses was up   471 million  from the 2011  period this increase includes 326 million in gains realized in the second half of 2012 from the sale of certain of our investments in sponsored funds to seed other sponsored funds in support of our distribution efforts outside the us the balance of the change is primarily attributable to 84 million  in higher net gains recognized on our costmethod investments and trading securities and 38 million in larger dividends earned on our mutual fund investments 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2012  was 384  as compared to 382  in 2011  the firm currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2013  will be about 385  our effective income tax rate reflects the relative contribution of pretax income generated by our nonus subsidiaries that are subject to tax rates lower than our us rates changes in the relative contribution of pretax income from us and nonus sources or changes in tax rates in relevant nonus jurisdictions may affect our effective income tax rate and overall net income in the future

investment advisory revenues were up 159 or 3222 million to 23 billion in 2011 as average assets under our management increased 745 billion to 4971 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 473 basis points during 2011 compared to 480 basis points earned in 2010 the decrease in our average annualized fee rate was primarily a result of the 113 million increase in money market management fees voluntarily waived by the firm in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors the firm waived 364 million in money market fees in 2011 compared to 251 million in 2010 

net revenues increased 3799 million or 160 to 27 billion operating expenses were 15 billion in 2011 an increase of 1895 million or 142 overall net operating income for 2011 increased 1904 million or 184 to 12 billion the increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue increased our operating margin for 2011 to 447 from 438 in 2010 net income increased 1010 million or 150 to 7732 million from the 2010 period our diluted earnings per share on our common stock increased 154 to 292 from the 253 earned in 2010

page 23 

    

thirdparty intermediaries into our fixed income portfolios from institutional investors and into our other sponsored portfolios during the year these inflows were partially offset by outflows from our equity portfolios by a few institutional investors that were reducing risk in their portfolios in the wake of the volatile market environment experienced in 2011 lower market valuations reduced assets under management in these portfolios by 24 billion 

administrative fees increased 269 million to 3212 million in 2011 the increase is attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors

compensation and related costs were 9698 million an increase of 1094 million or 127 compared to 2010 the largest part of the increase is attributable to a 469 million increase in salaries and related benefits which results from a 56 annual increase in our average staff size the 2011 change also includes a 364 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs greater use of outside contractors to meet growing business demands increased our 2011 costs by 112 million the remainder of the change from 2010 is attributable to higher noncash stockbased compensation expense and other employee related costs at december 31 2011 we employed 5255 associates an increase of 40 from the end of 2010 to support both business growth and added capabilities 

advertising and promotion expenditures were 908 million up 39 million or 45 compared to 2010 we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 153 million or 89 versus 2010 the change includes the impact of placing our new technology support facility into service in february 2011 as well as the added costs to update our technology capabilities including related maintenance programs to meet increasing business demands 

other operating expenses increased 295 million or 175 from 2010 the charitable contribution made to the t rowe price foundation in 2011 was higher than in 2010 and we increased our spending on professional fees information and other thirdparty services and travel to meet increasing business demands the increases in these costs were offset by the 164 million charge incurred in 2010 from the onetime contribution made to certain money market funds that did not reoccur in 2011 

nonoperating investment income 

our nonoperating investment income which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses was down 98 million from the 2010 period this decrease is primarily due to the 2010 period including 76 million in gains realized on the sale of certain mutual fund investments and 22 million recognized in early 2010 on the settlement and valuation of the forward contracts used to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our investment in uti asset management company limited uti the 2011 period includes 64 million in net earnings from our investment in uti an increase of 11 million over the earnings recognized in 2010 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2011 is 382 as compared to 372 in 2010 the increase is primarily attributable to higher effective state tax rates as well as greater discrete tax benefits recognized in 2010 from the settlement of state income tax positions and the firm’s international reorganization 

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2012  stockholders’ equity increase d from 34 billion  to 38 billion  in 2012  we expended 1352 million  to repurchase 23 million  common shares and paid 236 per share in dividends including a 100 per share special dividend paid in december 2012 from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations tangible book value is 32 billion  at 

page 24 

    

december 31 2012  and our cash and our fund investment holdings total 20 billion  given the availability of these financial resources we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity 

at december 31 2012  we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling 365 million  to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment we presently anticipate funding 2013  property and equipment expenditures of about 125 million  from our cash balances and operating cash inflows 

2012  versus 2011  

operating activities during 2012  provided cash flows of 9028 million  down   456 million  from 2011  due in part to the 927 million  in net investments made by the consolidated sponsored funds we seeded during the first half of 2012 for which we have a controlling financial interest timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues payables and accrued liabilities and other assets and liabilities decrease d our operating cash flows by 425 million  compared to the 2011  year the cash flows from operating activities in 2012 also includes a reduction for the 351 million  in gains recognized on the sale of certain fund investments as the related cash flow activity is reflected in net cash used in investing activities these operating cash flow decreases are offset by a 1104 million  increase in net income and increases in noncash expenses for depreciation amortization and stockbased compensation which are added back to net income to determine cash from operations 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 3101 million  up   1451 million  from 2011  we made 2183 million   more  net investments in our sponsored funds during 2012  compared with 2011  this increase was offset by greater net cash proceeds of 734 million  in 2012  from the sale of more debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary 

net cash used in financing activities was 6115 million  in 2012  down   871 million  from the comparable 2011  period during 2011 we expended 3445 million  more for stock repurchases including the repurchase of 64 million more shares than in 2012 this reduction in cash used was partially offset by the change in customer deposits at our savings bank subsidiary during 2012 compared to 2011 as well as a 2855 million  increase in dividends paid the increase in dividends paid in 2012 is due to a 03 increase in our quarterly pershare dividend and the payment of a 100 per share special dividend in december 2012 the balance of the decrease from 2011 in cash used is due to greater proceeds and tax benefits related to our stockbased compensation plans on increased exercise activity in late 2012 

2011  versus 2010  

operating activities during 2011 provided cash flows of 9484 million up 2156 million from 2010 including a 1010 million increase in net income the increase also includes an 817 million change in the timing differences in the cash settlement of our income taxes accounts receivable and accrued revenues and payables and accrued liabilities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1650 million down 1119 million from the 2010 period cash flows in 2010 included 1436 million in cash used to purchase our 26 equity interest in uti we spent 357 million less in property and equipment expenditures in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the construction of our technology support facility being substantially complete at the end of 2010 these reductions in cash used in 2011 were offset by an increase of 570 million in net investments made into our sponsored funds compared to the 2010 period 

net cash used in financing activities was 6986 million in 2011 up 3125 million from the 2010 period we increased our stock repurchases by expending 2397 million more in 2011 compared to the 2010 year dividends paid during 2011 increased 390 million from the 2010 period due primarily to a 04 increase in our quarterly pershare dividend the impact of dividends paid and stock repurchases was greater in 2011 as proceeds related to our stockbased compensation plans decreased 478 million on reduced exercise activity

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2012  other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2013  and future years the information also excludes the 49 million  of uncertain tax positions discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 



we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment totaling 365 million  at december 31 2012  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets the revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2012  annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

otherthantemporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as availableforsale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

in determining whether a mutual fund holding is otherthantemporarily impaired we consider many factors including the duration of time it has existed the severity of the impairment any subsequent changes in value and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value subject to the other considerations noted above with respect to duration of time we believe a fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an otherthantemporary impairment we may also recognize an otherthantemporary loss of less than six months in our consolidated statements of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an otherthantemporary loss that we will recognize in our consolidated statements of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost minor impairments of 5 or less are generally considered temporary 

otherthantemporary impairments of equity method investments  we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

page 26 

    

goodwill  we internally conduct manageand report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit – our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 6657 million  

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income using a fair value based method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes optionpricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance 

we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements including that which we have not yet adopted we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation 

forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to our revenues net income and earnings per share on common stock changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels our estimated effective income tax rate and our expectations regarding financial markets future transactions dividends investments capital expenditures and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k annual report further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows 

page 27 

    

in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any otherthantemporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investee’s net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the us and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the us variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option and other equity grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of fund shares we have chosen to use a variant of each funds net asset value to quantify the equity price risk as we believe that the volatility in each funds net asset value best reflects the underlying risk potential as well as the market trends surrounding each funds investment objective the potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits of our fund investments at yearend was determined by using the lower of each fund’s lowest net asset value per share during 2012  or its net asset value per share at december 31 2012 reduced by 10 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all funds experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

  



the comparable potential loss of value in 2011  if we would have applied the same methodology noted above would have been 801 million  on sponsored fund investments of 7645 million  during 2012  we actually experienced net unrealized gains of 999 million  

  

because our fund holdings are considered availableforsale securities we recognize unrealized losses that are considered temporary in other comprehensive income we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating investment income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary 

page 28 

    

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 

we also hold other investments of 3047 million  at december 31 2012  including our 1398 million  equity investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount in addition our investment in uti exposes us to foreign currency risk related to translating our proportionate share of its financial statements which are denominated in indian rupees inr to us dollars usd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this foreign currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment our cumulative translation loss  net of tax at december 31 2012  was 126 million  

we operate in several foreign countries of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in usd we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

price funds 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

advisory and distribution services 

investment advisory revenues earned from the price funds are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee rate for the majority of the price funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group rate that is set based on the aggregate net assets of nearly all of the price funds and an individual fund rate that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective 

the effective tiered group rate when combined net assets of nearly all of the price funds exceed 220 billion is calculated based on a weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers of 300 basis points for the first 220 billion of net assets plus 285 basis points for net assets in excess of 220 billion to the extent that the combined net assets of these funds increase the group charge component of a fund’s advisory fee rate and therefore the advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease the individual fund rate for the growth stock midcap growth equity income and blue chip growth is the weighted average of the base individual rate plus a 15 reduction in the individual rate for net assets in excess of 15 billion 

the total effective fee rates determined in the above manner for those stock and bond funds that incurred advisory fees of at least 5 million in 2011 varied from a low of 40 basis points for the short term bond maryland taxfree bond and taxfree shortintermediate funds to a high of 105 basis points for the emerging europe  mediterranean international discovery latin america and emerging markets stock funds 

several of the price funds including the index and summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors do not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an allinclusive fee which covers both investment management and ordinary operating expenses each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds invest in a diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest 

our money market funds experienced advisory fee rates in 2011 from a low of negative seven basis points for the california taxfree money fund to a high of 18 basis points for the summit cash reserves fund as we continued to voluntarily waive money market advisory fees to maintain a zero or positive yield for fund 

  

page 5 

investors we waived 364 million fees in 2011 compared to 251 million in 2010 we began waiving our money market advisory fees during the second half of 2009 and anticipate these fee waivers will continue in 2012 

details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and fixed income portfolios 

certain of the price funds also offer advisor and r classes of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services in addition those price funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that incurs a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the price funds and enters into agreements with each intermediary payment of 12b1 fees is made by each fund directly to the applicable intermediaries 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in our consolidated statement of income we also recognize as distribution and servicing costs in the consolidated statement of income the corresponding payment of these fees from each fund to the thirdparty financial intermediaries the fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to thirdparty intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of these selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications

capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in the print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new and existing investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including enhancements to our website

the spectrum and retirement fund of fund series are not presented in the table because their assets are already included in their underlying fund holdings 

our operating subsidiaries invest in many of the t rowe price funds 

other investment portfolios 

we managed 2001 billion at december 31 2011 in other client investment portfolios up 7 billion from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios such as collective investment trusts luxembourgbased mutual funds and variable annuity insurance plans at december 31 these portfolios included the following investment assets 

 

 we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate the value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations monthend average valuations or end of billing period valuations in 2011 approximately 53 of advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations 27 were based on monthend averages and 19 were based on end of billing period valuations

all aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and the price funds shareholders they generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to comply with laws and regulations possible sanctions that may be imposed on us in the event that we fail to comply include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain business activities for specified periods of time revocation of our investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements including those of various federal state and international regulatory agencies each of our subsidiaries’ net capital as defined meets or exceeds all minimum requirements 

competition 

as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks and other financial institutions in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship 

employees 

at december 31 2011 we employed 5255 associates up 4 from the 5052 associates employed at the end of 2010 we may add additional temporary and parttime personnel to our staff from time to time to meet periodic and special project demands primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative services

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from time to time in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

page 11 

  

  

 a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60day notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

page 12 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them we believe that competition within the investment management industry will intensify as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income if we are required to lower our fees in order to remain competitive our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed especially over shorter periods of time and others may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts management and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse affect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties and litigation 

operating risks include 

 

  

   

page 13 

 any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 under our agreements with the t rowe price mutual funds we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected 

  

page 14 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios in the us and abroad and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

these contracted thirdparty intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on thirdparty financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these thirdparty intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to continue our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

  

page 15 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in our stock blended asset and bond mutual funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant other than temporary impairments in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

the investment performance of our savings bank subsidiary could adversely affect our assets and results of operations 

we have a savings bank subsidiary that accepts time deposits from customers pays a fixed rate of interest to them and invests in assetbacked debt securities although we generally hold these investments to maturity which generally correlates to the maturities of our customer deposits fluctuations in credit risk could result in impairments among the bank’s fixed income investments and in turn could result in a mismatch between a lower or negative return on our investment portfolio and the interest paid on our customer deposits to the extent that this occurs our assets and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we may elect to pursue growth in the united states and abroad through acquisitions or joint ventures which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations expanding into new jurisdictions and making noncontrolling minority investments in other entities 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities we cannot assure that we will identify and consummate any such transactions on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy in addition any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

we own a 26 investment in uti india and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

we are exposed to a number of risks arising from our international operations 

we operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the united states in addition we have a large investment in uti an indian asset management company our international operations require us to comply with the legal requirements of various foreign jurisdictions and expose us to the political consequences of operating in foreign jurisdictions our foreign business operations are also subject to the following risks 

 

   

page 16 

  

 legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

we are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec the fed and occ in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations such as finra the conduct of our business is in large part dictated by adherence to such regulation including federal laws such as the doddfrank act of 2010 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the usa patriot act of 2001 the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa regulations relating to the mutual fund industry specifically and securities laws generally accounting standards and banking and tax laws compliance with these complex regulations and our disclosure and financial reporting obligations requires significant investments of time and money and could limit our ability to enter into new lines of business further the regulations imposed by one jurisdiction may conflict with the regulations imposed by another and these differences may be difficult or impossible to reconcile 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations for example the volker rule as currently proposed has led us to begin evaluating whether it remains prudent to maintain our savings bank in light of the potential restrictions the rule could place on our other business activities 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden cause a loss of mutual fund investors and reduce our revenues 

as a result of the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 and the significant turmoil in the investment banking banking and financial services industry including the need for government intervention regulators both in and outside the united states have shown increasing interest in the oversight of the broad financial and investment industry some of the newly adopted and proposed regulations are focused directly on the investment management industry while others are more 

  

page 17 

broadly focused but in many cases will impact our industry as well these new laws and regulations can be expected to place greater compliance and administrative burdens on us which likely would increase our expenses without increasing revenues and could adversely impact our business operations in addition new regulations could require the price funds to reduce the level of certain mutual fund fees paid to us or require us to bear additional expenses which would affect our operating results further adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund investment advisory and financial services firms could tarnish the reputation of the financial services industry generally and mutual funds and investment advisers more specifically causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their account balances redemptions would decrease the assets under our management which would reduce our advisory revenues and net income 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been an increase of litigation and in regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot assure that our insurance will cover most liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities each of our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum requirements however a significant operating or investment loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

page 18 

all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism and other causes some of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure a suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption although we have robust business and disaster recovery plans if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology if we are unable to upgrade our technology in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected our systems or our thirdparty service providers’ systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things

revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations 

background 

us equity markets ended 2011 virtually unchanged from the end of 2010 despite experiencing wide trading ranges over the course of the year economic and geopolitical concerns weighed heavily on markets at times during the year and contributed to high volatility the positive momentum in equity markets in late 2010 continued into 2011 as signs of an improving us economy and the release of strong corporate earnings helped lift major indexes by the end of april to new highs not seen since march 2009 equities began to fall in may and continued to decline through the summer as the us and european economies showed signs of weakening the european debt crisis intensified and us congress struggled to reach an agreement on deficit reduction and raising the federal debt ceiling the uncertainties surrounding these macro concerns combined with standard  poor’s downgrade in august of the us government’s longterm sovereign credit rating led investors in search of less risky assets and increased selling pressure on markets through early october volatility in the markets continued through the end of the year despite favorable us economic data as the bipartisan congressional super committee failed to reach a deficit reduction agreement and european leaders failed to develop a concrete plan to address their own debt crisis 

in this volatile environment the global stock indexes produced flat to negative results the sp 500 index of largecap companies in leading industries of the us economy returned 21 in 2011 while the nasdaq composite index which is heavily weighted with technology companies was down 18 excluding dividends and the russell 2000 which generally reflects smaller companies decreased 42 performance for stock markets outside the us was notably worse although a strengthening us dollar decreased the magnitude of the losses in dollar terms in 2011 the msci eafe index which measures the performance of mostly largecap stocks in europe australasia and the far east produced an 117 loss while the msci emerging markets index decreased 182 

despite the sp downgrade treasury yields fell to historic lows in the third quarter of 2011 and prices rose as investors sought the safety of these securities in the wake of the equity market weakness the intensifying european debt crisis and slowing economic growth to support the us economy the federal reserve announced in the third quarter of 2011 that it would keep the federal funds target rate near 0 until at least mid2013 trade shortterm treasury holdings for longerterm issues and resume mortgagebacked security purchases treasury yields ended the year below their levels at the end of 2010 as nervous global investors continued to seek out less risky investments the yield on the benchmark 10year us treasury at december 31 2011 was 19 a decrease of 141 basis points from the end of 2010 

bonds produced positive overall returns in 2011 as strong gains among longterm government bonds compensated for lower returns in other categories municipal and corporate bonds did very well while high yield securities trailed as solid returns in the first half of 2011 were followed by flat performance in the second half of 2011 as investors sought less risky assets 

for 2011 the barclays capital municipal bond index returned 107 the barclays capital us aggregate index gained 78 and the credit suisse high yield index was up 55 a similar trend was seen in the nonus bond markets though the

gains were limited by a stronger us dollar versus other currencies the jp morgan emerging markets index plus gained 92 in 2011 while the barclays capital global aggregate exus dollar bond index was up 44 

assets under management 

with an uncertain and volatile market environment as a backdrop our assets under management increased 75 billion over the course of 2011 and ended the year at 4895 billion net cash inflows from investors in 2011 of 141 billion were partially offset by market depreciation and distributions not reinvested of 66 billion assets under management in billions at the end of the year and changes over the year are detailed below 

 

 our 2009 and 2010 net cash inflows were sourced most significantly from thirdparty financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world whereas net cash flows in 2011 were sourced primarily from thirdparty financial intermediaries our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows to our firm 

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management

results of operations 

in 2011 we changed the presentation of our consolidated statements of income we are presenting distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor r and vip ii classes of our sponsored mutual funds previously included in administrative fees as a separate line to enhance transparency of these fees we also are presenting as a separate line the offsetting distribution and servicing costs previously included in other operating expenses paid to thirdparty financial intermediaries who source those share classes noted above investment income earned by our savings bank subsidiary previously presented on its own is being reported net of interest expense paid on savings bank deposits the line was renamed net revenue of savings bank subsidiary and the details of this line are included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements all amounts for the comparable calendar years have been reclassified to conform to the 2011 presentation 

2011 versus 2010 

investment advisory revenues were up 159 or 3222 million to 23 billion in 2011 as average assets under our management increased 745 billion to 4971 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 473 basis points during 2011 compared to 480 basis points earned in 2010 the decrease in our average annualized fee rate is primarily a result of the 113 million increase in money market management fees voluntarily waived by the firm in order to maintain a positive yield for fund investors the firm waived 364 million in money market fees in 2011 compared to 251 million in 2010 the firm expects that these fee waivers will continue in 2012 

net revenues increased 3799 million or 160 to 27 billion operating expenses were 15 billion in 2011 an increase of 1895 million or 142 overall net operating income for 2011 increased 1904 million or 184 to 12 billion the increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue increased our operating margin for 2011 to 447 from 438 in 2010 net income increased 1010 million or 150 to 7732 million from the 2010 period our diluted earnings per share on our common stock increased 154 to 292 from the 253 earned in 2010 

revenues 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states were 16 billion in 2011 an increase of 153 or 2133 million on higher average mutual fund assets average mutual fund assets in 2011 were 2921 billion an increase of 165 from the 2010 average mutual fund assets at december 31 2011 were 2894 billion up 68 billion from the end of 2010 

net inflows to the mutual funds during 2011 were 110 billion these net inflows include 75 billion that originated in our targetdate retirement funds which in turn invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and automatically rebalance to maintain their specific asset allocation weightings net cash inflows of 66 billion were added to our stock and blended asset funds 39 billion to our bond funds and 5 billion were added to our money market funds the overseas stock international stock new america growth emerging markets stock and new income funds each added more than 12 billion in net inflows for a combined total of 68 billion fund net inflow amounts in 2011 are presented net of 14 billion that was transferred to the other investment portfolios during the year market depreciation and income not reinvested lowered our mutual fund assets under management by 42 billion in 2011 

  

page 26 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 1089 million or 172 to 7414 million average assets in these portfolios were 2050 billion during 2011 an increase of 332 billion or 193 from the 2010 year ending assets at december 31 2011 were 2001 billion an increase of 7 billion from the end of 2010 net inflows into these portfolios in 2011 were 31 billion we experienced strong cash inflows into our subadvised funds from thirdparty intermediaries into our fixed income portfolios from institutional investors and into our other sponsored portfolios during the year these inflows were partially offset by outflows from our equity portfolios by a few institutional investors that were reducing risk in their portfolios in the wake of the volatile market environment experienced in 2011 lower market valuations reduced assets under management in these portfolios by 24 billion 

administrative fees increased 269 million to 3212 million in 2011 the increase is attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor r and vip ii classes of our sponsored mutual funds were 746 million in 2011 an increase of 314 million from 2010 the increase includes 73 million recognized on greater assets under management in these share classes and 241 million earned primarily on r class shares in the last nine months of 2011 for which the comparable 2010 fees were netted against related distribution and servicing costs the 12b1 fees earned are offset entirely by the cost paid to thirdparty intermediaries who source these assets these costs are reported as distribution and servicing costs on the face of the consolidated income statements 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs were 9698 million an increase of 1094 million or 127 compared to 2010 the largest part of the increase is attributable to a 469 million increase in salaries and related benefits which results from a 56 annual increase in our average staff size the 2011 change also includes a 364 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs greater use of outside contractors to meet growing business demands increased our 2011 costs by 112 million the remainder of the change from 2010 is attributable to higher noncash stockbased compensation expense and other employee related costs at december 31 2011 we employed 5255 associates an increase of 40 from the end of 2010 to support both business growth and added capabilities 

advertising and promotion expenditures were 908 million up 39 million or 45 compared to 2010 we currently estimate that advertising and promotion expenditures for 2012 will increase modestly from 2011 levels we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 153 million or 89 versus 2010 the change includes the impact of placing our new technology support facility into service in february 2011 as well as the added costs to update our technology capabilities including related maintenance programs to meet increasing business demands 

  

page 27 

other operating expenses increased 295 million or 175 from 2010 the charitable contribution made to the t rowe price foundation in 2011 was higher than in 2010 and we increased our spending on professional fees information and other thirdparty services and travel to meet increasing business demands the increases in these costs were offset by the 164 million charge incurred in 2010 from the onetime contribution made to certain money market funds that did not reoccur in 2011 

nonoperating investment income 

our nonoperating investment income which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses was down 98 million from the 2010 period this decrease is primarily due to the 2010 period including 76 million in gains realized on the sale of certain mutual fund investments and 22 million recognized in early 2010 on the settlement and valuation of the forward contracts used to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our investment in uti asset management company limited uti the 2011 period includes 64 million in net earnings from our investment in uti an increase of 11 million over the earnings recognized in 2010 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for 2011 is 382 as compared to 372 in 2010 the increase is primarily attributable to higher effective state tax rates as well as greater discrete tax benefits recognized in 2010 from the settlement of state income tax positions and the firm’s international reorganization the firm currently estimates its effective tax rate for 2012 will be about 377 

2010 versus 2009 

investment advisory revenues were up 311 or 4807 million to 20 billion in 2010 as average assets under our management increased 1013 billion to 4226 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 480 basis points during 2010 virtually unchanged from the 481 basis points earned in 2009 including the effect of the voluntary fee waivers made to our money market funds

page 28

administrative fees increased 65 million to 2943 million in 2010 increases in our mutual fund servicing and defined contribution plan revenues of 102 million were offset by a 37 million decrease in brokerage fees due to a reduction in pertrade commissions charged beginning july 1 2010 to customers with substantial assets changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b1 plans of the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares were 432 million in 2010 an increase of 122 million from 2009 we recognized higher fees in 2010 on greater assets under management in these share classes changes in these fees are offset by an equal increase in the distribution and servicing costs paid to those thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute these assets 

operating expenses 

compensation and related costs increased 870 million or 112 compared to 2009 the largest part of the change is attributable to a 639 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs greater use of outside contractors increased our 2010 costs by 141 million with the remainder of the change primarily attributable to higher other employee benefits and employee related costs at december 31 2010 we employed 5052 associates an increase of 52 from the end of 2009 to support both business growth and added capabilities

distribution and servicing costs paid to thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares increased 122 million from 2009 as average assets under management in these classes was greater these costs are offset by an equal increase in our distribution and servicing fees earned from 12b1 plans of these classes as discussed above 

  

page 29 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 41 million or 24 versus 2009 the amount of office space occupied and the operating costs of our facilities have all risen to meet increased business demands these increasing business demands have also led us to upgrade our technology capabilities and related maintenance programs 

other operating expenses increased 479 million or 397 from 2009 this increase includes a 164 million charge related to the onetime contribution made to certain money market funds to offset the effects of cumulative net losses realized in recent years the remainder of the increase relates to higher consulting fees travel costs and other professional services incurred to meet increasing business demands

page 30 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1650 million down 1119 million from the 2010 period cash flows in 2010 included 1436 million in cash used to purchase our 26 equity interest in uti we spent 357 million less in property and equipment expenditures in 2011 compared to 2010 due to the construction of our technology support facility being substantially complete at the end of 2010 these reductions in cash used in 2011 were offset by an increase of 570 million in net investments made into our sponsored mutual funds compared to the 2010 period 

net cash used in financing activities was 6986 million in 2011 up 3125 million from the 2010 period we increased our stock repurchases by expending 2397 million more in 2011 compared to the 2010 year dividends paid during 2011 increased 390 million from the 2010 period due primarily to a 04 increase in our quarterly pershare dividend the impact of dividends paid and stock repurchases was greater in 2011 as proceeds related to our stockbased compensation plans decreased 478 million on reduced exercise activity 

2010 versus 2009  

operating activities during 2010 provided cash flows of 7328 million up 1972 million from 2009 including a 2386 million increase in net income cash flows in 2009 also included the impact of 361 million in other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds that did not recur in 2010 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2769 million up 1102 million from the 2009 period primarily from the purchase of a 26 equity interest in uti for 1424 million plus related transaction costs incurred in the 2010 period of 12 million we spent 159 million less in property and equipment expenditures in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the construction of our two new facilities in owings mills maryland being completed in late 2009 

net cash used in financing activities was 3861 million in 2010 up 1414 million from the 2009 period we increased our stock repurchases by expending 1690 million more in 2010 compared to the 2009 year dividends paid during 2010 increased 220 million from the 2009 period due primarily to a 02 increase in our quarterly pershare dividend these uses of cash were offset by 353 million more in cash proceeds from option exercises compared to 2009 as the higher market valuations of our common stock experienced in 2010 led employees to exercise 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2011 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2012 and future years the information also excludes the 47 million of uncertain tax positions discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 

  

page 31 

 we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment totaling 425 million at december 31 2011 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2011 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

other than temporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as availableforsale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

in determining whether a mutual fund holding is other than temporarily impaired we consider many factors including the duration of time it has existed the severity of the impairment any subsequent changes in value and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair value subject to the other considerations noted above with respect to duration of time we believe a mutual fund holding with an unrealized loss that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost minor impairments of 5 or less are generally considered temporary 

  

page 32 

other than temporary impairments of equity method investments  we evaluate our equity method investments including our investment in uti for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in fair value is other than temporary 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit – our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet 6657 million 

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes optionpricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject 

  

page 33 

to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance 

in may 2011 the fasb issued amended guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value we do not believe the adoption of such amended guidance on january 1 2012 will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we have also considered all other newly issued accounting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements including that which we have not yet adopted we do not believe that any such guidance will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operation

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and

could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income loss will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments changes in their market valuations and any other than temporary impairments that may arise or in the case of our equity method investments our proportionate share of the investee’s net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill or other asset impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at yearend using each fund’s lowest net asset value per share during 2011 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all funds experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

 

 the comparable potential loss of value presented in our 2010 annual report was 1091 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 7479 million during 2011 we actually experienced net unrealized losses of 402 million 

  

page 35 

because our fund holdings are considered availableforsale securities we recognize unrealized losses that are considered temporary in other comprehensive income we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating investment income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 

we also hold other investments of 2063 million at december 31 2011 including our 1448 million equity investment in uti given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount in addition our investment in uti exposes us to foreign currency risk related to translating our proportionate share of their financial statements which are denominated in indian rupees inr to us dollarsusd each reporting period we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this foreign currency risk so both positive and negative fluctuations in the inr against the usd will affect accumulated other comprehensive income and the carrying amount of our investment our cumulative translation loss net of tax at december 31 2011 was 56 million 

we operate in several foreign countries of which the united kingdom is the most prominent we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in usd we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

 item 1 business 

t rowe price group is a financial services holding company that derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

the late thomas rowe price jr began our advisory business in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000 

we operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies primarily t rowe price associates inc t rowe price international inc and t rowe price global investment services limited following the close of business on december 31 2010 we completed an international reorganization to realize additional operational efficiencies whereby all our international operations were consolidated under one entity t rowe price global investment services limited as part of the reorganization the operations of our existing hong kong and singapore branches were transferred to two newly incorporated investment advisers t rowe price hong kong limited and t rowe price singapore private ltd we also dissolved t rowe price international inc and renamed t rowe price global investment services limited to t rowe price international ltd 

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base across four primary distribution channels thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and other countries individual us investors on a direct basis us defined contribution retirement plans and institutional investors in the us and other countries 

we manage a broad range of us and international stock blended asset bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors mutual fund shareholders can exchange balances among mutual funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change 

from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund or investment portfolio if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund or investment mandate in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing fund shareholders and investors at present the following funds are closed to all new investors 

 

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus investment management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global or international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity and asset allocation investment strategies including target retirementdate investment portfolios as well as active systematic and municipal taxfree management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities received from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector 

 2  

  our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the united states and england with additional staff resident in argentina hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling 

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the t rowe price complex brokerage and trust services approximately 90 of our administrative revenues in 2010 were determined based generally on the recovery of our related costs to provide the administrative services changes in our administrative revenues and related expenses therefore do not significantly affect our net operating income or net income 

information concerning our revenues results of operations and total assets and our investment assets under management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial statements and in note 2 thereto which are both included in item 8 of this form 10k 

2010 developments total assets under our management increased 907 billion over the course of 2010 and ended the year at a record 4820 billion a substantial recovery from the 2763 billion at the end of 2008 and an increase of 21 from the previous record yearend high of 4000 billion at the end of 2007 our yearend assets under management include 3606 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 1214 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the investment portfolios that we manage consist of 2826 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1994 billion in other investment portfolios including separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us retirement accounts and variable annuity investment portfolios account for 2933 billion of our yearend assets under management nonus dollar denominated securities account for about 70 billion of the total 

the firm’s longterm investment advisory results relative to our peers remain very strong with 86 of the t rowe price funds across their share classes surpassing their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the threeyear period ended december 31 2010 88 outperforming for the fiveyear period 84 outperforming for the 10year period and 74 outperforming for the oneyear period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that ended the quarter with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar account for more than 70 of our rated funds’ assets under management 

our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows of 303 billion to our management in 2010 thirdparty financial intermediaries institutional investors around the world and our targetdate retirement portfolios were the most significant sources of these net inflows market appreciation and income added 604 billion in 2010 

assets under management in our targetdate retirement portfolios increased nearly 36 or 157 billion during 2010 to total 594 billion or 12 of our managed assets at yearend 

six price funds — growth stock equity income midcap growth blue chip growth value and capital appreciation — accounted for 25 of our investment advisory revenues in 2010 and 21 of our assets under management at december 31 2010 

our international clients account for 125 of our total assets under management at december 31 2010 up from nearly 12 at the beginning of the year 

on january 20 2010 we completed the purchase of a 26 equity interest in uti asset management company and an affiliate from existing stockholders for 65 billion indian rupees inr or 1424 million plus transaction costs of 32 million of which a portion was paid in 2009 we repurchased 50 million shares of our common stock for 240 million in 2010 we funded the investment in uti and the share repurchases with existing cash balances and cash generated from operations 

 3  

  we made a onetime contribution of 164 million in november 2010 to certain of our sponsored money market mutual funds to offset the effect of cumulative net losses realized by those funds in past years in order to allay any fund shareholder concerns that might arise because of new sec disclosure rules the charge associated with this onetime contribution is included in other operating expenses 

see the background section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report for more information on the 2010 market environment in which we operated 

price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

advisory services investment advisory revenues are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund additional revenues are earned for advisoryrelated administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee rate for the majority of the price funds the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group rate that is set based on the aggregate net assets of nearly all of the price funds and an individual fund rate that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective 

the effective group rate when combined net assets exceed 220 billion is calculated based on a weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers of 300 basis points for the first 220 billion of net assets plus 285 basis points for net assets in excess of 220 billion to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of a fund’s advisory fee rate and therefore the advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease each individual fund charge for four of our five largest funds — growth stock midcap growth equity income and blue chip growth — is a weighted average determined by applying a 15 reduction for net assets in excess of 15 billion to the base individual fund rate 

our calendaryear 2010 fees determined in the above manner for stock and bond funds that incurred advisory fees of at least 5 million in 2010 varied from a low of 40 basis points for the taxfree shortintermediate and maryland taxfree bond funds to a high of 105 basis points for the emerging europe  mediterranean international discovery latin america and emerging markets stock funds details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

several of the price funds including the index and summit funds instead have individual advisory fees or single allinclusive fees that cover both investment management and ordinary operating expenses each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest mutual funds for institutional investors each have a separate advisory fee arrangement 

because of the low interest rate environment continuing throughout 2010 we voluntarily waived money market advisory fees of 251 million to maintain a zero or positive yield for fund investors we began waiving our money market advisory fees during the second half of 2009 and anticipate these fee waivers will continue into 2011 these 2010 fee waivers lowered the money market advisory fee rates from a low of five basis points for the us treasury money and california taxfree money funds to a high of 28 basis points for the summit cash reserves fund 

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios 

 4  

  certain of the price funds also offer advisor and r classes of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the price funds and enters into agreements with each intermediary payment of 12b1 fees is made by each fund directly to the applicable intermediaries 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding administrative revenue in our consolidated statement of income we also recognize as part of our other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income the corresponding payment of these fees from each fund to the thirdparty financial intermediaries the revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third party intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of the selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in the print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including enhancements to our website 

administrative services we provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds through our subsidiaries t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities and technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the price funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the funds 

our trustee services are provided by another subsidiary t rowe price trust company through this marylandchartered limitedservice trust company we offer common trust funds for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for retirement plans and iras t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans another subsidiary t rowe price savings bank issues federally insured certificates of deposit 

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals 

fund assets at december 31 2010 assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 2826 billion an increase of 214 or 499 billion from the beginning of the year the following table presents the net assets in billions of our largest funds net assets in excess of 7 billion at december 31 and the year each fund was started the spectrum and retirement series of funds are not presented in the table because their assets are already included in their underlying fund holdings

 6  

  other investment portfolios we managed 1994 billion at december 31 2010 in other client investment portfolios up 408 billion from the beginning of the year 

we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios such as common trust funds luxembourgbased mutual funds and variable annuity life insurance plans at december 31 these portfolios included the following investment assets 

 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management in 2010 49 of these advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations the balance of our managed investment portfolios are generally billed quarterly with monthend average values during the billing period and end of billing period values accounting for 30 and 20 respectively of our 2010 revenues 

we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded 

our largest client account relationship outside the t rowe price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 3 of our investment advisory revenues in 2010

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from timetotime in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

• investor mobility our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time on very short notice and without any significant penalty 

• general market declines a downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management 

• investment performance if the investment performance of our managed portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable thirdparty benchmarks we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management institutional investors in particular consider changing investment advisers based upon poor relative investment performance individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance 

• global economies national and international political and economic events may cause financial market declines that lower the value of assets under our management and may cause investors to withdraw funds 

• investing trends changes in investing trends and in particular retirement savings trends including the prevalence of defined contribution retirement plans may reduce interest in our funds and portfolios and may alter our mix of assets under management 

• interest rate changes investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates 

• tax regulation changes changes in the status of tax deferred retirement plan investments and taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates and regulations could adversely affect investor behavior and may cause investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60day notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income

  we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

• asset management firms 

• mutual fund companies 

• commercial banks and thrift institutions 

• insurance companies 

• hedge funds 

• exchange traded funds 

• brokerage and investment banking firms and 

• other financial institutions including multinational firms and subsidiaries of diversified conglomerates 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them we believe that competition within the investment management industry will intensify as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income if we are required to lower our fees in order to remain competitive our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed especially over shorter periods of time and others may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts management and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

certain of the price funds and other investment portfolios are vulnerable to marketspecific risks that could adversely affect investment performance our reputation and our revenues 

several of the price funds and investment portfolios for example emerging market investments are subject to political and economic instability wide exchangerate fluctuations illiquid and highly volatile markets and other risks that could materially decrease the investment returns available in foreign markets a significant decrease in the investment return or net asset value of any price fund or investment portfolio could harm our reputation and cause a decrease in assets under management including client asset withdrawals the result could be a material decline in our revenues and net income 

the performance of our money market funds is dependent on the income from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund when interest rates are at the historic lows that presently exist the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolio’s income and reduce the yield of the funds to very low levels in 2010 and presently such an environment has caused us to waive a portion of our advisory fees on money market funds in order to maintain yields at or above 0 to fund investors such actions reduce our advisory fee income and net income also bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds have and could continue to experience redemptions client losses decrease our revenues and net income 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse affect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties and litigation 

operating risks include 

• failure to properly perform fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities including portfolio accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations 

• failure to properly perform transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities including transaction processing supervision of staff tax reporting and record retention and failure to identify excessive trading in mutual funds by our customers or plan participants 

 9  

  • sales and marketing risks including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of products and services in advertising materials public relations information or other external communications and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

• changes in the level of our advertising expenses including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the united states and further penetrating us distribution channels 

• variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants and other stockbased awards changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes changes in our employee count and mix competitive factors and inflation 

• a future impairment of our investment in uti 

• a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our balance sheet 

• unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad 

• expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development 

• unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill and 

• disruptions of thirdparty services such as communications power and mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

under our agreements with the t rowe price mutual funds we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

more than 30 of our assets under management are sourced from our largest distribution channel thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and abroad these intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on third party financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third party intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

• decreasing investment valuations in and returns on the investment portfolios that we manage 

• causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive 

• incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our associates 

• interrupting our business operations 

• triggering technology delays or failures and 

• requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage replace our facilities and restore our operations 

 10  

  we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to continue our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in our stock blended asset and bond mutual funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

the investment performance of our savings bank subsidiary could adversely affect our assets and results of operations 

we have a savings bank subsidiary that accepts time deposits from customers pays a fixed rate of interest to them and invests in assetbacked debt securities although we generally hold these investments to maturity which generally correlates to the maturities of our customer deposits fluctuations in credit risk could result in impairments among the bank’s fixed income investments and in turn could result in a mismatch between a lower or negative return on our investment portfolio and the interest paid on our customer deposits to the extent that this occurs our assets and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we may elect to pursue growth in the united states and abroad through acquisitions or joint ventures which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations expanding into new jurisdictions and making noncontrolling minority investments in other entities 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities we cannot assure that we will identify and consummate any such transactions on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy in addition any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

in january 2010 we completed the acquisition of a 26 investment in uti asset management company india and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop in the future 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

we are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in the united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations such as finra the conduct of our business is in large part dictated by adherence to such regulation including federal laws such as the doddfrank act of 2010 the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the usa patriot act of 2001 the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa regulations relating to the mutual fund industry specifically and securities laws generally accounting standards and banking and tax laws compliance with these complex regulations and our disclosure and financial reporting obligations requires significant investments of time and money and could limit our ability to enter into new lines of business further the regulations imposed by one jurisdiction may conflict with the regulations imposed by another and these differences may be difficult or impossible to reconcile 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

 11  

  legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden cause a loss of mutual fund investors and reduce our revenues 

as a result of the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 and the significant turmoil in the investment banking banking and financial services industry including the need for government intervention regulators both in and outside the united states have shown increasing interest in the oversight of the broad financial and investment industry some of the newly adopted and proposed regulations are focused directly on the investment management industry while others are more broadly focused but in many cases will impact our industry as well these new laws and regulations can be expected to place greater compliance and administrative burdens on us which likely would increase our expenses without increasing revenues and could adversely impact our business operations in addition new regulations could require the price funds to reduce the level of certain mutual fund fees paid to us or require us to bear additional expenses which would affect our operating results further adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund investment advisory and financial services firms could tarnish the reputation of the financial services industry generally and mutual funds and investment advisers more specifically causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their account balances redemptions would decrease the assets under our management which would reduce our advisory revenues and net income 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot assure that our insurance will cover most liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum requirements however a significant operating or investment loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

• securities analysis 

• securities trading 

• portfolio management 

• customer service 

• accounting and internal financial processes and controls and 

• regulatory compliance and reporting 

 12  

  all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism and other causes some of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure a suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology if we are unable to upgrade our technology in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected our systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things 

• seriously damage our reputation 

• allow competitors access to our proprietary business information 

• subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data 

• result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers 

• subject us to regulatory action and 

• require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios investment advisory clients outside the united states account for 125 of our assets under management at december 31 2010 

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations 

on january 20 2010 we purchased a 26 equity interest in uti asset management company and an affiliate from existing stockholders for 65 billion indian rupees inr or 1424 million plus transaction costs of 32 million of which a portion was paid in 2009 we repurchased 50 million shares of our common stock for 2400 million in 2010 we funded the investment in uti and the share repurchases with existing cash balances and cash generated from operations 

the low interest rate environment experienced in 2010 led us to continue voluntarily waiving money market advisory fees to maintain a zero or positive yield for fund investors we waived 251 million in 2010 compared to 57 million in 2009 and anticipate these fee waivers will continue into 2011 

we made a onetime contribution of 164 million in november 2010 to certain of our sponsored money market mutual funds to offset the effect of cumulative net losses realized by those funds in past years in order to allay any fund shareholder concerns that might arise because of new sec disclosure rules the charge associated with this onetime contribution is included in other operating expenses

  background 

against a backdrop of healthy earnings strong balance sheets and low borrowing costs for corporations major us equity indexes rose strongly in 2010 capping a second consecutive year of solid gains stocks produced robust returns through late april extending the rally that started in march 2009 but fell sharply through early july due in part to concern around the european sovereign debt crisis a sluggish us economic recovery and the “flash crash” in us stock prices on may 6 equities rebounded strongly beginning in late august as the economy showed signs of improvement and the federal reserve gave reassurance that they would employ nontraditional monetary policy tools as needed to promote economic recovery the market continued to rally through the fourth quarter as the federal reserve proved their willingness to act by initiating a second round of quantitative easing since the 2008 financial crisis they announced plans to purchase an additional 600 billion in treasuries by mid2011 in an attempt to keep longerterm interest rates low bipartisan legislation in middecember that extended for two years the bushera tax cuts that were set to expire at the end of 2010 helped lift major indexes to their highest levels of the year 

in this environment the sp 500 index of largecap companies in leading industries of the us economy returned 151 in 2010 while the nasdaq composite index which is heavily weighted with technology companies returned 169 excluding dividends 

the returns in developed nonus equity markets were mixed as strong asian market performance was offset by weaker results in europe where markets struggled with concerns over the sovereign debt crisis as developed markets dealt with economic pressures emerging equity markets produced strong returns with countries in the emerging europe middle east and africa emea regions faring the best the msci emerging markets index returned 192 versus 82 for the msci eafe index which measures the performance of mostly largecap stocks in europe australasia and the far east 

the federal reserve’s target funds rate remained in the range of 000 to 025 throughout 2010 where it has been since late 2008 this historically low rate along with the slowdown in the economy during the spring and the european debt crisis placed strong downward pressure on treasury yields as investors sought the safety of treasuries treasury yields began to rise in late fall in response to the federal reserve’s additional stimulus and a stronger economic climate but most of the yield curve ended the year still below their levels at the end of 2009 the yield on the benchmark 10year us treasury at december 31 2010 was 33 a decrease of 55 basis points from the end of 2009 

us fixed income securities realized modest gains in 2010 high yield bonds significantly outperformed investmentgrade issues as investors sought higher returns in the low interest rate environment the credit suisse high yield index gained 144 in 2010 while the barclays capital us aggregate index gained 65 a similar trend was seen in the nonus bond markets as investors sought riskier bonds issued by emerging market countries over the highquality bonds issued in developed markets the jp morgan emerging markets index plus gained 118 in 2010 while the barclays capital global aggregate exus dollar bond index was up 50 

in this environment investors entrusted net inflows of 303 billion to our management in 2010 total assets under our management increased 907 billion over the course of 2010 and ended the year at a record 4820 billion a substantial recovery from the 2763 billion at the end of 2008 and an increase of 21 from the previous record yearend high of 4000 billion at the end of 2007 our assets under management in billions have changed during the past three years as follows 

 

over the last three years our net cash inflows have been sourced most significantly from thirdparty financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows across each of our four distribution channels 

 16  

  assets under management at december 31 2010 include 3606 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 1214 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the investment portfolios that we manage consist of 2826 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1994 billion in other investment portfolios including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts may often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management 

results of operations 

2010 versus 2009 investment advisory revenues were up 311 or 4807 million to 20 billion in 2010 as average assets under our management increased 1013 billion to 4226 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 480 basis points during 2010 virtually unchanged from the 481 basis points earned in 2009 including the effect of the voluntary fee waivers made to our money market funds 

net revenues increased 4998 million or 268 to nearly 24 billion operating expenses were 13 billion in 2010 an increase of 1649 million or 141 this increase includes the 164 million charge related to the onetime contribution made to certain of our money market funds overall net operating income for 2010 increased 3349 million or 477 to more than 10 billion the increase in our average assets under management and resulting advisory revenue increased our operating margin for 2010 to 438 from 376 for 2009 we recognized nonoperating investment income of 335 million in 2010 compared to investment losses in 2009 of 127 million the 2009 year included 361 million in other than temporary impairment charges recognized in the first quarter on our investments in sponsored mutual funds net income increased 2386 million or 55 to 6722 million from the 2009 period resulting in diluted earnings per share on our common stock to increase 53 to 253 from the 165 earned in 2009 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 305 or 3260 million to nearly 14 billion average mutual fund assets in 2010 were 2508 billion an increase of 308 from the 2009 average 

net inflows to the mutual funds during 2010 were 136 billion including 59 billion originating in our targetdate retirement funds fund net inflow amounts are presented net of 10 billion that was transferred to our targetdate retirement trusts from the retirement funds our bond funds had net inflows of 77 billion the new income fund had net inflows of 22 billion and the shortterm bond fund added 14 billion the stock and blended asset funds added 63 billion of net inflows including 14 billion into the value fund the midcap value equity income institutional largecap growth and dividend growth funds each added more than 500 million for a combined total of 22 billion in net inflows the money market funds had net outflows of 400 million higher market valuations and income increased fund assets by 363 billion 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 1547 million or 324 to 6325 million average assets in these portfolios were 1718 billion during 2010 an increase of 423 billion or 327 from the 2009 year net inflows primarily from institutional investors and third party financial intermediaries were 167 billion while market appreciation and income added 241 billion these net inflows were invested primarily in our equity mandates though we also saw strong demand for our fixed income strategies net inflows include a transfer of 10 billion from the targetdate retirement funds 

administrative fees increased 187 million to 3375 million in 2010 the change in these revenues includes a 122 million increase of 12b1 distribution and service fees recognized on higher assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual funds increases in our mutual fund servicing and defined contribution plan revenues of 102 million were offset by a 37 million decrease in brokerage fees due to a reduction in pertrade commissions charged beginning july 1 2010 to customers with substantial assets changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

compensation and related costs increased 870 million or 112 compared to 2009 the largest part of the change is attributable to a 639 million increase in our annual variable compensation programs greater use of outside contractors increased our 2010 costs by 141 million with the remainder of the change primarily attributable to higher other employee benefits and employee related costs at december 31 2010 we employed 5052 associates an increase of 52 from the end of 2009 to support both business growth and added capabilities

  advertising and promotion expenditures were up 137 million or 187 compared to 2009 in response to investor interest in recovering markets over the last twelve months we currently estimate that advertising and promotion expenditures for 2011 could increase about 15 from 2010 levels we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base globally 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 41 million or 24 versus 2009 the amount of office space occupied and the operating costs of our facilities have all risen to meet increased business demands these increasing business demands have also led us to upgrade our technology capabilities and related maintenance programs 

other operating expenses increased 601 million or 396 from 2009 this increase includes a 164 million charge related to the onetime contribution made to certain money market funds to offset the effects of cumulative net losses realized in recent years higher average assets in 2010 increased the distribution and service expense of our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares that are sourced from financial intermediaries these costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b1 fees discussed above the remaining increase is a result of other operating costs including consulting fees travel costs and other professional services incurred to meet increasing business demands 

our nonoperating investment income activity resulted in a net gain of 335 million in 2010 compared to a net loss of 127 million in the 2009 period this change of 462 million includes 361 million in other than temporary impairments recognized on our investments in sponsored mutual funds in 2009 the change also includes 13 million in more gains recognized in the 2010 period for the settlement and valuation of a series of nondeliverable forward contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with the uti acquisition price and 53 million in net earnings from our investment in uti 

the 2010 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 372 the 2010 income tax provision includes nonrecurring discrete benefits of 4 related to the settlement of prior years state income tax positions and 2 from the firm’s reorganization of its international entities which was completed to help realize additional operational efficiencies the firm currently estimates its effective rate for 2011 will be about 378 

2009 versus 2008  investment advisory revenues were down 12 or 215 million to more than 15 billion in 2009 as average assets under our management of 3213 billion in 2009 were 369 billion lower than in 2008 the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 481 basis points during 2009 down from the 492 basis points earned during 2008 lower equity market valuations resulted in an increase in the percentage of our assets under management being attributable to lower fee fixed income portfolios including money market funds for which we reduced advisory fees in order to maintain yields at or above 0 to fund investors 

net revenues decreased 12 or 249 million to nearly 19 billion operating expenses fell 8 or 102 million to almost 12 billion in 2009 overall net operating income in 2009 decreased 147 million or 17 to 702 million our operating margin declined to 376 in 2009 from 401 in 2008 as the impact of lower average market valuations over 2009 which decreased our assets under management and corresponding advisory revenues was offset only partially by the savings from our cost reduction efforts our nonoperating investment loss decreased nearly 40 million due to the higher other than temporary impairment charges recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds net income fell 12 or 57 million to nearly 434 million diluted earnings per share on our common stock also decreased to 165 down 9 or 16 from 181 in 2008 the retrospective application in 2009 of new financial reporting guidance that recognizes our outstanding restricted stock and stock units on which we pay nonforfeitable dividends as if they were a separate class of stock reduced previously reported 2008 diluted earnings per share on our common stock of 182 by 01 per share the nonoperating charges to recognize other than temporary impairments of our fund investments reduced diluted earnings per share by 21 in 2008 and 09 in 2009 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states decreased more than 170 million or 14 from 2008 to almost 11 billion average mutual fund assets were 1918 billion in 2009 down 11 from the average of 2161 billion during 2008 net inflows to the mutual funds in 2009 were 125 billion including 64 billion that originated from our targetdate retirement funds our bond funds added 100 billion of net inflows including 63 billion from four funds — new income short term bond international bond and emerging markets bond — that each added more than 1 billion during the year the stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of 48 billion after the transfer of 13 billion to other investment portfolios under our management the equity index 500 and midcap growth funds had total net inflows of 25 billion in 2009 our money market funds had net outflows of 23 billion during the year higher market valuations and income increased mutual fund assets under management by 558 billion in 2009

 18  

  investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage decreased 44 million or 85 to 4778 million in 2009 average assets in these portfolios were 1295 billion during 2009 down 126 billion or 9 from 2008 other investment portfolio assets under management increased 467 billion during 2009 including 365 billion in market gains and income and 102 billion of net inflows primarily from institutional investors net inflows include 13 billion transferred from the stock and blended asset mutual funds during 2009 

administrative fees decreased 35 million or 10 to 319 million in 2009 this change includes a 4 million decrease in 12b1 distribution and service fees recognized on lower average assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual funds and a 31 million reduction in our mutual fund servicing revenue which is primarily attributable to our cost reduction efforts in the mutual fund and retirement plan servicing functions changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

our largest expense compensation and related costs decreased 42 million or 5 from 2008 to 773 million in 2009 the largest part of this decrease is attributable to a 19 million reduction in our annual bonus program reductions in the use of outside contractors lowered 2009 costs 14 million with the remainder of the cost savings primarily attributable to the workforce reduction and lower employee benefits and other employment expenses average headcount in 2009 was down 54 from 2008 due to attrition retirements and our workforce reduction in april 2009 

advertising and promotion expenditures were down 31 million or 30 versus 2008 due to our decision to reduce spending in response to lower investor activity in the 2009 market environment 

depreciation expense and other occupancy and facility costs together increased 4 million or 25 compared to 2008 as we moderated or delayed our capital spending and facility growth plans 

other operating expenses decreased 33 million or 18 from 2008 including a decline of 4 million in distribution and service expenses recognized on lower average assets under management in our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares that are sourced from financial intermediaries our cost control efforts resulted in the remaining expense reductions including lower professional fees and travel and related costs 

our nonoperating investment activity resulted in net losses of 127 million in 2009 and 523 million in 2008 the improvement of nearly 40 million is primarily attributable to a reduction in the other than temporary impairments recognized on our investments in sponsored mutual funds in 2009 versus 2008 the following table details our related mutual fund investment gains and losses in millions during the two years ended december 31 2009 

 

lower income of 16 million from our money market holdings due to the significantly lower interest rate environment offset the improvement experienced with our fund investments 

the 2009 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 371 down from 384 in 2008 our 2009 provision includes reductions of prior years’ tax provisions and discrete nonrecurring benefits that lowered our 2009 effective tax rate by 10 

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2010 stockholders’ equity increased from 29 billion to 33 billion we repurchased nearly 50 million common shares for 2400 million in 2010 tangible book value is 26 billion at december 31 2010 and our cash and cash equivalents and our mutual fund investment holdings total more than 15 billion given the availability of these financial resources we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity 

 19  

  at december 31 2010 we had outstanding commitments to make additional contributions totaling 482 million to various investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment we presently anticipate funding 2011 property and equipment expenditures of about 120 million from our cash balances and operating cash inflows 

2010 versus 2009  operating activities during 2010 provided cash flows of 7328 million up 1972 million from 2009 including a 2386 million increase in net income cash flows in 2009 also included the impact of 361 million in other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds that did not recur in 2010 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2769 million up 1102 million from the 2009 period primarily from the purchase of a 26 equity interest in uti for 1424 million plus related transaction costs incurred in the 2010 period of 12 million we spent 159 million less in property and equipment expenditures in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the construction of our two new facilities in owings mills maryland being completed in late 2009 

net cash used in financing activities was 3861 million in 2010 up 1414 million from the 2009 period we increased our stock repurchases by expending 1690 million more in 2010 compared to the 2009 year dividends paid during 2010 increased 220 million from the 2009 period due primarily to a 02 increase in our quarterly pershare dividend these uses of cash are offset by 353 million more in cash proceeds from option exercises compared to 2009 as the higher market valuations of our common stock experienced in 2010 led employees to exercise 

2009 versus 2008  operating activities during 2009 provided cash flows of nearly 536 million down 206 million from 2008 including a 57 million decrease in net income and a 129 million change in the timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues and payables and accrued liabilities in addition our add back of the noncash charges for other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds was 55 million more in 2008 than in 2009 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 167 million in 2009 up 42 million from 2008 we made net investments of nearly 18 million into our mutual fund portfolio in 2009 an increase of 15 million from 2008 during 2009 and 2008 we made several changes totaling more than 56 million in 2009 and 95 million in 2008 to the composition of our portfolio of mutual fund holdings in light of market conditions experienced during the period because of the smaller 2009 increase in savings bank deposits we increased our investment in debt securities held by the savings bank by only 9 million in 2009 versus 41 million in 2008 in 2008 we liquidated our 70 million us treasury notes portfolio thereby producing inflows of nearly 73 million that did not recur in 2009 

net cash used in financing activities was 245 million in 2009 down 538 million from 2008 compared to 2008 we expended 543 million less to repurchase our common shares in 2009 the uncertain market environment in 2009 led us to reduce our share repurchases and preserve our liquid capital our 01 per share quarterly dividend increase in 2009 accounts for an additional payout of 10 million in dividends however our 2008 change in policy regarding the timing of dividend payments such that our quarterly dividends are declared and paid in the same quarter resulted in five quarterly dividend payments in 2008 versus only four in 2009 this additional payment resulted in our 2009 outflows for dividends decreasing 64 million from 2008 excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation plans decreased 37 million as fewer stock option exercises due to uncertainties and lower market valuations of our common stock reduced our common stock issuances about 25 from 2008 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2010 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2011 and future years the information also excludes the 4 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 

 

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional contributions to investment partnerships in which we have an existing investment totaling 482 million at december 31 2010 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

 20  

  we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2010 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

other than temporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as availableforsale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

a mutual fund holding with an impairment that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an otherthantemporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost minor impairments of 5 or less are generally considered temporary 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit — our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet 6657 million 

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes optionpricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance 

each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted accounting and reporting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements we do not believe that any issued guidance that we have not yet adopted will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

 21  

  forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to our revenues net income and earnings per share on common stock changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels our estimated effective income tax rate and our expectations regarding financial markets future transactions investments capital expenditures and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k annual report further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income loss will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments and changes in their market valuations or in the case of our equity investments our proportionate share of their net income 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 

 22  

  


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management accordingly declines in financial market values like those experienced during periods in 2008 and 2009 directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues as well as our investment income and net income 

we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive financial instruments primarily for purposes other than trading mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

upon the closing of our equity purchase of uti we also settled the series of rolling nondeliverable forward contracts used to economically hedge the foreign currency exchange rate exposure relating to the acquisition price we did not invest in any other derivative financial or commodity instruments in 2010 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at yearend using each fund’s lowest net asset value per share during 2010 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all funds experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

 

the comparable potential loss of value presented in our 2009 annual report was 2072 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 6775 million during 2010 we actually experienced net unrealized gains of 679 million 

because our fund holdings are considered availableforsale securities we recognize unrealized losses that are considered temporary in other comprehensive income we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating investment income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary a mutual fund holding with an impairment that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption the amount and timing of any future charge will be dependent on our holdings and future market performance 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 

we also hold other investments of 2097 million including our 1541 million investment in uti asset management company ltd at december 31 2010 given the nature of uti’s business should conditions deteriorate in markets in which they operate we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount 

we operate in several foreign countries most prominent among which is the united kingdom we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in us dollars we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund or investment portfolio if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund or investment mandate in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing fund shareholders and investors at present the following funds are closed to all new investors 

 

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus investment management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global or international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity and asset allocation investment strategies including target retirementdate investment portfolios as well as active systematic and municipal taxfree management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities received from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the united states and great britain with additional staff resident in argentina hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds discount brokerage and trust services approximately 90 of our administrative revenues in 2009 were determined based generally on the recovery of our related costs to provide the administrative services changes in our administrative revenues and related expenses therefore do not significantly affect our net operating income or net income 

information concerning our revenues results of operations and total assets and our investment assets under management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial statements and in note 2 thereto which are both included in item 8 of this form 10k

  2009 developments total assets under our management ended 2009 at 3913 billion a substantial recovery from 2763 billion at the end of 2008 to a level approaching the historical periodend high of 4000 billion at december 31 2007 retirement accounts and variable annuity investment portfolios account for 2490 billion of the total our yearend assets under management include 2904 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 1009 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the investment portfolios that we manage consist of 2327 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1586 billion in other investment portfolios including separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us nonus dollar denominated securities account for about 55 billion of our yearend assets under management 

six price funds — growth stock equity income midcap growth blue chip growth value and capital appreciation — accounted for 26 of our investment advisory revenues in 2009 and 21 of our assets under management at december 31 2009 

our international clients account for nearly 12 of our total assets under management at december 31 2009 up from nearly 10 at the beginning of the year 

the firm’s longterm investment advisory results relative to our peers remain strong with 89 of the t rowe price funds across their share classes surpassing their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2009 at least 79 outperforming the average for the three and 10year periods and 73 outperforming for the oneyear period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that ended the quarter with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar account for more than 73 of our rated funds’ assets under management 

our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows of 227 billion to our management in 2009 including 147 billion that originated during the second half of the year as financial markets were recovering higher market valuations and income added 923 billion in 2009 

while we are always vigilant in controlling our operating expenses we began a series of cost reduction and avoidance initiatives in late 2007 to get ahead of deteriorating market conditions these efforts were heightened through the last two years especially with the equity market’s steep decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 and included a 55 reduction of our workforce in april 2009 overall our 2009 operating expenses were 102 million less than in 2008 and 66 million lower than in 2007 

on january 20 2010 we completed the previously announced acquisition of a 26 equity interest in uti asset management company and an affiliate from existing stockholders for 65 billion indian rupees or 1424 million plus transaction costs of about 35 million uti asset management company is an unlisted company in india with approximately 178 billion in average assets under management in december 2009 we will account for this investment using the equity method of accounting 

see the background section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report for more information on the 2009 market environment in which we operated 

price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

advisory services investment advisory revenues are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund additional revenues are earned for advisoryrelated administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is generally computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee rate for the majority of the price funds the fee is equal to the sum of an individual fund charge that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective and a group charge that is set based on the aggregate net assets of those funds 

the individual fund charge for each of our four largest funds — growth stock equity income midcap growth and blue chip growth – is a weighted average determined by applying a 15 reduction for net assets in excess of 15 billion to the base individual fund rate the group charge is derived from a tiered fee schedule the effective group charge when combined net assets exceed 220 billion is calculated based on a weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers of nearly 305 basis points for the first 220 billion of net assets plus 285 basis points for net assets in excess of 220 billion to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of a fund’s advisory fee rate and therefore the advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease near zero percent yields on very shortterm securities in 2009 significantly reduced the yield on money market funds across the mutual fund industry as a result we voluntarily reduced our money market advisory fees during the second half of 2009 in order to maintain yields at or above 0 to fund investors these fee reductions are continuing presently into 2010 

our calendaryear 2009 fees determined in the above manner for funds that incurred advisory fees of at least 4 million in 2009 varied from a 

 3  

  low of 22 basis points for the us treasury money fund to a high of 106 basis points for the emerging markets stock international discovery and latin america funds details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios 

certain of the t rowe price mutual funds also offer advisor and r classes of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the t rowe price mutual funds and enters into agreements with each intermediary payment of 12b1 fees is made by each fund directly to the applicable intermediaries 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding administrative revenue in our consolidated statement of income we also recognize as part of our other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income the corresponding payment of these fees from each fund to the thirdparty financial intermediaries the revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third party intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

several of the price funds including the index and summit funds instead have individual advisory fees or single allinclusive fees that cover both investment management and operating expenses each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest mutual funds for institutional investors each have separate advisory fee arrangements 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of the selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in the print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including enhancements to our website 

administrative services we provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds through our subsidiaries t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities and technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the price funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the funds 

our trustee services are provided by another subsidiary t rowe price trust company through this marylandchartered limitedservice trust company we offer common trust funds for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for retirement plans and iras t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans another subsidiary t rowe price savings bank issues federally insured certificates of deposit 

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals 

fund assets at december 31 2009 assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 2327 billion an increase of 415 or 683 billion from the beginning of the year the following table presents the net assets in billions of our largest funds net assets in excess of 5 billion at december 31 and the year each fund was started the spectrum and retirement series of funds are not presented in the table because their assets are already included in the underlying funds

  our operating subsidiaries invest in many of the t rowe price funds 

other investment portfolios we managed 1586 billion at december 31 2009 in other client investment portfolios up 467 billion from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios such as common trust funds luxembourgbased mutual funds and variable annuity life insurance plans at december 31 these portfolios included the following investment assets 

 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management in 2009 49 of these advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations the balance of our managed investment portfolios are generally billed quarterly with end of billing period values and monthend average values during the billing period accounting for 26 and 21 respectively of our 2009 revenues 

we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded 

our largest client account relationship outside the t rowe price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for about 3 of our investment advisory revenues in 2009

all aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal state and foreign laws and regulations these laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and the price funds’ shareholders they generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to comply with laws and regulations possible sanctions that may be imposed on us in the event that we fail to comply include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain business activities for specified periods of time revocation of our investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements including those of various federal state and foreign regulatory agencies our subsidiaries’ net capital as defined meets or exceeds all minimum requirements 

competition as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks and other financial institutions in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from timetotime in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

• investor mobility our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time on very short notice and without any significant penalty 

• general market declines a downturn in stock or bond prices such as that experienced during the last half of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management 

• investment performance if the investment performance of our managed portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable thirdparty benchmarks we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management institutional investors in particular consider changing investment advisers based upon poor relative investment performance individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance 

• global economies national and international political and economic events may cause financial market declines that lower the value of assets under our management and may cause investors to withdraw funds 

• investing trends changes in investing trends and in particular retirement savings trends including the prevalence of defined contribution retirement plans may reduce interest in our funds and portfolios and may alter our mix of assets under management 

• interest rate changes investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates 

• tax regulation changes changes in the status of tax deferred retirement plan investments and taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates and regulations could adversely affect investor behavior and may cause investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60day notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

 7  

  we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

• asset management firms • mutual fund companies • commercial banks and thrift institutions • insurance companies • hedge funds • exchange traded funds • brokerage and investment banking firms and • other financial institutions including multinational firms and subsidiaries of diversified conglomerates

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them we believe that competition within the investment management industry will intensify as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income if we are required to lower our fees in order to remain competitive our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed especially over shorter periods of time and others may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts management and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

certain of the price funds and other investment portfolios are vulnerable to marketspecific risks that could adversely affect investment performance our reputation and our revenues 

several of the price funds and investment portfolios for example emerging market investments are subject to political and economic instability wide exchangerate fluctuations illiquid and highly volatile markets and other risks that could materially decrease the investment returns available in foreign markets a significant decrease in the investment return or net asset value of any price fund or investment portfolio could harm our reputation and cause a decrease in assets under management including client asset withdrawals the result could be a material decline in our revenues and net income 

the performance of our money market funds is dependent on the income from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund when interest rates are at the historic lows that presently exist the operating costs of the funds will become a greater portion of the portfolio’s income and reduce the yield of the funds to very low levels in 2009 and presently such an environment has caused us to reduce our advisory fees on money market funds in order to maintain yields at or above 0 to fund investors such actions reduce our advisory fee income and net income also bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and money market funds have and could continue to experience redemptions client losses decrease our revenues and net income 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse affect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties and litigation 

operating risks include 

• failure to properly perform fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities including portfolio accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations 

• failure to properly perform transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities including transaction processing supervision of staff tax reporting and record retention and failure to identify excessive trading in mutual funds by our customers or plan participants 

 8  

  • sales and marketing risks including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of products and services in advertising materials public relations information or other external communications and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

• changes in the level of our advertising expenses including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the united states and further penetrating us distribution channels 

• variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants and other stockbased awards changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes changes in our employee count and mix competitive factors and inflation 

• a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our balance sheet 

• unanticipated material fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad 

• expenses and capital costs incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development 

• unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill and 

• disruptions of thirdparty services such as communications power and mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

under our agreements with the t rowe price mutual funds we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

more than 30 of our assets under management are sourced from our largest distribution channel thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and abroad these intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on third party financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third party intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

• decreasing investment valuations in and returns on the investment portfolios that we manage 

• causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive 

• incapacitating or inflicting losses of lives among our associates 

• interrupting our business operations 

• triggering technology delays or failures and 

• requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage replace our facilities and restore our operations 

 9  

  we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose any associates or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to continue our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in our stock blended asset and bond mutual funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments like those recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income are expected to occur in the future 

the investment performance of our savings bank subsidiary could adversely affect our assets and results of operations 

we have a savings bank subsidiary that accepts time deposits from customers pays a fixed rate of interest to them and invests in assetbacked debt securities although we generally hold these investments to maturity which generally correlates to the maturities of our customer deposits fluctuations in credit risk could result in impairments among the bank’s fixed income investments and in turn could result in a mismatch between a lower or negative return on our investment portfolio and the interest paid on our customer deposits to the extent that this occurs our assets and results of operations would be adversely affected 

we may elect to pursue growth in the united states and abroad through acquisitions or joint ventures which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations expanding into new jurisdictions and making noncontrolling minority investments in other entities 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities we cannot assure that we will identify and consummate any such transactions on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy in addition any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

in january 2010 we completed the acquisition of a 26 investment in uti asset management company india and we may consider noncontrolling minority investments in other entities in the future we may not realize future returns from such investments or any collaborative activities that may develop 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

we are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in great britain and selfregulatory organizations such as finra the conduct of our business is in large part dictated by adherence to such regulation including federal laws such as the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the usa patriot act of 2001 the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa regulations relating to the mutual fund industry specifically and securities laws generally accounting standards and banking and tax laws compliance with these complex regulations and our disclosure and financial reporting obligations requires significant investments of time and money and could limit our ability to enter into new lines of business further the regulations imposed by one jurisdiction may conflict with the regulations imposed by another and these differences may be difficult or impossible to reconcile 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden cause a loss of mutual fund investors and reduce our revenues 

because of the recent disclosures of trading abuses and fraudulent investment activities the collapse of the independent investment banking industry in the us and massive government investment in the us banking and financial system regulators have shown increasing interest in the oversight of the broad financial and investment industry federal agencies have adopted some and proposed other new regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence more oversight and rules can be expected in the future that could place greater compliance and administrative burdens on us which likely would increase our expenses without increasing revenues in addition new regulations could require the price funds to reduce the level of certain mutual fund fees paid to us or require us to bear additional expenses 

 10  

  which would affect our operating results further adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund investment advisory and financial services firms could tarnish the reputation of the financial services industry generally and mutual funds and investment advisers more specifically causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their account balances redemptions would decrease the assets under our management which would reduce our advisory revenues and net income 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot assure that our insurance will cover most liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum requirements however a significant operating or investment loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

• securities analysis • securities trading • portfolio management • customer service • accounting and internal financial processes and controls and • regulatory compliance and reporting 

all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism and other causes some of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure a suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology if we are unable to upgrade our technology in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations we maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance that fraudulent activity including misappropriation of assets fraudulent financial reporting and unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data is either prevented or timely detected our systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things 

• seriously damage our reputation • allow competitors access to our proprietary business information • subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data • result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers 

 11  

  • subject us to regulatory action and • require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios investment advisory clients outside the united states account for nearly 12 of our assets under management at december 31 2009 

we manage a broad range of us international and global stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations 

we remain debtfree with substantial liquidity and financial resources that afford us flexibility during periods of market turmoil and the stability to prudently manage the firm for the longterm our financial strength allows us to remain focused on our clients during periods of market stress and to take advantage of growth opportunities throughout market cycles as a result recent financial market turmoil has not led us to fundamentally change our business model or significantly modify our operations as has been the case with many other financial services companies 

background 

the severe downturn in global financial markets especially during the second half of 2008 and early 2009 added significant additional volatility to investor returns and our financial results including significant changes in our assets under management and related advisory revenues the value of our corporate mutual fund investments our operating cash flows and our net income 

while we are always vigilant in controlling our operating expenses we began a series of cost reduction and avoidance initiatives in late 2007 to get ahead of deteriorating market conditions these efforts were heightened through the last two years especially with the equity market’s steep decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009 and included a 55 reduction of our workforce in april 2009 in addition to other cost reductions we realized a net savings in 2009 from the workforce reduction of 52 million as the related second quarter charge was more than offset by expense savings over the balance of the year net of related administrative fee reductions that benefitted shareholders of the t rowe price mutual funds through attrition retirements and the workforce reduction our number of associates at the end of 2009 is 4802 down 108 from the 5385 employed at the beginning of the year 

 14  

  in the first quarter of 2009 major largecap indexes plunged to 12year lows as the economy contracted and unemployment surged governments around the world intervened aggressively to provide liquidity to the credit markets stabilize the banking sector and stimulate economic activity from late march through the end of the year investor sentiment improved and share prices rose as credit market conditions loosened corporate earnings improved in many sectors and the us economy showed signs of emerging from recession as we enter 2010 the question has become how strong global economic growth will be and whether it can be sustained 

in this environment the sp 500 index of largecap companies in leading industries of the us economy returned 265 in 2009 while the nasdaq composite index which is heavily weighted with technology companies was up 439 excluding dividends returns on stocks in many nonus markets were stronger in 2009 as global economies were improving and weakness in the us dollar enhanced dollardenominated returns emerging markets produced stellar returns with brazil russia india and china among the topperforming equity markets developed asian and european equity markets in comparison were less robust with japan trailing significantly the msci emerging markets index returned 790 versus 325 for the msci eafe index which measures the performance of mostly largecap equities in europe australasia and the far east 

the us federal reserve’s target funds rate remained the lowest in history — in the range of 0 to 25 — throughout 2009 and the abundant liquidity at government auctions put downward pressure on the short side of the us treasury yield curve the annual yield on onemonth treasury bills was only 04 at the end of 2009 and money market fund returns had plunged to near 0 on the longer side the yield on the benchmark 10year us treasuries ended the year at 385 up 160 basis points from the end of 2008 

credit spreads to riskier debt securities narrowed considerably over the year moving back to levels that are more normal investors that had moved into highquality government issues are now moving to higher yielding junk bonds and emerging market debt as a result the credit suisse high yield index gained 542 in 2009 and the jpmorgan emerging markets bond index global in us dollar terms returned 282 the barclays capital municipal bond index gained 129 and the barclays capital us aggregate index gained 59 adding to strong returns among debt securities 

in this business environment investors entrusted net inflows of 227 billion to our management in 2009 including 147 billion that originated during the second half of the year total assets under our management ended 2009 at 3913 billion a substantial recovery from 2763 billion at the end of 2008 to a level approaching the historical periodend high of 4000 billion at december 31 2007 our assets under management in billions have changed during the past three years as follows 

 

over the last three years our net cash inflows have been sourced most significantly from thirdparty financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows across each of our four distribution channels 

assets under management at december 31 2009 include 2904 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 1009 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the investment portfolios that we manage consist of 2327 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1586 billion in other investment portfolios including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts may often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management 

results of operations 

2009 versus 2008  investment advisory revenues were down 12 or 215 million to more than 15 billion in 2009 as average assets under our management of 3213 billion in 2009 were 369 billion lower than in 2008 the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 481 basis points during 2009 down from the 492 basis points earned during 2008 lower equity market valuations resulted in an increase in the percentage of our assets under management being attributable to lower fee fixed income portfolios including money market funds for which we reduced advisory fees in order to maintain yields at or above 0 to fund investors 

net revenues decreased 12 or 249 million to nearly 19 billion operating expenses fell 8 or 102 million to almost 12 billion in 2009 overall net operating income in 2009 decreased 147 million or 17 to 702 million our operating margin declined to 376 in 2009 from 401 in 2008 as the impact of lower average market valuations over 2009 which decreased our assets under management and 

 15  

  corresponding advisory revenues was offset only partially by the savings from our cost reduction efforts our nonoperating investment loss decreased nearly 40 million due to the higher other than temporary impairment charges recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds net income fell 12 or 57 million to nearly 434 million diluted earnings per share on our common stock also decreased to 165 down 9 or 16 from 181 in 2008 the retrospective application in 2009 of new financial reporting guidance that recognizes our outstanding restricted stock and stock units on which we pay nonforfeitable dividends as if they were a separate class of stock reduced previously reported 2008 diluted earnings per share on our common stock of 182 by 01 per share the nonoperating charges to recognize other than temporary impairments of our fund investments reduced diluted earnings per share by 21 in 2008 and 09 in 2009 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states decreased more than 170 million or 14 from 2008 to almost 11 billion average mutual fund assets were 1918 billion in 2009 down 11 from the average of 2161 billion during 2008 net inflows to the mutual funds in 2009 were 125 billion including 64 billion that originated from our targetdate retirement funds our bond funds added 100 billion of net inflows including 63 billion from four funds — new income short term bond international bond and emerging markets bond – that each added more than 1 billion during the year the stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of 48 billion after the transfer of 13 billion to other investment portfolios under our management the equity index 500 and midcap growth funds had total net inflows of 25 billion in 2009 our money market funds had net outflows of 23 billion during the year higher market valuations and income increased mutual fund assets under management by 558 billion in 2009 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage decreased 44 million or 85 to 4778 million in 2009 average assets in these portfolios were 1295 billion during 2009 down 126 billion or 9 from 2008 other investment portfolio assets under management increased 467 billion during 2009 including 365 billion in market gains and income and 102 billion of net inflows primarily from institutional investors net inflows include 13 billion transferred from the stock and blended asset mutual funds during 2009 

administrative fees decreased 35 million or 10 to 319 million in 2009 this change includes a 4 million decrease in 12b1 distribution and service fees recognized on lower average assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual funds and a 31 million reduction in our mutual fund servicing revenue which is primarily attributable to our cost reduction efforts in the mutual fund and retirement plan servicing functions changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

our largest expense compensation and related costs decreased 42 million or 5 from 2008 to 773 million in 2009 the largest part of this decrease is attributable to a 19 million reduction in our annual bonus program reductions in the use of outside contractors lowered 2009 costs 14 million with the remainder of the cost savings primarily attributable to the workforce reduction and lower employee benefits and other employment expenses average headcount in 2009 was down 54 from 2008 due to attrition retirements and our workforce reduction 

advertising and promotion expenditures were down 31 million or 30 versus 2008 due to our decision to reduce spending in response to lower investor activity in the 2009 market environment we currently estimate that our advertising and promotion expenditures for 2010 could increase up to 30 from 2009 and that first quarter 2010 spending will be about 26 million we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 

depreciation expense and other occupancy and facility costs together increased only 4 million or 25 compared to 2008 as we moderated or delayed our capital spending and facility growth plans 

other operating expenses decreased 33 million or 18 from 2008 including a decline of 4 million in distribution and service expenses recognized on lower average assets under management in our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares that are sourced from financial intermediaries our cost control efforts resulted in the remaining expense reductions including lower professional fees and travel and related costs 

our nonoperating investment activity resulted in net losses of 127 million in 2009 and 523 million in 2008 the improvement of nearly 40 million is primarily attributable to a reduction in the other than temporary impairments recognized on our investments in sponsored mutual funds in 2009 versus 2008 the following table details our related mutual fund investment gains and losses in millions during the past two years 

 

lower income of 16 million from our money market holdings due to the significantly lower interest rate environment offset the improvement experienced with our fund investments there is no impairment of any of our mutual fund investments at december 31 2009 

the 2009 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 371 down from 384 in 2008 and 9 lower than our present estimate of 380 for the 2010 effective tax rate our 2009 provision includes reductions of prior years’ tax provisions and discrete nonrecurring benefits that lowered our 2009 effective tax rate by 10 

2008 versus 2007  investment advisory revenues decreased 63 or 118 million to 176 billion in 2008 as average assets under our management decreased 16 billion to 3582 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 492 basis 

 16  

  points in 2008 down from the 502 basis points earned in 2007 as lower equity market valuations resulted in a greater percentage of our assets under management being attributable to lower fee fixed income portfolios continuing stress on the financial markets and resulting lower equity valuations as 2008 progressed resulted in lower average assets under our management lower investment advisory fees and lower net income as compared to prior periods 

net revenues decreased 5 or 112 million to 212 billion operating expenses were 127 billion in 2008 up 29 or 36 million from 2007 net operating income for 2008 decreased 1479 million or 148 to 8485 million higher operating expenses in 2008 and decreased market valuations during the latter half of 2008 which lowered our assets under management and advisory revenues resulted in our 2008 operating margin declining to 401 from 447 in 2007 nonoperating investment losses in 2008 were 523 million as compared to investment income of 804 million in 2007 investment losses in 2008 include noncash charges of 913 million for the other than temporary impairment of certain of the firm’s investments in sponsored mutual funds net income in 2008 fell 27 or nearly 180 million from 2007 diluted earnings per share after the retrospective application of new accounting guidance effective in 2009 decreased to 181 down 59 or 246 from 240 in 2007 a nonoperating charge to recognize other than temporary impairments of our sponsored mutual fund investments reduced diluted earnings per share by 21 in 2008 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states decreased 85 or 1145 million to 124 billion average mutual fund assets were 2161 billion in 2008 down 167 billion from 2007 mutual fund assets at december 31 2008 were 1644 billion down 816 billion from the end of 2007 

net inflows to the mutual funds during 2008 were 39 billion including 19 billion to the money funds 11 billion to the bond funds and 9 billion to the stock funds the value equity index 500 and emerging markets stock funds combined to add 41 billion while the midcap growth and equity income stock funds had net redemptions of 22 billion net fund inflows of 62 billion originated in our targetdate retirement funds which in turn invest in other t rowe price funds fund net inflow amounts in 2008 are presented net of 13 billion that was transferred to targetdate trusts from the retirement funds during the year decreases in market valuations and income not reinvested lowered our mutual fund assets under management by 855 billion during 2008 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage decreased 36 million to 5222 million average assets in these portfolios were 1421 billion during 2008 up slightly from 1414 billion in 2007 these minor changes each less than 1 are attributable to the timing of declining equity market valuations and cash flows among our separate account and subadvised portfolios net inflows primarily from institutional investors were 132 billion during 2008 including the 13 billion transferred from the retirement funds to targetdate trusts decreases in market valuations net of income lowered our assets under management in these portfolios by 553 billion during 2008 

administrative fees which increased 58 million to 3539 million are generally offset by related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 184 million or 23 from 2007 this increase includes 372 million in salaries resulting from an 84 increase in our average staff count and an increase of our associates’ base salaries at the beginning of the year at december 31 2008 we employed 5385 associates up 60 from the end of 2007 primarily to add capabilities and support increased volumerelated activities and other growth over the past few years over the course of 2008 we slowed the growth of our associate base from earlier plans and the prior year we also reduced our annual bonuses 276 million versus the 2007 year in response to unfavorable financial market conditions that negatively impacted our operating results the balance of the increase is attributable to higher employee benefits and employmentrelated expenses including an increase of 57 million in stockbased compensation 

after higher spending during the first quarter of 2008 versus 2007 investor sentiment in the uncertain and volatile market environment caused us to reduce advertising and promotion spending which for the year was down 38 million from 2007 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 18 million or 12 compared to 2007 we expanded and renovated our facilities in 2008 to accommodate the growth in our associates to meet business demands 

other operating expenses were up 33 million from 2007 we increased our spending 98 million primarily for professional fees and information and other thirdparty services reductions in travel and charitable contributions partially offset these increases 

our nonoperating investment activity resulted in a net loss of 523 million in 2008 as compared to a net gain of 804 million in 2007 this change of 1327 million is primarily attributable to losses recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds which resulted from declines in financial market values during the year 

 

we recognized other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds because of declines in fair value below cost for an extended period the significant declines in fair value below cost that occurred in 2008 were generally attributable to adverse market conditions 

 17  

  in addition income from money market and bond fund holdings was 193 million lower than in 2007 due to the significantly lower interest rate environment of 2008 lower interest rates also led to substantial capital appreciation on our 40 million holding of us treasury notes that we sold in december 2008 at a 26 million gain 

the 2008 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 384 up from 377 in 2007 primarily to reflect changes in state income tax rates and regulations and certain adjustments made prospectively based on our annual income tax return filings for 2007 

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2009 stockholders’ equity increased from 25 billion to 29 billion we repurchased nearly 23 million common shares for 67 million in 2009 tangible book value is 22 billion at december 31 2009 and our cash and cash equivalents and our mutual fund investment holdings total 14 billion given the availability of these financial resources we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity 

on january 20 2010 we purchased a 26 equity interest in uti asset management company and an affiliate for 1424 million we funded the acquisition from our cash holdings in addition to the pending uti acquisition we had outstanding commitments to fund other investments totaling 354 million at december 31 2009 we presently anticipate funding 2010 property and equipment expenditures of about 150 million from our cash balances and operating cash inflows 

2009 versus 2008  operating activities during 2009 provided cash flows of nearly 536 million down 206 million from 2008 including a 57 million decrease in net income and a 129 million change in the timing differences in the cash settlement of our accounts receivable and accrued revenues and payables and accrued liabilities in addition our addback of the noncash charges for other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds was 55 million more in 2008 than in 2009 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 167 million in 2009 up 42 million from 2008 we made net investments of nearly 18 million into our mutual fund portfolio in 2009 an increase of 15 million from 2008 during the past two years we made several changes totaling more than 56 million in 2009 and 95 million in 2008 to the composition of our portfolio of mutual fund holdings in light of market conditions experienced during the period because of the smaller 2009 increase in savings bank deposits we increased our investment in debt securities held by the savings bank by only 9 million in 2009 versus 41 million in 2008 as noted below in our discussion of investing activities during 2008 versus 2007 our 70 million us treasury notes portfolio was liquidated in 2008 thereby producing inflows of nearly 73 million that did not recur in 2009 

net cash used in financing activities was 245 million in 2009 down 538 million from 2008 compared to 2008 we expended 543 million less to repurchase our common shares in 2009 the uncertain market environment led us to reduce our share repurchases and preserve our liquid capital during this past year our 01 per share quarterly dividend increase in 2009 accounts for an additional payout of 10 million in dividends however our 2008 change in policy regarding the timing of dividend payments such that our quarterly dividends are declared and paid in the same quarter resulted in five quarterly dividend payments in 2008 versus only four in 2009 this additional payment resulted in our 2009 outflows for dividends decreasing 64 million from 2008 excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation plans decreased 37 million as fewer stock option exercises due to uncertainties and lower market valuations of our common stock reduced our common stock issuances about 25 from 2008 

2008 versus 2007  operating activities during 2008 provided cash flows of nearly 742 million down 16 million from 2007 reconciling items include lower net income of almost 180 million that was offset by timing differences of about 59 million in the cash settlement of our operating receivables and payables other than temporary impairments of our sponsored mutual fund investments totaling 91 million greater depreciation expense on our increased property and equipment of 8 million and nearly 6 million of additional stockbased compensation account for the remainder of the difference between 2007 and 2008 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 125 million in 2008 down 220 million from 2007 in 2007 we invested a net of 1755 million in our sponsored mutual funds from our available cash resources on a net basis we added only 26 million to our fund holdings in 2008 however we made 95 million of changes to the composition of our portfolio of mutual fund holdings in light of market conditions during the year because of an increase in savings bank deposits we also increased our investment in debt securities held by the savings bank by 41 million in 2008 while we made other investments of 23 million in 2007 we made only 10 million of other investments in 2008 we also received proceeds of 426 million on the sales and 30 million on the maturities of our 70 million us treasury notes portfolio 

net cash used in financing activities was 783 million in 2008 up 382 million from 2007 our strong cash position allowed us to increase our common stock repurchases by 302 million in 2008 versus 2007 our cash outflows for dividends paid increased 132 million during the first quarter of 2008 we changed our policy regarding the timing of dividend payments such that our quarterly dividends are now declared and paid in the same quarter accordingly our cash outflows for 2008 include the payout of dividends for the fourth quarter 2007 and all four quarters of 2008 additionally we increased the quarterly dividend payment from 17 per share made in each of the four 2007 quarters to 24 per share beginning with the payment made in january 2008 lastly deposits at our savings bank subsidiary increased nearly 44 million in 2008 as depositors sought the security of fdicbacked accounts

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2009 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2010 and future years the information also excludes the 7 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 

 

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional investments including the acquisition of 26 of uti totaling 178 million at december 31 2009 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2009 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

other than temporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as availableforsale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

a mutual fund holding with an impairment that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an otherthantemporary loss that we will recognize in our statement of income if the impairment is caused by a change in credit quality that affects our ability to recover our amortized cost or if we intend to sell the security or believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovering cost minor impairments of 5 or less are generally considered temporary 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit – our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business our market capitalization exceeds our carrying amount our stockholders’ equity and therefore that no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet 6657 million 

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading and are of longer duration the blackscholes option pricing model that we use includes 

 19  

  the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determination of our annual provision is subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result we recognize additions to or reductions of income tax expense during a reporting period that pertain to prior period provisions as our estimated liabilities are revised and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior period adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

newly issued but not yet adopted accounting guidance 

each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted accounting and reporting guidance that is applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements we do not believe that any issued guidance that we have not yet adopted will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to our revenues net income and earnings per share on common stock changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels and possible expense savings our estimated effective income tax rate and our expectations regarding financial markets future transactions investments capital expenditures and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k annual report further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income loss will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments and changes in their market valuations 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors our success in implementing and realizing any future cost reduction and avoidance efforts any goodwill impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management accordingly declines in financial market values like those experienced during the last two years directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues as well as our investment income and net income 

we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive financial instruments primarily for purposes other than trading mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

in conjunction with our signing of the definitive uti purchase agreements in november 2009 we entered into a series of rolling nondeliverable forward contracts to economically hedge the exchange rate exposure relating to the 65 billion indian rupee acquisition price final settlement of these contracts occurred at the closing of the uti acquisition on january 20 2010 we have not invested in any other derivative financial or commodity instruments 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund’s lowest net asset value per share during 2009 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all funds experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

 

the comparable potential loss of value presented in our 2008 annual report was 615 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 5135 million that included a net unrealized loss of 175 million at december 31 2008 during 2009 we experienced net gains of 1508 million including the recognition of 361 million of other than temporary impairments in our nonoperating investment loss 

because our fund holdings are considered availableforsale securities we recognize unrealized losses that are considered temporary in other comprehensive income we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating investment income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary a mutual fund holding with an impairment that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption the amount and timing of any future charge will be dependent on our holdings and future market performance 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 

we also hold other investments of 457 million at december 31 2009 that we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount should market conditions deteriorate 

we operate in several foreign countries most prominent among which is great britain we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in us dollars we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

 item 1 business 

t rowe price group is a financial services holding company that derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

we operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies primarily t rowe price associates t rowe price international and t rowe price global investment services the late thomas rowe price jr began our advisory business in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000 

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base across four primary distribution channels thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and other countries individual us investors on a direct basis us defined contribution retirement plans and institutional investors in the us and other countries 

we manage a broad range of us and international stock blended asset bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors mutual fund shareholders can exchange balances among mutual funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change 

from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund if we believe that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund in order to maintain the integrity of the fund’s investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders at present the following funds are closed to all new investors 

 

these funds continue to attract cash inflows from existing fund shareholders and direct rollovers from retirement plans into new ira accounts that we offer 

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus investment management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global or international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity and asset allocation investment strategies including target retirementdate investment portfolios as well as active systematic and municipal taxfree management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities received from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the united states and great britain with additional staff resident in argentina hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling 

  we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds discount brokerage and trust services more than 90 of our administrative revenues in 2008 were determined based on the recovery of expenses incurred to provide the related services changes in our administrative revenues and related expenses therefore do not significantly affect our operating or net income 

information concerning our revenues results of operations total assets and investment assets under our management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial statements and in note 2 thereto which are both included in item 8 of this form 10k 

2008 developments 

total assets under our management decreased 1237 billion over the course of 2008 and ended the year at 2763 billion including nearly 188 billion held in retirement accounts and variable annuity investment portfolios our yearend assets under management include 1969 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 794 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the investment portfolios that we manage consist of 1644 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1119 billion in other investment portfolios including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us nonus dollar denominated securities account for about 37 billion of our yearend assets under management 

five price funds — growth stock equity income midcap growth blue chip growth and capital appreciation — at december 31 2008 accounted for nearly 25 of investment advisory revenues in 2008 and 19 of assets under management at december 31 2008 

our international clients account for nearly 10 of our total assets under management at december 31 2008 up from 9 at the beginning of the year 

the firm’s longterm investment advisory results relative to our peers remain good with 78 of the t rowe price funds across their share classes surpassing their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2008 at least 67 outperforming the average for the three and 10year periods and 54 outperforming for the oneyear period in addition t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds that ended the quarter with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar account for more than 58 of our rated funds’ assets under management 

in the unsettled financial market environment of 2008 investors entrusted net inflows of 171 billion to our management in 2008 during the first half of the year net inflows were 178 billion the steep financial market downturn and extreme market volatility caused investors to be more cautious in the second half of 2008 and we experienced net outflows of 7 billion see the background section of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this report for more information on the market environment in which we operated during 2008 

price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

advisory services investment advisory revenues are determined daily based on the net assets managed in each fund additional revenues are earned for advisoryrelated administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid monthly by each of the price funds is generally computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee rate for the majority of the price funds the fee is equal to the sum of an individual fund charge that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective and a group charge that is set based on the aggregate net assets of those funds the individual fund charge for each of our four largest funds — growth stock equity income midcap growth and blue chip growth — is a weighted average determined by applying a 15 reduction for net assets in excess of 15 billion to the base individual fund rate the group charge is derived from a tiered fee schedule the effective group charge when combined net assets exceed 160 billion is calculated based on a weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers of 31025 basis points for the first 160 billion of net assets plus 29 basis points on the next 60 billion of net assets and 285 basis points on net assets in excess of 220 billion to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of a fund’s advisory fee rate and therefore the advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease 

our 2008 fee rates determined in the above manner for funds available to individual investors that are not subject to expense limitations vary from a low of 31 basis points for the us treasury funds to a high of 106 basis points for the emerging europe  mediterranean emerging markets stock international discovery and latin america funds details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

  each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios 

certain of the t rowe price mutual funds also offer advisor and r classes of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the t rowe price mutual funds and enters into agreements with each intermediary payment of 12b1 fees is made by each fund directly to the applicable intermediaries 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding administrative revenue in our consolidated statement of income we also recognize as part of our other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income the corresponding payment of these fees from each fund to the thirdparty financial intermediaries the revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third party intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

several of the price funds have different fee arrangements the equity market index funds and the summit funds each have single allinclusive fees covering all investment management and operating expenses each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest mutual funds for institutional investors each have separate advisory fee arrangements 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of the selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in the print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including enhancements to our web site 

administrative services we provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds through our subsidiaries t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities and technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the price funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the funds 

our trustee services are provided by another subsidiary t rowe price trust company through this marylandchartered limitedservice trust company we offer common trust funds for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for retirement plans and iras t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans another subsidiary t rowe price savings bank issues federally insured certificates of deposit 

we also provide nondiscretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals 

fund assets at december 31 2008 assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 1644 billion a decrease of 33 or 816 billion from the beginning of the year the following table presents the net assets in billions of our largest funds net assets in excess of 5 billion at december 31 and the year each fund was started the spectrum and retirement series of funds are not presented in the table because their assets are already included in the underlying funds 

   

  we invest in many of the t rowe price funds through our operating subsidiaries and our investments holding company subsidiary trp finance 

other investment portfolios we managed 1119 billion at december 31 2008 in other client investment portfolios down 421 billion from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios such as common trust funds luxembourgbased mutual funds and variable annuity life insurance plans at december 31 these portfolios included the following investment assets 

 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management in 2008 over 50 of these advisory fees were recognized based on daily valuations the balance of these managed investment portfolios are generally billed quarterly with end of billing period values accounting for 30 of our 2008 revenues average monthend valuations account for about 15 of revenues while beginning of period values were the basis for less than 5 of our fees 

we charge fees for investment management to these clients based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from timetotime in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with stable value portfolios and money market securities at the lower end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

   

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60day notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them we believe that competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income if we are required to lower our fees in order to remain competitive our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed especially over shorter periods of time and others may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts management and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry strong financial services professionals are in demand and we face significant competition for highly qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

certain of the price funds and other investment portfolios are vulnerable to marketspecific risks that could adversely affect investment performance our reputation and our revenues 

several of the price funds and investment portfolios for example emerging market investments are subject to political and economic instability wide exchangerate fluctuations illiquid and highly volatile markets and other risks that could materially decrease the investment returns available in foreign markets a significant decrease in the investment return or net asset value of any price fund or investment portfolio could harm our reputation and cause a decrease in assets under management including client asset withdrawals the result could be a material decline in our revenues and net income 

the performance of our money market funds is dependent on the income from the underlying securities exceeding the operating costs of the fund when interest rates are at the historic lows that presently exist the operating costs of the funds will absorb a greater portion of the portfolio’s income and reduce the yield of the funds to very low levels in this environment bank deposits may become more attractive to investors and our money market funds could suffer redemptions client losses would decrease our revenues and net income 

  our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse affect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties and litigation 

operating risks include 

 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

 

under our agreements with the t rowe price mutual funds we charge the mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

more than 30 of our assets under management are sourced from our largest distribution channel thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and abroad these intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on third party financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third party intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

  natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

 

we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose any employees or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to continue our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in our stock blended asset and bond mutual funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our nonoperating investment income could be adversely affected by the realization of losses upon the disposition of our investments or the recognition of significant otherthantemporary impairments like those recognized in the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and interest rates and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income can be expected to occur in the future 

the investment performance of our savings bank subsidiary could adversely affect our assets and results of operations 

we have a savings bank subsidiary that accepts time deposits from customers pays a fixed rate of interest to them and invests in assetbacked debt securities although we generally hold these investments to maturity which generally correlates to the maturities of our customer deposits fluctuations in credit risk could result in otherthantemporary impairments among the fixed income investments and in turn could result in a mismatch between the return on our investment portfolio and the interest paid on our customer deposits to the extent that this occurs our assets and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may elect to pursue growth in the united states and abroad through acquisitions or joint ventures which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations and in expanding into new jurisdictions 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities we cannot assure that we will identify and consummate any such transactions on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy in addition any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

we are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in great britain and selfregulatory organizations such as finra the conduct of our business is in large part dictated by adherence to such regulation including federal laws such as the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the usa patriot act of 2001 the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa regulations relating to the mutual fund industry specifically and securities laws generally accounting standards and banking and tax laws compliance with these complex regulations and our disclosure and financial reporting obligations requires significant investments of time and money and could limit our ability to enter into new lines of business further the regulations imposed by one jurisdiction may conflict with the regulations imposed by another and these differences may be difficult or impossible to reconcile 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations 

  if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden cause a loss of mutual fund investors and reduce our revenues 

because of the recent exposure of trading abuses and fraudulent investment activities the collapse of the independent investment banking industry in the us and massive government investment in the us banking and financial system regulators have shown increasing interest in the oversight of the broad financial and investment industry federal agencies have adopted regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence and more oversight and rules can be expected in the future that could place greater compliance and administrative burdens on us which likely would increase our expenses without increasing revenues in addition new regulations could require the price funds to reduce the level of certain mutual fund fees paid to us or require us to bear additional expenses which would affect our operating results further adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund investment advisory and financial services firms could tarnish the reputation of the financial services industry generally and mutual funds and investment advisers more specifically causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their balances redemptions would decrease the assets under our management which would reduce our advisory revenues and net income 

we may become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot assure that our insurance will cover most liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available at acceptable terms and fees certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum requirements however a significant operating or investment loss or an extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among others 

 

all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism and other causes some of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure a suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology if we are unable to upgrade our technology in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

  we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations our systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios investment advisory clients outside the united states account for nearly 10 of our assets under management at december 31 2008 

we manage a broad range of us and international stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management affect our revenues and results of operations 

neither our clients nor we could escape the severe downturn in global financial markets during 2008 although we have not experienced a fundamental change in our business model like many other financial services companies the collateral damage from the global economic woes significantly reduced our assets under management related advisory revenues and the value of our corporate mutual fund investments in 2008 in response we have been vigilant about our expense levels and started a series of expensereduction initiatives accelerating those efforts as the market dramatically declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 ultimately our actual 2008 expenses were well below the levels originally planned as we continue to rein in expenses we presently expect that our 2009 operating expenses will fall below those of 2007 

we remain debtfree with substantial liquidity and resources that are available to help us ride through the current market crises while prudently managing the firm for the longterm our financial stability allows us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities invest in key capabilities including investment professionals and technologies and most importantly provide our clients with strong investment management expertise and service while we believe 2009 will be a tough year for consumers and investors alike around the world we think the investment environment will improve as we move into the latter half of the year and efforts to get the global economy back on track gain traction 

background 

the aftermath of the subprime mortgage market implosion in 2007 and the continuing credit crisis have significantly affected financial markets at the beginning of 2008 equities declined dramatically around the world in the united states economic growth in the first quarter was low and the downside risks in the economic outlook increased the federal reserve responded with a substantial further easing of us monetary policy that reduced the federal funds rate by 225 basis points to 2 by the end of april the federal government also acted with a fiscal stimulus package for american households and the federal reserve initiated a series of actions intended to increase liquidity among not only the large commercial banks but also large nonbank securities dealers 

early july saw further financial market declines as many major indexes fell 20 below their most recent highs in october 2007 as summer progressed the continuing severe downturn in the housing sector and the restraining effect of writedowns on bank capital and in turn credit availability further pressured the markets in early september the us government acted to take control of the governmentsponsored mortgage enterprises fannie mae and freddie mac and took numerous other largely unprecedented actions to seek to stabilize the financial services industry the investment banking industry in the us was transformed almost overnight as a merger a bankruptcy and two conversions to bank holding companies either eliminated or reorganized the four largest independent firms subsequently a large unrelated institutional money market mutual fund “broke the buck” and went into liquidation also mortgage and other asset quality concerns continued to weaken both larger and smaller commercial banks some of which experienced fdic takeovers further government assistance and additional mergers 

in the midst of this turmoil in the us markets global equity markets declined dramatically and banking and credit market conditions deteriorated throughout the world in september and october central banks and governments acted sometimes jointly to shore up financial institutions and markets by injecting liquidity and capital directly into the global banking system and easing monetary policy further in the us the federal reserve reduced the target federal funds rate to 1 by the end of october and congress enacted an extraordinary 700 billion support package that sought to stabilize the financial system most of the first half of this package authorized to be spent before year end went to large banks in exchange for preferred shares and warrants however the program also extended debt and equity financing to the automotive industry and a large insurance company at yearend credit markets were still tight and equity markets remained volatile with significant daily swings in valuations fears of recession and an uncertain timeframe for economic recovery weighed on investors given the uncertain outlook and lower demand energy prices had weakened with oil falling more than 100 below its record high in july 2008 in middecember the federal reserve reduced the target funds rate to a range of 0 to 25 the lowest in history in doing so it noted that “weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time” 

with the ongoing global recession now acknowledged expectations for the economy’s performance in 2009 are generally low markdowns in scheduled production and significant employee layoffs have been announced as businesses aggressively cut costs and households reduce spending financial markets remain strained and equity prices declined further in january in addition to the remaining 350 billion from the 700 billion fall package the new us administration has proposed a substantial further stimulus package that would include more than 800 billion of tax cuts and federal spending to turn the economy around we are hopeful that this package building on the monetary and fiscal actions already taken will eventually provide the necessary foundation for a restoration of confidence in financial markets and a resumption of economic growth 

  in the stressful and volatile financial markets of 2008 us stock indexes produced significant negative results the broad sp 500 index of largecap companies in leading industries of the us economy registered a 370 loss while the nasdaq composite index which is heavily weighted with technology companies was down 405 excluding dividends performance of stocks outside the united states was worse with a strengthening us dollar increasing the magnitude of losses in dollar terms the msci eafe index which measures the performance of mostly largecap stocks in europe australasia and the far east produced a 431 loss while the msci emerging markets index had an even larger loss of 532 for 2008 

us treasury yields declined sharply across the maturity spectrum over the course of 2008 with shorter maturities experiencing the greatest movement as investors sought the safest shortterm instruments and liquidity the yield on the benchmark 10year us treasuries was 225 at december 31 2008 down 179 basis points from the end of 2007 on the shortest side of the yield curve both the one and threemonth yields were only 11 at yearend 2008 down 265 and 325 basis points respectively from the beginning of the year 

the flight to credit quality amid the economic and financial turmoil of 2008 led other debt securities to record widely disparate returns with liquidity and credit quality driving the results the barclays capital us aggregate index a broad measure of the taxable domestic investmentgrade bond market returned 524 the barclays capital municipal bond index lost 247 as the municipal market suffered from forced selling from leveraged investors and concerns about the condition of state finances the credit suisse high yield index lost 2617 as investors anticipated a wave of defaults among highyield bonds and the assetbacked segment suffered from worries over consumer debt bonds from developed markets overseas enjoyed a small gain largely because of currency exchange movements over the year and the barclays capital global aggregate exus dollar bond index returned 439 

in this unsettled environment investors entrusted net inflows of 171 billion to our management in 2008 during the first half of the year net inflows were 178 billion the steep financial market downturn and extreme market volatility caused investors to be more cautious in the second half of 2008 and we experienced net outflows of 7 billion total assets under our management ended 2008 at 2763 billion down 309 from the end of 2007 and up only 25 over the last three years from december 31 2005 during this period our assets under management in billions have changed as follows 

 

over the last three years our net cash inflows have been sourced most significantly from thirdparty financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world our relative investment performance over much of this period and brand awareness contributed significantly to attracting net inflows across each of our four distribution channels 

assets under management at december 31 2008 include 1969 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 794 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the investment portfolios that we manage consist of 1644 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1119 billion in other investment portfolios including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 

our 5135 million portfolio of investments in sponsored mutual funds at december 31 2008 includes unrealized losses of 403 million that are considered temporary and accordingly are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive losses in stockholders’ equity this unrealized loss is comprised of 301 million attributable to investments valued at 1159 million that have been temporarily impaired on a continuous basis from september 30 2008 and 102 million arising in the fourth quarter of 2008 on fund investments valued at 793 million see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for further discussion about the recognition of impairments to our investments in sponsored mutual funds 

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts may often involve costs that precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management 

results of operations 

2008 versus 2007  investment advisory revenues decreased 63 or 118 million to 176 billion in 2008 as average assets under our management decreased 16 billion to 3582 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 492 basis points in 2008 down from the 502 basis points earned in 2007 as lower equity market valuations resulted in a greater percentage of our assets under management being attributable to lower fee fixed income portfolios continuing stress on the financial markets and resulting lower equity valuations in subsequent quarters will result in lower average assets under our management lower investment advisory fees and lower net income as compared to prior periods 

  net revenues decreased 5 or 112 million to 212 billion operating expenses were 127 billion in 2008 up 29 or 36 million from 2007 net operating income for 2008 decreased 1479 million or 148 to 8485 million higher operating expenses in 2008 and decreased market valuations during the latter half of 2008 which lowered our assets under management and advisory revenues resulted in our 2008 operating margin declining to 401 from 447 in 2007 nonoperating investment losses in 2008 were 523 million as compared to investment income of 804 million in 2007 investment losses in 2008 include noncash charges of 913 million for the other than temporary impairment of certain of the firm’s investments in sponsored mutual funds net income in 2008 fell 27 or nearly 180 million from 2007 diluted earnings per share also decreased to 182 down 58 or 242 from last year the nonoperating charge to recognize other than temporary impairments reduced diluted earnings per share by 21 in 2008 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states decreased 85 or 1145 million to 124 billion average mutual fund assets were 2161 billion in 2008 down 167 billion from 2007 mutual fund assets at december 31 2008 were 1644 billion down 816 billion from the end of 2007 

net inflows to the mutual funds during 2008 were 39 billion including 19 billion to the money funds 11 billion to the bond funds and 9 billion to the stock funds the value equity index 500 and emerging markets stock funds combined to add 41 billion while the midcap growth and equity income stock funds had net redemptions of 22 billion net fund inflows of 62 billion originated in our targetdate retirement funds which in turn invest in other t rowe price funds fund net inflow amounts in 2008 are presented net of 13 billion that was transferred to targetdate trusts from the retirement funds during the year decreases in market valuations and income not reinvested lowered our mutual fund assets under management by 855 billion during 2008 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage decreased 36 million to 5222 million average assets in these portfolios were 1421 billion during 2008 up slightly from 1414 billion in 2007 these minor changes each less than 1 are attributable to the timing of declining equity market valuations and cash flows among our separate account and subadvised portfolios net inflows primarily from institutional investors were 132 billion during 2008 including the 13 billion transferred from the retirement funds to targetdate trusts decreases in market valuations net of income lowered our assets under management in these portfolios by 553 billion during 2008 

administrative fees increased 58 million to 3539 million primarily from increased costs of servicing activities for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to provide services to the funds and their investors 

our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 184 million or 23 from 2007 this increase includes 372 million in salaries resulting from an 84 increase in our average staff count and an increase of our associates’ base salaries at the beginning of the year at december 31 2008 we employed 5385 associates up 60 from the end of 2007 primarily to add capabilities and support increased volumerelated activities and other growth over the past few years over the course of 2008 we slowed the growth of our associate base from earlier plans and the prior year we do not expect the number of our associates to increase in 2009 we also reduced our annual bonuses 276 million versus the 2007 year in response to recent and ongoing unfavorable financial market conditions that negatively impacted our operating results the balance of the increase is attributable to higher employee benefits and employmentrelated expenses including an increase of 57 million in stockbased compensation entering 2009 we did not increase the salaries of our highest paid associates 

after higher spending during the first quarter of 2008 versus 2007 investor sentiment in the uncertain and volatile market environment caused us to reduce advertising and promotion spending which for the year was down 38 million from 2007 we expect to reduce these expenditures for 2009 versus 2008 and estimate that spending in the first quarter of 2009 will be down about 5 million from the fourth quarter of 2008 we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 18 million or 12 compared to 2007 we have been expanding and renovating our facilities to accommodate the growth in our associates to meet business demands 

other operating expenses were up 33 million from 2007 we increased our spending 98 million primarily for professional fees and information and other thirdparty services reductions in travel and charitable contributions partially offset these increases 

our nonoperating investment activity resulted in a net loss of 523 million in 2008 as compared to a net gain of 804 million in 2007 this change of 1327 million is primarily attributable to losses recognized in 2008 on our investments in sponsored mutual funds which resulted from declines in financial market values during the year 

 

we recognized other than temporary impairments of our investments in sponsored mutual funds because of declines in fair value below cost for an extended period the significant declines in fair value below cost that occurred in 2008 were generally attributable to the adverse and ongoing market conditions discussed in the background section above see also the discussion below of critical accounting policies for other than temporary impairments of availableforsale securities 

  in addition income from money market and bond fund holdings was 193 million lower than in 2007 due to the significantly lower interest rate environment of 2008 lower interest rates also led to substantial capital appreciation on our 40 million holding of us treasury notes that we sold in december 2008 at a 26 million gain 

the 2008 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 384 up from 377 in 2007 primarily to reflect changes in state income tax rates and regulations and certain adjustments made prospectively based on our annual income tax return filings for 2007 we currently estimate that our 2009 effective tax rate will be similar to the 2008 effective rate 

2007 versus 2006  investment advisory revenues were up 25 or 3706 million to nearly 19 billion as average assets under our management increased 745 billion to 3742 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 502 basis points during 2007 virtually unchanged from the 503 basis points earned during 2006 

net revenues increased 23 or 4133 million to 22 billion operating expenses were 12 billion in 2007 up 20 or 2038 million from 2006 overall net operating income for 2007 increased 2095 million or almost 27 to 9964 million our operating margin was 447 in 2007 up from 434 in 2006 net income increased 1410 million or almost 27 to 6706 million for 2007 boosting diluted earnings per share more than 26 from 190 to 240 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 24 or 2602 million to more than 13 billion average mutual fund assets were 2328 billion in 2007 an increase of 24 over the average for 2006 mutual fund assets increased 395 billion during 2007 

net inflows to the mutual funds were 202 billion during 2007 our us stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of 99 billion our bond funds added 42 billion our international and global stock funds added 47 billion and our money market funds added 14 billion seven funds each added more than 14 billion and in total account for 156 billion of the net inflows the growth stock fund added more than 48 billion the new income and equity index 500 funds together added 46 billion and the blue chip growth value overseas stock and new asia funds together attracted net inflows of 62 billion higher market valuations and income net of dividends not reinvested increased fund assets by 193 billion net fund inflows of 107 billion originated in our targetdate retirement funds which in turn invest in other t rowe price funds 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 1104 million or almost 27 to 5258 million average assets in these portfolios were 1414 billion in 2007 up 26 from the 2006 average other investment portfolio assets increased 258 billion during 2007 including more than 136 billion of net inflows from us and international institutional investors and thirdparty financial intermediaries and 122 billion from market gains and income 

administrative fees increased 427 million to 3481 million the change in these revenues includes 104 million from 12b1 distribution fees recognized on greater assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to distribute the advisor and r class fund shares through third party financial intermediaries and to provide services to the funds and their investors 

our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 1388 million or 21 over 2006 the largest part of the increase is attributable to a 553 million increase in our annual bonus compensation which is based on our operating results and considers our relative and riskadjusted investment performance our growth in assets under management and net investor inflows and the high quality of our investor services the 2007 costs also include an increase of 375 million in salaries which results from a 9 increase in our average staff size coupled with an increase of our associates’ base salaries at the beginning of the year at december 31 2007 we employed 5081 associates up 103 from the beginning of 2007 and 43 from the 2007 average primarily to handle increased volumerelated activities and other growth other employee benefits and employment expenses including an increase of 188 million in noncash stockbased compensation account for the remainder of the change in our compensation and related costs 

advertising and promotion expenditures increased 106 million from 2006 in response to greater investor interest occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 165 million we are expanding and renovating our facilities to accommodate additional associates to meet greater business demands 

other operating expenses were up 379 million or 26 including 104 million of higher distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries that distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares these distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b1 fees discussed above additionally consulting and professional fees travel information services and other costs rose in 2007 to meet increased business demands 

our nonoperating income which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses increased 90 million our larger mutual fund investments added 204 million in 2007 including 134 million of increased capital gain distributions from the funds additionally 2006 included a gain of 122 million upon the liquidation of a sponsored collateralized bond obligation that did not recur 

the 2007 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was recognized using a rate of 377 down slightly from the 383 rate for the year 2006 that included provisions of 6 for the anticipated settlement of prior years’ taxes 

  capital resources and liquidity 

during 2008 stockholders’ equity decreased from nearly 28 billion to about 25 billion we repurchased 6 billion of our common stock during the year tangible book value is 18 billion at december 31 2008 and cash and mutual fund investments exceed 11 billion given the availability of these financial resources we do not maintain an available external source of liquidity 

operating activities during 2008 provided cash flows of nearly 742 million down 16 million from 2007 reconciling items include lower net income of almost 180 million that was offset by timing differences of about 59 million in the cash settlement of our operating receivables and payables other than temporary impairments of our sponsored mutual fund investments totaling 91 million greater depreciation expense on our increased property and equipment of 8 million and nearly 6 million of additional stockbased compensation account for the remainder of the difference between 2007 and 2008 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 125 million in 2008 down 220 million from 2007 in 2007 we invested a net of 1755 million in our sponsored mutual funds from our available cash resources on a net basis we added only 26 million to our fund holdings in 2008 however we made 95 million of changes to the composition of our portfolio of mutual fund holdings in light of market conditions during the year because of an increase in savings bank deposits we also increased our investment in debt securities held by the savings bank by 41 million in 2008 while we made other investments of 23 million in 2007 we made only 10 million of other investments in 2008 we also received proceeds of 426 million on the sales and 30 million on the maturities of our 70 million us treasury notes portfolio 

net cash used in financing activities was 783 million in 2008 up 382 million from 2007 our strong cash position allowed us to increase our common stock repurchases by 302 million in 2008 versus 2007 our cash outflows for dividends paid increased 132 million during the first quarter of 2008 we changed our policy regarding the timing of dividend payments such that our quarterly dividends are now declared and paid in the same quarter accordingly our cash outflows for 2008 include the payout of dividends for the fourth quarter 2007 and all four quarters of 2008 additionally we increased the quarterly dividend payment from 17 per share made in each of the four 2007 quarters to 24 per share beginning with the payment made in january 2008 lastly deposits at our savings bank subsidiary increased nearly 44 million in 2008 as depositors sought the security of fdicbacked accounts 

operating activities during 2007 provided cash flows of 758 million up 165 million from 2006 including increased net income of 141 million and noncash stockbased compensation expense of 19 million net cash used in investing activities totaled 345 million down nearly 77 million from 2006 our investments in mutual funds and other securities made from our larger available cash balances was 214 million in 2007 down 112 million from 2006 increased capital spending for property and equipment was 146 million in 2007 up 51 million versus 2006 net cash used in financing activities was 401 million in 2007 up 199 million from 2006 we increased our expenditures for common stock repurchases by 141 million and our dividends paid to stockholders by 33 million 

property and equipment expenditures in 2009 are anticipated to be about 190 million and are expected to be funded from cash balances 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2008 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are generally of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2009 and future years the information also excludes the 6 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period in which a payment might be made to the tax authorities 

 

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional investments totaling 315 million at december 31 2008 

  critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2008 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

other than temporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as availableforsale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss as a component of comprehensive income loss within the statement of stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

a mutual fund holding with an impairment that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our statement of income if we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security any determination of this type would consider the issuer’s financial condition and our ability and intent to hold the investment until its fair value recovers which may mean until maturity and to collect all contractual cash flows minor impairments of 5 or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit — our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds our carrying amount basically our stockholders’ equity and therefore that no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet 6657 million 

stock options  we recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using a fair value based method fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration the blackscholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as our estimates change and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior year adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

  newly issued but not yet adopted accounting standards 

each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted standards applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements we do not believe that any issued standard that we have not yet adopted will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues net income and earnings per share changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels our estimated effective income tax rate and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a risk factors of this annual report further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements nonoperating investment income loss will also fluctuate primarily due to the size of our investments and changes in their market valuations 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants other incentive awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management accordingly declines in financial market values like those experienced since september 2008 directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues as well as our investment income and net income 

we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive financial instruments primarily for purposes other than trading we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

  the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund’s lowest net asset value per share during 2008 in considering this presentation it is important to note that not all funds experienced their lowest net asset value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

 

the comparable potential loss of value presented in our 2007 annual report was 678 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 7712 million that included a net unrealized gain of 147 million at december 31 2007 during 2008 we actually experienced net losses of 2547 million including 913 million of other than temporary impairments recognized in our nonoperating investment income loss 

financial market conditions have recently been extremely volatile and financial security valuations have declined similarly our portfolio of investments in sponsored mutual funds at december 31 2008 includes a net unrealized loss of 175 million including gross unrealized losses totaling 403 million unrealized losses incurred in the second half of 2008 totaling 301 million on investments valued at 1159 million at december 31 2008 have been temporarily impaired on a continuous basis from september 30 2008 the remaining unrealized losses totaling 102 million were incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 on fund investments valued at 793 million 

because our fund holdings are considered availableforsale securities we recognize unrealized losses that are considered temporary in other comprehensive income we review the carrying amount of each investment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment charge in nonoperating investment income loss whenever an unrealized loss is considered other than temporary a mutual fund holding with an impairment that has persisted daily throughout the six months between quarterends is generally presumed to have an other than temporary impairment unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption it is possible that we will determine at march 31 2009 or at a subsequent quarter end that unrealized losses in one or more of our mutual fund investments have become otherthantemporary impairments we could also sell our fund positions before a subsequent quarterend reporting date and recognize in our income statement previously unrealized losses the amount and timing of any subsequent charge will be dependent on future market performance 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 

we also hold other investments of 419 million at december 31 2008 that we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount should market conditions deteriorate 

we operate in several foreign countries most prominent among which is great britain we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in us dollars we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

 item 1 business 

t rowe price group is a financial services holding company that derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

we operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies primarily t rowe price associates t rowe price international and t rowe price global investment services the late thomas rowe price jr began our advisory business in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in late 2000 

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base across four primary distribution channels thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and other countries individual us investors on a direct basis us defined contribution retirement plans and institutional investors in the us and other countries 

we manage a broad range of us and international stock bond blended asset and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors mutual fund shareholders can exchange balances among mutual funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change 

from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund if we believe that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund in order to maintain the integrity of the fund’s investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders at present the following funds are closed to new investors 

 

these funds continue to attract cash inflows from existing fund shareholders and direct rollovers from retirement plans into new ira accounts that we offer 

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus investment management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global or international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity investment strategies as well as active systematic and municipal taxfree management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities received from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the united states and great britain with additional staff resident in argentina hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market and security analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling 

 2  

  we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds discount brokerage and trust services more than 90 of our administrative revenues in 2007 were determined based on the recovery of expenses incurred to provide the related services administrative revenues therefore do not significantly affect our net income 

information concerning our revenues results of operations total assets and investment assets under our management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial statements and in note 2 thereto which are both included in item 8 of this form 10k 

2007 developments 

total assets under our management increased 65 billion over the course of 2007 and ended the year at an alltime record of 400 billion including 275 billion held in retirement accounts and variable annuity investment portfolios our yearend assets under management include 322 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 78 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the investment portfolios that we manage consist of 246 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 154 billion in other investment portfolios including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans in the us nonus dollar denominated securities account for about 65 billion of our yearend assets under management 

the firm’s investment advisory results relative to our peers remain strong with at least 72 of the t rowe price funds across their share classes surpassing their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the three five and 10year periods ended december 31 2007 and 61 outperforming for the oneyear period in addition 71 of the t rowe price stock bond and blended asset funds across their share classes which account for more than 72 of our rated funds’ assets under management ended the year with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar these four and fivestarrated investments represent 582 of our rated funds and share classes compared with 325 for the overall industry 

our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to investors entrusting a net of nearly 34 billion to our management in 2007 thirdparty financial intermediaries institutional investors around the world and our targetdate retirement funds were the most significant sources of these net inflows higher market valuations and income added more than 31 billion 

assets under management in our series of targetdate retirement funds which provide fund shareholders with single diversified portfolios that invest in underlying t rowe price funds and automatically adjust fund asset allocations as investors age increased 73 or 127 billion during 2007 to total 30 billion or 12 of our mutual fund assets under management at year end 

six of the price funds each had more than 10 billion of net assets at december 31 2007 these funds — growth stock equity income midcap growth blue chip growth capital appreciation and equity index 500 — accounted for 25 of assets under management at the end of the year and 275 of 2007 investment advisory revenues 

our international clients account for 9 of our total assets under management at december 31 2007 up from 7 at the beginning of the year 

price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

advisory services  investment advisory revenues are based upon the net assets managed daily in each fund additional revenues are earned for advisoryrelated administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid by each of the price funds generally is computed each day by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee for the majority of the price funds the fee is equal to the sum of an individual fund charge that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective and a group charge that is set based on the aggregate net assets of those funds the individual fund charge for each of our four largest funds — growth stock equity income midcap growth and blue chip growth – is a weighted average determined by applying a 15 reduction for net assets in excess of 15 billion to the base individual fund rate the group charge is a tiered based schedule the effective group charge when combined net assets exceed 220 billion is calculated based on a weightedaverage fee across pricing tiers of almost 305 basis points for the first 220 billion of net assets plus 285 basis points for net assets in excess of 220 billion 

 3  

  our 2007 fee rates determined in the above manner varied from a low of 30 basis points for the us treasury funds to a high of 105 basis points for the emerging markets stock emerging europe  mediterranean international discovery and latin america funds to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of a fund’s advisory fee and therefore the advisory fee paid by each fund will decrease details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios 

certain of the t rowe price mutual funds also offer advisor and r classes of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the t rowe price mutual funds and enters into agreements with each intermediary payment of 12b1 fees is made by each fund directly to the applicable intermediaries 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding administrative revenue in our consolidated statement of income we also recognize as part of our other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income the corresponding payment of these fees from each fund to the thirdparty financial intermediaries the revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third party intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

several of the price funds have different fee arrangements the equity market index funds and the summit funds each have single allinclusive fees covering all investment management and operating expenses each of the funds in the series of spectrum funds and in the series of targetdate retirement funds invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest mutual funds for institutional investors each have separate advisory fee arrangements 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of the selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in the print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including enhancements to our web site 

administrative services we provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds through our subsidiaries t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities and technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the price funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the funds 

our trustee services are provided by another subsidiary t rowe price trust company through this marylandchartered limitedservice trust company we offer common trust funds for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for retirement plans and iras t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans another subsidiary t rowe price savings bank issues federally insured certificates of deposit

  we also provide advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services such as saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement an investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist an investor in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals 

fund assets at december 31 2007 assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 246 billion an increase of 19 or 395 billion from the beginning of the year the following table presents the net assets in billions of our largest funds net assets in excess of 5 billion and the year each fund was started the spectrum and retirement series of funds are not listed in the table because their assets are included in the underlying funds

we invest in many of the t rowe price funds through our operating subsidiaries and our investments holding company subsidiary trp finance 

other investment portfolios we managed 154 billion at december 31 2007 in other client investment portfolios up almost 26 billion from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios such as common trust funds luxembourgbased mutual funds and variable annuity life insurance plans at december 31 these portfolios included the following investment assets 

 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management in 2007 nearly 55 of these advisory fees were recognized based on daily valuations the balance of these managed investment portfolios are generally billed quarterly end of billing period valuations generated about 40 of the 2007 advisory fees from other managed portfolios while beginning of billing period values were the basis for about 5 of these fees 

we charge fees for investment management based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded 

our largest client account relationship excluding the t rowe price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for more than 3 of our investment advisory revenues in 2007

  all aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations these laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and the price funds’ shareholders they generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to comply with laws and regulations possible sanctions that may be imposed on us in the event that we fail to comply include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain business activities for specified periods of time revocation of our investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements including those of various federal state and foreign regulatory agencies our subsidiaries’ net capital as defined meets or exceeds all minimum requirements 

competition as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks and other financial institutions in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services 

we believe that competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions or negotiations that could lead to acquisitions or new financial relationships 

employees at december 31 2007 we employed 5081 associates up 103 from the end of 2006 we may add additional temporary and parttime personnel to our staff from time to time to meet periodic and special project demands primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative services

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from timetotime in our periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with money market securities at the low end and nonus dollar denominated bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

•investor mobility our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time on very short notice and without any significant penalty 

•general market declines a general downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management 

•investment performance if the investment performance of our managed portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable thirdparty benchmarks we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management institutional investors in particular consider changing investment advisers based upon poor relative investment performance individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance 

•global economies national and international political and economic events may cause financial market declines that lower the value of assets under our management and may cause investors to withdraw funds 

 7  

  •investing trends changes in investing trends and in particular retirement savings trends may reduce interest in our funds and portfolios and may alter our mix of assets 

•interest rate changes investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates 

•tax regulation changes changes in the status of tax deferred retirement plan investments and taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates and regulations could adversely affect investor behavior and may cause investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or an adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period 

a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60day notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

•asset management firms 

•mutual fund companies 

•commercial banks and thrift institutions 

•insurance companies 

•hedge funds 

•exchange traded funds 

•brokerage and investment banking firms and 

•other financial institutions including multinational firms and subsidiaries of diversified conglomerates 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of financial products across more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them we believe that competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income if we are required to lower our fees in order to remain competitive our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed especially over shorter periods of time and others may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts management and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry financial services professionals are in high demand and we face significant competition for qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

 8  

  certain of the price funds and other investment portfolios are vulnerable to marketspecific risks that could adversely affect investment performance our reputation and our revenues 

several of the price funds and investment portfolios for example emerging market investments are subject to political and economic instability wide exchangerate fluctuations illiquid and highly volatile markets and other risks that could materially decrease the investment returns available in foreign markets a significant decrease in the investment return or net asset value of any price fund or investment portfolio could harm our reputation and cause a decrease in assets under management including client asset withdrawals the result could be a material decline in our revenues and net income 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse affect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties and litigation 

operating risks include 

•failure to properly perform fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities including portfolio accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations and required distributions to fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations 

•failure to properly perform transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities including transaction processing tax reporting and record retention and failure to identify excessive trading in mutual funds by our customers or plan participants 

•sales and marketing risks including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of products and services in advertising materials public relations information or other external communications and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

•changes in the level of our advertising expenses including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the united states and further penetrating us distribution channels 

•variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants and other stockbased awards changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors 

•a future impairment of goodwill that is recognized in our balance sheet 

•material fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad 

•expenses and capital costs incurred to enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development 

•unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill and 

•disruptions of thirdparty services such as communications power and mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

under our agreements with our mutual funds we charge our mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not otherwise paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

more than 30 of our assets under management are sourced from our largest distribution channel thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and abroad these intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on third party financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and their client assets under our management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third party intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

 9  

  natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

•decreasing investment valuations in and returns on the investment portfolios that we manage 

•causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive 

•inflicting losses in human capital 

•interrupting our business operations 

•triggering technology delays or failures and 

•requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage replace our facilities and restore our operations 

we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose any employees or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to continue our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in our stock bond and blended asset mutual funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our income from these investments could be adversely affected by a decline in value in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our corporate investments including the impact of market conditions and the size of our corporate money market and longerterm mutual fund holdings fluctuations in other investment income can be expected to occur in the future 

the investment performance of our savings bank subsidiary could adversely affect our assets and results of operations 

we have a savings bank subsidiary that accepts time deposits from customers pays a fixed rate of interest to them and invests in assetbacked debt securities although we generally hold these investments to maturity on a basis which correlates to the maturities of our customer deposits fluctuations in interest rates could result in otherthantemporary impairments among the fixed income investments and could result in a mismatch between the interest rate return on our investment portfolio and the interest paid on our customer deposits to the extent that this occurs our assets and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may elect to pursue growth in the united states and abroad through acquisitions or joint ventures which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations and in expanding into new jurisdictions 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities we cannot assure that we will identify and consummate any such transactions on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy in addition any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping operating facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

we are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in great britain and selfregulatory organizations such as the financial industry regulatory authority finra the conduct of our business is in large part dictated by adherence to such regulation including federal laws such as the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the usa patriot act of 2001 the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa regulations relating to the mutual fund industry specifically and securities laws generally accounting standards and banking and tax laws compliance with these complex regulations and our disclosure and financial reporting obligations requires significant investments of time and money and could limit our ability to enter into new lines of business further the regulations imposed by one jurisdiction may conflict with the regulations imposed by another and these differences may be difficult or impossible to reconcile 

 10  

  our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden cause a loss of mutual fund investors and reduce our revenues 

because of trading abuses that were uncovered earlier this decade at several investment management firms regulators have shown increasing interest in the oversight of the mutual fund and investment advisory industry federal agencies have adopted regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry and more rules can be expected in the future that could place greater compliance and administrative burdens on us which could increase our expenses without increasing revenues in addition new regulations could require the price funds to reduce the level of certain mutual fund fees paid to us or require us to bear additional expenses which would affect our operating results further adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund and investment advisory firms could tarnish the reputation of mutual funds and investment advisers generally causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their balances redemptions would decrease the assets under our management which would reduce our advisory revenues and net income 

we may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims there also has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot assure that our insurance will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available on acceptable terms certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum requirements however a significant operating loss or extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios investment advisory clients outside the united states account for 9 of our assets under management at december 31 2007 

we manage a broad range of us and international stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

the implosion of the subprime mortgage market in 2007 had a major impact on the financial markets defaults and delinquencies rose in the early part of the year and by the summer major wall street firms and commercial banks with exposure to subprime mortgages were reporting substantial losses liquidity in the assetbacked commercial paper market evaporated in august because fears of additional losses discouraged banks from lending to each other in response the federal reserve reduced shortterm interest rates by 50 basis points in september the first reduction since june 2003 and signaled its continuing readiness to inject additional reserves into the us banking system to boost liquidity and dampen the impact of market disruptions on the economy two more 25 basis point reductions in the fourth quarter reduced the target rate to 425 at yearend 2007 

concerns about generally slower corporate profit growth and rising energy and materials prices also weighed on the stock markets in 2007 and the leveraged buyout market slowed significantly in the second half of the year with several announced deals not closing due to tighter lending conditions 

in this environment us equities produced mixed returns for 2007 with the broad sp 500 index of largecap companies in leading industries of the us economy reaching a new high as late as midjuly market volatility however was extremely high in the last six months of the year and in the fourth quarter the sp 500 index suffered its first correction — a drop of 10 or more — in about five years for the year the sp 500 index returned 55 the nasdaq composite index which is heavily weighted with technology companies that fared better than many other sectors in 2007 rose 98 excluding dividends 

stocks outside the united states fared better than their us counterparts in 2007 emerging markets led by equities in latin america substantially outperformed other foreign stocks developed european markets produced solid gains but japanese shares declined the msci emerging markets index returned 398 during 2007 while the msci eafe index which measures the performance of mostly largecap stocks in europe australasia and the far east returned 116 during the year 

the yield on 10year us treasuries was 404 at the end of 2007 down 67 basis points from 471 at the end of 2006 with the federal reserve rate reductions us treasury bonds produced strong returns in 2007 as investors sought a safer haven away from the volatility of the equity and corporate debt markets in these highest quality fixedincome securities investmentgrade corporate bonds also performed well as prices rose and yields declined 

while 2007 was a reasonable year overall for the global financial markets equities around the world declined dramatically in the early weeks of january 2008 weakerthanexpected economic data particularly on us employment and retail spending and the restraining effect of bank capital writedowns on credit availability combined to raise the downside risk in the nearterm economic outlook this risk may be mitigated to some extent by a forceful further easing of us monetary policy that over nine days reduced the federal funds rate by 125 basis points to 30 as of january 30 and an expected fiscal stimulus package from the us congress and president as always we caution investors to be patient as the market goes through a period of transition and adjustment and to have modest market return expectations and an awareness of risk and uncertainty 

in the unsettled financial environment of 2007 total assets under our management ended the year at a record 4000 billion up 653 billion or 195 during 2007 over the last three years our assets under management in billions have increased as follows 

 

 15  

  during the last three years our assets under management have increased across each of our four distribution channels the largest increases were sourced from thirdparty financial intermediaries and from institutional investors around the world our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness have contributed significantly to attracting investor net inflows 

assets under management at december 31 2007 include 3216 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 784 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the investment portfolios that we manage consist of 2460 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1540 billion in other investment portfolios including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 

we incur significant expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts involve costs that generally precede any future revenues that we may recognize from increases to our assets under management 

results of operations 

2007 versus 2006  investment advisory revenues were up 25 or 3706 million to nearly 19 billion as average assets under our management increased 745 billion to 3742 billion the average annualized fee rate earned on our assets under management was 502 basis points during 2007 virtually unchanged from the 503 basis points earned during 2006 

net revenues increased 23 or 4133 million to 22 billion operating expenses were 12 billion in 2007 up 20 or 2038 million from 2006 overall net operating income for 2007 increased 2095 million or almost 27 to 9964 million our operating margin was 447 in 2007 up from 434 in 2006 net income increased 1410 million or almost 27 to 6706 million for 2007 boosting diluted earnings per share more than 26 from 190 to 240 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 24 or 2602 million to more than 13 billion average mutual fund assets were 2328 billion in 2007 an increase of 24 over the average for 2006 mutual fund assets increased 395 billion during 2007 

net inflows to the mutual funds were 202 billion during 2007 our us stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of 99 billion our bond funds added 42 billion our international and global stock funds added 47 billion and our money market funds added 14 billion seven funds each added more than 14 billion and in total account for 156 billion of the net inflows the growth stock fund added more than 48 billion the new income and equity index 500 funds together added 46 billion and the blue chip growth value overseas stock and new asia funds together attracted net inflows of 62 billion higher market valuations and income net of dividends not reinvested increased fund assets by 193 billion net fund inflows of 107 billion originated in our targetdate retirement funds which in turn invest in other t rowe price funds 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 1104 million or almost 27 to 5258 million average assets in these portfolios were 1414 billion in 2007 up 26 from the 2006 average other investment portfolio assets increased 258 billion during 2007 including more than 136 billion of net inflows from us and international institutional investors and thirdparty financial intermediaries and 122 billion from market gains and income 

administrative fees increased 427 million to 3481 million the change in these revenues includes 104 million from 12b1 distribution fees recognized on greater assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to our mutual fund servicing activities and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that are incurred to distribute the advisor and r class fund shares through third party financial intermediaries and to provide services to the funds and their investors 

our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 1388 million or 21 over 2006 the largest part of the increase is attributable to a 553 million increase in our annual bonus compensation which is based on our operating results and considers our relative and riskadjusted investment performance our growth in assets under management and net investor inflows and the high quality of our investor services the 2007 costs also include an increase of 375 million in salaries which results from a 9 increase in our average staff size coupled with an increase of our associates’ base salaries at the beginning of the year at december 31 2007 we employed 5081 associates up 103 from the beginning of 2007 and 43 from the 2007 average primarily to handle increased volumerelated activities and other growth other employee benefits and employment expenses including an increase of 188 million in noncash stockbased compensation account for the remainder of the change in our compensation and related costs 

advertising and promotion expenditures increased 106 million from 2006 in response to greater investor interest we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in 2008 will be up about 15 versus 2007 and spending in the first quarter of 2008 to increase about 2 million from the fourth quarter of 2007 we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 165 million we are expanding and renovating our facilities to accommodate additional associates to meet greater business demands 

other operating expenses were up 379 million or 26 including 104 million of higher distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries that distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares these distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b1 fees discussed above additionally consulting and professional fees travel information services and other costs have risen this year to meet increased business demands 

our nonoperating income which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses increased 90 million our larger mutual fund investments added 204 million in 2007 including 134 million of increased capital gain distributions from the funds additionally 2006 included a gain of 122 million upon the liquidation of a sponsored collateralized bond obligation that did not recur 

 16  

  the 2007 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income has been recognized using a rate of 377 down slightly from the 383 rate for the year 2006 but in line with the estimate made at the beginning of the year we currently estimate that our 2008 effective tax rate will increase by up to 5 due primarily to changes in state income tax rates and regulations 

2006 versus 2005  investment advisory revenues were up 22 to 15 billion as a result of a 526 billion increase in average assets under our management to 2997 billion net revenues increased 20 or 3 billion to 18 billion net operating income increased 20 to 787 million from 655 million net income increased 23 to nearly 530 million from 431 million in 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 20 from 158 to 190 all 2005 pershare information has been adjusted to retroactively reflect the twoforone split of our common stock in june 2006 

on january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment  and recognized 592 million of noncash stock optionbased compensation expense in 2006 using the fair value based method had we applied the fair value method in 2005 we would have recognized 598 million of additional stock optionbased compensation expense our comparable pro forma diluted earnings for 2005 would then have been 143 per share and our 2006 diluted earnings per share of 190 would be 33 higher than 2005 see our summary of significant accounting policies accompanying our financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 21 or 2 billion to nearly 11 billion average mutual fund assets were 1876 billion in 2006 20 higher than the 2005 average of 1562 billion mutual fund assets ended 2006 at 2065 billion 10 above the 2006 average net inflows to the mutual funds were 129 billion during 2006 including 66 billion that originated in our targetdate retirement funds and 8 billion from the merger of two fund groups into the price funds our us stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of 63 billion while our international stock funds added 28 billion and our bond and money market funds added 38 billion the growth stock fund added 42 billion of net investments this year while the value fund added more than 19 billion higher market valuations and income increased fund assets by 234 billion in 2006 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 80 million to 415 million average assets in these portfolios were 1121 billion in 2006 up 23 or 212 billion from the 2005 average yearend assets totaled 1282 billion an increase of 14 from the 2006 average and up 289 billion from the start of the year net inflows from us and international investors were 149 billion and market gains and income added 140 billion in 2005 net inflows from subadvised and separate account clients investing in us securities were partially offset by significant net outflows from investors in some of our international investment portfolios 

administrative fees and other income increased 29 million to 305 million the change in these revenues includes 52 million from 12b1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to our servicing activities including shareholder accounts and transaction volume in our transfer agent and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors 

operating expenses were 10 billion in 2006 up 171 million from 2005 our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 136 million or 26 the number of our associates their total compensation and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased the most significant portion of the increase is attributable to the 592 million noncash expense recognized for 2006 stock optionbased compensation the 2006 increase also reflects greater bonus compensation based on our strong operating results for 2006 as well as our strong relative and riskadjusted investment performance our growth in assets under management including new investor inflows and the high quality of our investor services finally we modestly increase our associates’ base salaries at the beginning of each year and increased our average staff size by 54 versus 2005 primarily to handle increased volumerelated activities and other growth at december 31 2006 we employed 4605 associates 

advertising and promotion expenditures increased 13 or 112 million due to more favorable market conditions and investor interest in 2006 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 123 million our costs for rented office facilities including increased space and related equipment maintenance and other costs increased along with our staff size and business needs 

other operating expenses were up 114 million versus 2005 including 52 million of higher distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries that distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares these distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b1 fees discussed above other operating expenses including travel costs and consulting and information services rose to meet increased business demands 

overall net operating income for 2006 increased 20 to 787 million and the operating margin was 434 up 1 from 2005 

our net nonoperating income which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses and credit facility expenses increased 47 million to 71 million larger money market mutual fund balances at higher interest rates added 205 million of the increase the liquidation of a sponsored collateralized bond obligation in 2006 added 110 million and gains on dispositions of mutual fund investments added 62 million 

the 2006 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 383 up from 366 in 2005 our 2006 income tax provision includes provisions of 6 or 48 million for the anticipated settlement of prior years’ taxes 3 for increased state taxes and 3 for the effect of nondeductible incentive stock optionbased compensation expense that we began recognizing in our 2006 operating results the 2006 provision also does not include the 2 benefit that we recognized in 2005 for the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards

  capital resources and liquidity 

during 2007 stockholders’ equity increased from 24 billion to nearly 28 billion cash and investment holdings exceed 16 billion at december 31 2007 

operating activities during 2007 provided cash flows of 758 million up 165 million from 2006 including increased net income of 141 million and noncash stockbased compensation expense of 19 million net cash used in investing activities totaled 345 million down nearly 77 million from 2006 our investments in mutual funds and other securities made from our larger available cash balances was 214 million in 2007 down 112 million from 2006 increased capital spending for property and equipment was 146 million in 2007 up 51 million versus 2006 net cash used in financing activities was 401 million in 2007 up 199 million from 2006 we increased our expenditures for common stock repurchases by 141 million and our dividends paid to stockholders by 33 million 

operating activities during 2006 provided cash flows of 593 million up 54 million from 2005 including increased net income of 99 million and noncash stockbased compensation expense of 58 million timing differences in the cash settlements of our assets and liabilities reduced comparative cash flows by 107 million net cash used in investing activities totaled 421 million up 330 million from 2005 our investments in mutual funds and other securities made from our larger available cash balances were 272 million more in 2006 than in 2005 capital spending for property and equipment was 94 million in 2006 up 42 million versus 2005 net cash used in financing activities was 203 million in 2006 up 59 million from 2005 we increased our expenditures for common stock repurchases by 95 million and our dividends paid to stockholders by 28 million offsetting these outflows were nearly 66 million of tax benefits realized from option exercises and restricted stock vesting in 2006 

property and equipment expenditures in 2008 including those for the buildout of our expanded operating facilities are anticipated to be nearly 200 million and are expected to be funded from cash balances 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents a summary of our future obligations in millions under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2007 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2008 and future years the information also excludes the 48 million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note 8 to our consolidated financial statements because it is not possible to estimate the time period that it might be paid to tax authorities 

 

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional investments totaling 291 million at december 31 2007 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2007 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

other than temporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we generally classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as availableforsale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

 18  

  a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our statement of income if we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security any determination of this type would consider the issuer’s financial condition and our ability and intent to hold the investment until its fair value recovers which may mean until maturity and to collect all contractual cash flows minor impairments of 5 or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary 

goodwill  we internally conduct manage and report our operations as one investment advisory business we do not have distinct operating segments or components that separately constitute a business accordingly we attribute goodwill to a single reportable business segment and reporting unit — our investment advisory business 

we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds our carrying amount basically our stockholders’ equity and therefore that no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet 6657 million 

stock options  on january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas 123r and began recognizing stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using the fair value based method prior to 2006 our stock option grants were accounted for using the intrinsic value based method and no compensation expense related to our option grants was recognized in our consolidated statements of income the recognition of stock optionbased compensation expense had a material impact on our operating results in 2007 and 2006 and on comparability to our operating results in 2005 because we elected the modified prospective application of adopting sfas 123r the summary of significant accounting policies accompanying our consolidated financial statements includes comparable pro forma disclosures for 2005 as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize stock optionbased compensation expense 

fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration the blackscholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in numerous states and countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred in doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as our estimates change and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior year adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

newly issued but not yet adopted accounting standards 

each reporting period we consider all newly issued but not yet adopted standards applicable to our operations and the preparation of our consolidated statements one such standard sfas no 157 fair value measurements  will add additional note disclosures to our 2008 financial statements about the valuation of our investments in sponsored mutual funds and debt securities held by our savings bank subsidiary adoption of sfas no 157 will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants stock awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management accordingly declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income 

we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive financial instruments primarily for purposes other than trading we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds that are accounted for as availableforsale securities by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund’s lowest fair value per share during 2007 in considering this presentation it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

 

the comparable potential loss of value presented in our 2006 annual report was 643 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 5544 million at december 31 2006 during 2007 we actually experienced net unrealized gains of 439 million 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 

we also hold other investments of 1023 million at december 31 2007 that we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount should market conditions deteriorate us treasury holdings generally considered to be of the lowest risk profile account for 706 million of these investments 

we operate in several foreign countries most prominent among which is great britain we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenues are predominately realized in us dollars we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

 item 1 business 

t rowe price group is a financial services holding company that derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

we operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies primarily t rowe price associates t rowe price international and t rowe price global investment services the late thomas rowe price jr began our advisory business in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in late 2000 

total assets under our management increased 652 billion over the course of 2006 and ended the year at an alltime record of 3347 billion including more than 230 billion held in retirement accounts and variable annuity investment portfolios assets under our management at the end of 2006 included 2670 billion of equity and blended asset portfolios and 677 billion of fixed income portfolios the five largest price funds at december 31 2006 — equity income growth stock midcap growth blue chip growth and capital appreciation — accounted for 23 of assets under management at that time and 27 of 2006 investment advisory revenues 

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base that is accessed across four primary distribution methods our assets under management are sourced approximately 2030 from each of the following thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and other countries individual us investors on a direct basis us defined contribution retirement plans and institutional investors in the us and other countries our largest client account relationship excluding the t rowe price funds accounted for nearly 4 of our investment advisory revenues in 2006 our international clients account for 7 of our total assets under management at december 31 2006 

we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors for example mutual fund shareholders can exchange balances among mutual funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change 

from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund if we believe that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period 

conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund in order to maintain the integrity of the fund’s investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders at present the following funds are closed to new investors 

 

these funds continue to attract cash inflows from existing fund shareholders and direct rollovers from retirement plans into new ira accounts that we offer 

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus investment management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds as well as other strategies undertaken on behalf of certain institutional clients equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global or international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity investment strategies as well as active systematic and municipal taxfree management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities received from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

 2  

  we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the united states and great britain with additional staff resident in argentina hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market and security analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling 

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds discount brokerage and trust services 

about 90 of our administrative revenues in 2006 were determined based on the recovery of expenses incurred to provide the related services administrative revenues therefore do not significantly affect our net income 

information concerning our revenues results of operations total assets and investment assets under our management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial statements and in note 2 thereto which are both included in item 8 of this form 10k 

2006 developments 

an unsettled environment surrounded the equity markets in the united states during the first seven months of 2006 the positive sentiment evoked by early january indications from the federal reserve that its series of tightening moves was slowing and nearing an end was soon tempered as the fed again raised its target shortterm rate 25 at the end of january it then added three more successive increases of 25 so that the target shortterm rate was 525 at june 30 by the end of july the equity markets were all posting yeartodate losses the trend reversed in early august when the federal reserve discontinued its series of interest rate increases taken together with declines in energy costs and increasing optimism about the us economy a stock market rally ensued continuing through the fourth quarter and into early 2007 the dow jones industrial average was the biggest gainer in 2006 as it passed its january 2000 premarket crash record in october and closed the year up 163 other key indexes also posted strong results for 2006 as the sp 500 gained 136 and the nasdaq was up 95 

the overall positive market environment in the united states was also present around the world in 2006 with the latin america region posting the strongest equity market performance on a broader basis the msci eafe europe australasia and far east index rose 235 during the year 

the yield for 10year us treasuries was 47 at december 31 2006 up from nearly 44 at the start of the year but down from the high of more than 52 in june the yield curve was inverted at yearend 2006 with the sixmonth and twoyear maturities yielding 38 and 11 basis points more respectively than the 10year treasuries the federal reserve target shortterm rate of 525 has remained unchanged since june 2006 

in this financial environment total assets under our management ended 2006 at a record 3347 billion up 24 or 652 billion during the year our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to investors entrusting a net of 278 billion to our management in 2006 net inflows include 8 billion from the merger of two fund groups into the t rowe price funds and the acquisition of 1 billion of separate account assets higher market valuations and income added 374 billion to our assets under management in 2006 

our series of targetdate retirement funds which provide fund shareholders with single diversified portfolios that invest in underlying t rowe price funds and automatically adjust fund asset allocations as investors age continue to be the source of a significant part of our mutual fund asset growth mutual fund net inflows in 2006 include 66 billion that originated in the retirement funds total assets in the retirement funds reached 173 billion at december 31 2006 an increase of 89 billion from the end of 2005 

the firm’s investment advisory results relative to our peers remain strong with 80 of the t rowe price funds across their share classes surpassing their comparable lipper averages on a total return basis for the fiveyear period ended december 31 2006 and at least 70 outperforming the average for the one three and 10year periods in addition 78 of the t rowe price stock and bond funds across their share classes which account for more than 77 of stock and bond fund assets under management ended 2006 with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar these four and fivestar rated investments represent 66 of our rated funds and share classes compared with 325 for the overall industry 

assets under our management at december 31 2006 include 2065 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1282 billion in the other investment portfolios that we manage including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 

 3  

  price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

advisory services investment advisory revenues are based upon the daily net assets managed in each fund additional revenues are earned for advisoryrelated administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid by each of the price funds generally is computed each day by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee for the majority of the price funds the fee is equal to the sum of a group charge that is set based on the combined net assets of those funds and an individual fund charge that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective the 2006 fee rates determined in this manner varied from a low of 31 basis points for the us treasury money fund to a high of 106 basis points for the emerging markets stock emerging europe  mediterranean international discovery and latin america funds to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of the fee and each overall fund fee decreases details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios 

certain of the t rowe price mutual funds also offer an advisor andor r class of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders and defined contribution retirement plans respectively through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the t rowe price mutual funds and enters into agreements with each intermediary payment of 12b1 fees is made by each fund directly to the applicable intermediaries 

in accounting for 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding administrative revenue in our consolidated statement of income we also recognize as part of our other operating expenses in the consolidated statement of income the corresponding payment of these fees from each fund to the thirdparty financial intermediaries the revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third party intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

several of the price funds have different fee arrangements the equity market index funds and the summit funds each have single allinclusive fees covering all investment management and operating expenses each of the funds in the spectrum series and the retirement date series of mutual funds invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest mutual funds for institutional investors each have separate advisory fee arrangements 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period generally during the earlier portion of the period we will waive advisory fees and absorb other mutual fund expenses in excess of the selfimposed limits during the latter portion of the period we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in the print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including enhancements to our web site 

administrative services we provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds through our subsidiaries t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities and technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the price funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the funds

  our trustee services are provided by another subsidiary t rowe price trust company through this marylandchartered limitedservice trust company we offer common trust funds for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for retirement plans and iras t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans another subsidiary t rowe price savings bank issues federally insured certificates of deposit 

we also provide advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services are limited in scope and include three retirement planning services saving for retirement transitioning into retirement and income in retirement each with an investment portfolio evaluation service an ongoing checkup service is also available to assist investors in remaining on track to achieve their financial goals 

fund assets at december 31 2006 assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 2065 billion an increase of 21 or 363 billion from the beginning of the year the following table presents the net assets in billions of our largest funds net assets in excess of 5 billion and the year each fund was started the spectrum and retirement series of funds are not listed in the table because their assets are included in the underlying funds

other investment portfolios we managed 1282 billion at december 31 2006 in other client investment portfolios up 289 billion from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios generally organized by us such as common trust funds luxembourgbased mutual funds and variable annuity life insurance plans at december 31 these portfolios included the following investment assets 

 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management in 2006 nearly 60 of these advisory fees were recognized based on daily valuations the balance of these managed investment portfolios are generally billed quarterly end of billing period valuations generated about 35 of the 2006 advisory fees from other managed portfolios while beginning of billing period values were the basis for about 5 of these fees 

we charge fees for investment management based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded

  competition as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks and other financial institutions in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment management services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of our services 

we believe that competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions or negotiations that could lead to acquisitions or new financial relationships

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from timetotime in our other periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with money market securities at the low end and nonus bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

• investor mobility our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time on very short notice and without any significant penalty 

• general market declines a general downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management 

• investment performance if the investment performance of our managed portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable thirdparty benchmarks we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management institutional investors in particular consider changing investment advisors based upon poor relative investment performance individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance 

• global economies national and international political and economic events may cause financial market declines that lower the value of assets under our management and may cause investors to withdraw funds 

• investing trends changes in investing trends and in particular retirement savings trends may reduce interest in our funds and portfolios and may alter our mix of assets 

• interest rate changes investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates 

• tax regulation changes changes in the status of tax deferred retirement plan investments and taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates and regulations could adversely affect investor behavior and may cause investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period

  a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60day notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

• asset management firms 

• mutual fund companies 

• commercial banks and thrift institutions 

• insurance companies 

• hedge funds 

• exchange traded funds 

• brokerage and investment banking firms and 

• other financial institutions including multinational firms and subsidiaries of diversified conglomerates 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of products or operate in more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered our investment performance and the scope and quality of our investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them we believe that competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential clients decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income if we are required to lower our fees in order to remain competitive our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed especially over shorter periods of time and others may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts management and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry financial services professionals are in high demand and we face significant competition for qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

certain of the price funds and other investment portfolios are vulnerable to marketspecific risks that could adversely affect investment performance our reputation and our revenues 

several of the price funds and investment portfolios particularly the emerging market and nonus investments are subject to political and economic instability exchangerate fluctuations illiquid and highly volatile markets and other risks that could materially decrease the investment returns available in foreign markets a significant decrease in the investment return or net asset value of any price fund or investment portfolio could harm our reputation and cause a decrease in assets under management including from client asset withdrawals the result could be a material decline in our revenues and net income 

our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse effect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties and litigation 

 8  

  operating risks include 

• failure to properly perform fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities including portfolio accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations required distributions to fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations 

• failure to properly perform transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities including transaction processing tax reporting and record retention and failure to identify excessive trading in mutual funds by our customers or plan participants 

• sales and marketing risks including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of products and services in advertising materials public relations information or other external communications and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

• changes in the level of our advertising expenses including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the united states and further penetrating us distribution channels 

• variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants stock awards changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors 

• a future impairment of the goodwill that is recognized in our balance sheet 

• material fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad 

• expenses and capital costs incurred to enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development 

• unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill and 

• disruptions of thirdparty services such as communications power and mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

under our agreements with our mutual funds we charge our mutual funds certain administrative fees and related expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected 

we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

about 30 of our assets under management are sourced from thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and abroad these intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on third party financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and the related client assets under management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third party intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

• decreasing investment returns on our portfolios 

• causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive 

• inflicting losses in human capital 

• interrupting our business operations 

• triggering technology delays or failures and 

• requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage replace facilities and restore operations 

 9  

  we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose availability of our employees to a significant degree or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to fully maintain our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in our money market stock and bond mutual funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our income from these investments could be adversely affected by a decline in value in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our investment portfolio including the impact of market conditions liquid corporate positions and the size of our longerterm investment portfolio fluctuations in other investment income can be expected to occur in the future 

the investment performance of our savings bank subsidiary could adversely affect our assets and results of operations 

we have a proprietary savings bank subsidiary which accepts deposits from our customers pays a fixed rate of interest to our depositors and invests in fixed income securities although we generally hold our fixed income investments to maturity on a basis which correlates to the maturities of our customer deposits fluctuations in interest rates could result in otherthantemporary impairments among the fixed income investments and could result in a mismatch between the interest rate return on our investment portfolio and the interest paid on our customer deposits to the extent that this occurs our assets and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may elect to pursue growth in the united states and abroad through acquisitions or joint ventures which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations and in expanding into new jurisdictions 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities we cannot assure that we will identify and consummate any such transactions on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy in addition any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping different facilities and technologies and new employees adverse effects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance within a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

we are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations such as the nasd our ability to conduct our business is in large part dictated by such regulation including federal laws such as the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the usa patriot act of 2001 the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa regulations relating to the mutual fund industry specifically and securities laws generally accounting standards and banking and tax laws compliance with these complex regulations and our disclosure and financial reporting obligations requires significant investments of time and money and could limit our ability to enter into new lines of business further the regulations imposed by one jurisdiction may conflict with the regulations imposed by another and these differences may be difficult or impossible to reconcile 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden cause a loss of mutual fund investors and reduce our revenues 

because of trading abuses at several investment management firms regulators have shown increasing interest in the oversight of the mutual fund and investment advisory industry federal agencies have adopted regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry and more rules are expected in the future these new and proposed rules will place greater compliance and administrative burdens on us which could increase our expenses without increasing revenues in addition proposed regulations could require the price funds to reduce the level of certain mutual fund fees paid to us or require us to bear additional expenses which would affect our operating results 

further adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund and investment advisory firms could tarnish the reputation of mutual funds and investment advisers generally causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their balances redemptions would decrease the assets under our management which would reduce our advisory revenues and net income 

 10  

  we may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties there has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims 

we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot assure that our insurance will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available on acceptable terms certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or coinsurance liabilities or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum requirements however a significant operating loss or extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among other functions 

• securities analysis 

• securities trading 

• portfolio management 

• customer service 

• accounting and internal financial processes and controls and 

• regulatory compliance and reporting 

all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism and other causes some of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure a suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology if we are unable to upgrade our technology in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations our systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things 

• seriously damage our reputation 

• allow competitors access to our proprietary business information 

• subject us to liability for a failure to safeguard client data 

• result in the termination of contracts by our existing customers 

• subject us to regulatory action and 

• require significant capital and operating expenditures to investigate and remediate the breach

from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel it is unlikely that pending claims will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

our common stock 20 par value per share trades on the nasdaq stock market under the symbol trow the high and low trade price information rounded to whole cents and dividends per share during the past two years were 

 

there were about 4700 holders of record of our outstanding common stock in january 2007 

we expect to declare and pay cash dividends at the 17 pershare quarterly rate for the first three quarters of 2007 our annual dividends per share have increased every year since we became a public company in 1986 however there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at increasing rates or at all 

our common stockholders have approved all of our equity compensation plans these plans provide for the issuance of up to 65372895 shares of our common stock at december 31 2006 including 43770758 shares that may be issued upon the exercise of outstanding stock options which have a weighted average exercise price of 2597 36000 shares that may be issued upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and 21566137 shares that remain available for future issuance under the terms of the 2004 stock incentive plan the number of shares provided and available for future issuance will increase as we repurchase common stock in the future from the proceeds of stock option exercises

amounts in this item have been adjusted to reflect the twoforone split of our common stock in june 2006 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios investment advisory clients outside the united states account for 7 of our assets under management at december 31 2006 

we manage a broad range of us and international stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

an unsettled environment surrounded the equity markets in the united states during the first seven months of 2006 the positive sentiment evoked by early january indications from the federal reserve that its series of tightening moves was slowing and nearing an end was soon tempered as the fed again raised its target shortterm rate 25 at the end of january it then added three more successive increases of 25 so that the target shortterm rate was 525 at june 30 by the end of july the equity markets were all posting yeartodate losses the trend reversed in early august when the federal reserve discontinued its series of interest rate increases taken together with declines in energy costs and increasing optimism about the us economy a stock market rally ensued continuing through the fourth quarter and into early 2007 the dow jones industrial average was the biggest gainer in 2006 as it passed its january 2000 premarket crash record in october and closed the year up 163 other key indexes also posted strong results for 2006 as the sp 500 gained 136 and the nasdaq was up 95 

the overall positive market environment in the united states was also present around the world in 2006 with the latin america region posting the strongest equity market performance on a broader basis the msci eafe europe australasia and far east index rose 235 during the year 

the yield for 10year us treasuries was 47 at december 31 2006 up from nearly 44 at the start of the year but down from the high of more than 52 in june the yield curve was inverted at yearend 2006 with the sixmonth and twoyear maturities yielding 38 and 11 basis points more respectively than the 10year treasuries the federal reserve target shortterm rate of 525 has remained unchanged since june 2006 

in this financial environment total assets under our management ended 2006 at a record 3347 billion up 24 or 652 billion during the year our strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to investors entrusting a net of 278 billion to our management in 2006 net inflows include 8 billion from the merger of two fund groups into the t rowe price funds and the acquisition of 1 billion of separate account assets higher market valuations and income added 374 billion to our assets under management in 2006 

assets under management at december 31 2006 include 2670 billion in equity and blended asset investment portfolios and 677 billion in fixed income investment portfolios the underlying investment portfolios consist of 2065 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 1282 billion in other investment portfolios that we manage including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 

we expect to increase our expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts may involve significant costs that generally precede the recognition of any future revenues that we may realize from increases to our assets under management 

results of operations 

we split our common stock twoforone in june 2006 and have accordingly restated our pershare results for 2004 and 2005 in the following discussion 

2006 versus 2005  investment advisory revenues were up 22 to 15 billion as a result of a 526 billion increase in average assets under our management to 2997 billion net revenues increased 20 or 3 billion to 18 billion net operating income increased 20 to 787 million from 655 million net income increased 23 to nearly 530 million from 431 million in 2005 diluted earnings per share increased 20 from 158 to 190 

on january 1 2006 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment  and recognized 592 million of noncash stock optionbased compensation expense in 2006 using the fair value based method had we applied the fair value method in 2005 we would have recognized 598 million of additional stock optionbased compensation expense our comparable pro forma diluted earnings for 2005 would then have been 143 per share and our 2006 diluted earnings per share of 190 would be 33 higher than 2005 see our summary of significant accounting policies accompanying our financial statements in item 8 of this report for more information 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 21 or 2 billion to nearly 11 billion average mutual fund assets were 1876 billion in 2006 20 higher than the 2005 average of 1562 billion mutual fund assets ended 2006 at 2065 billion 10 above the 2006 average net inflows to the mutual funds were 129 billion during 2006 including 66 billion that originated in our targetdate retirement funds and 8 billion from the merger of two fund groups into the price funds our us stock and blended asset funds had net inflows of 63 billion while our international stock funds added 28 billion and our bond and money market funds added 38 billion the growth stock fund added 42 billion of net investments this year while the value fund added more than 19 billion higher market valuations and income increased fund assets by 234 billion in 2006 

 14  

  investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 80 million to 415 million average assets in these portfolios were 1121 billion in 2006 up 23 or 212 billion from the 2005 average yearend assets totaled 1282 billion an increase of 14 from the 2006 average and up 289 billion from the start of the year net inflows from us and international investors were 149 billion and market gains and income added 140 billion 

administrative fees and other income increased 29 million to 305 million the change in these revenues includes 52 million from 12b1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares the balance of the increase is primarily attributable to our servicing activities including shareholder accounts and transaction volume in our transfer agent and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors the change in administrative fees is generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that we incur to distribute the advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares through third party financial intermediaries and to provide the noted services to the funds and their investors 

operating expenses were 10 billion in 2006 up 171 million from 2005 our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 136 million or 26 the number of our associates their total compensation and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased the most significant portion of the increase is attributable to the 592 million noncash expense recognized for 2006 stock optionbased compensation the 2006 increase also reflects greater bonus compensation based on our strong operating results for 2006 as well as our strong relative and riskadjusted investment performance our growth in assets under management including new investor inflows and the high quality of our investor services finally we modestly increase our associates’ base salaries at the beginning of each year and have increased our average staff size by 54 versus 2005 primarily to handle increased volumerelated activities and other growth at december 31 2006 we employed 4605 associates 

advertising and promotion expenditures increased 13 or 112 million due to more favorable market conditions and investor interest in 2006 we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in 2007 will be up about 10 versus 2006 and our spending in the first quarter of 2007 to be about the same as the 31 million expended in the fourth quarter of 2006 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 123 million our costs for rented office facilities including increased space and related equipment maintenance and other costs have increased along with our staff size and business needs 

other operating expenses were up 114 million versus 2005 including 52 million of higher distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries that distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares these distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from the 12b1 fees discussed above other operating expenses including travel costs and consulting and information services have risen this year to meet increased business demands 

overall net operating income for 2006 increased 20 to 787 million and the operating margin was 434 up 1 from 2005 

our net nonoperating income which includes interest income as well as the recognition of investment gains and losses and credit facility expenses increased 47 million to 71 million larger money market mutual fund balances during 2006 at higher interest rates added 205 million of the increase the liquidation of our sponsored 2001 collateralized bond obligation in 2006 added 110 million and gains on dispositions of mutual fund investments added 63 million 

the 2006 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 383 up from 366 in 2005 our 2006 income tax provision includes provisions of 6 or 48 million for the anticipated settlement of prior years’ taxes 3 for increased state taxes and 3 for the effect of nondeductible incentive stock optionbased compensation expense that we began recognizing in our 2006 operating results the 2006 provision also does not include the 2 benefit that we recognized in 2005 for the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards we currently estimate that the effective tax rate for the full year 2007 will be about 377 

2005 versus 2004  investment advisory revenues were up 20 or 207 million to more than 12 billion due to the 402 billion increase in average assets under management net revenues increased 235 million to 15 billion net operating income increased nearly 25 to 655 million from 525 million net income increased 94 million to 431 million up 28 from 337 million diluted earnings per share increased 25 from 126 to 158 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 164 million to 900 million average mutual fund assets were 1562 billion during 2005 281 billion or 22 higher than the 1281 billion average during 2004 mutual fund assets ended 2005 at 1702 billion up 247 billion during the year additions to the us mutual funds from the financial intermediary individual direct and defined contribution retirement plan channels were 125 billion basically unchanged from our 2004 experience when 127 billion was added to the funds investors added 97 billion into the us stock funds 21 billion into our international stock funds and 7 billion into our bond and money market funds the growth stock capital appreciation and equity income funds each added more than 1 billion of net investor inflows and together accounted for 65 billion of the funds’ net inflows cash inflows during 2005 also included nearly 400 million resulting from the merger of the td waterhouse index funds into four of the t rowe price index funds higher market valuations and income net of dividends not reinvested added 122 billion to fund assets in 2005 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 425 million to 335 million average assets in these portfolios were 909 billion up 121 billion or 15 from 788 billion in 2004 ending assets in these portfolios were 993 billion up 96 billion from the beginning of 2005 market gains and income added 60 billion while net investor inflows were 36 billion down from 80 billion in 2004 net inflows from subadvised and separate account clients investing in us securities more than offset the net outflows from investors in some of our international investment portfolios

  administrative fees and other income increased 283 million to 276 million the change in these revenues includes 239 million from our servicing activities including shareholder account and transaction volume in our transfer agent and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors additionally revenues increased 44 million from 12b1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares 

operating expenses in 2005 were 1054 million more than in 2004 our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 645 million or 14 from 2004 the number of our associates their total compensation and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased our bonus compensation is based on our operating results for the year which for 2005 reflect our strong relative and riskadjusted investment performance continued growth in assets under management including new investment inflows and sustained highquality investor services base salaries for our associates are increased modestly at the beginning of each year and we increased our average staff size 7 versus 2004 primarily to handle increased volumerelated activities and growth at december 31 2005 we employed 4372 associates up 3 from the 2005 average staffing level 

advertising and promotion expenditures were up 16 or 118 million versus 2004 we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased 103 million our costs for rented office facilities including increased space and related maintenance and operating costs have increased along with our staff size and business needs longerlived buildings and nondepreciable land account for nearly twothirds of the net book value of our property and equipment at december 31 2005 

other operating expenses increased 188 million including 44 million of distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries who distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares these distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from 12b1 fees as discussed above the cost of information services increased 73 million from 2004 primarily because of our decision to pay for nonbrokerdealer thirdparty investment research and related services beginning in 2005 we previously made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain these services other operating expenses also rose in 2005 to include a 2 million increase in charitable contributions to our corporate foundation and to meet increased business demands 

our net nonoperating income which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest income and credit facility expenses increased 159 million to 244 million larger money market and other mutual fund investment balances along with higher interest rates added 122 million to our investment income other net investment gains added 31 million including 18 million realized as a result of the thirdparty acquisition of an entity in which we had invested credit facility costs were down 6 million as we reduced the size and ongoing cost of our credit facility in mid2004 

the 2005 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 366 down from 368 in 2004 due largely to the 14 million reversal of the valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards that is discussed in note 8 to the financial statements 

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2006 stockholders’ equity increased from 20 billion to 24 billion cash and investment holdings are 14 billion at december 31 2006 

operating activities during 2006 provided cash flows of 593 million up 54 million from 2005 including increased net income of 99 million and noncash stockbased compensation expense of 58 million timing differences in the cash settlements of our assets and liabilities reduced comparative cash flows by 107 million net cash used in investing activities totaled 421 million up 330 million from 2005 our investments in mutual funds and other securities made from our larger available cash balances were 272 million more in 2006 than in 2005 capital spending for property and equipment was 94 million in 2006 up 42 million versus 2005 net cash used in financing activities was 203 million in 2006 up 59 million from 2005 we increased our expenditures for common stock repurchases by 95 million and our dividends paid to stockholders by 28 million offsetting these outflows were nearly 66 million of tax benefits realized from option exercises and restricted stock vesting in 2006 

comparatively operating activities provided cash flows of nearly 540 million in 2005 up 165 million versus 2004 net income accounted for nearly 94 million of the increase while timing differences in the cash settlements of our assets and liabilities added 66 million net cash used in investing activities totaled nearly 92 million up 16 million from 2004 capital spending for property and equipment was 52 million in 2005 up 9 million from 2004 levels our mutual fund net investments were 37 million in 2005 an increase of 5 million from 2004 net cash used in financing activities totaled 144 million in 2005 up 109 million from 2004 we expended 76 million in 2005 to repurchase 13 million shares of our common stock compared to 18 million for 400000 shares in 2004 we also distributed 23 million more to our stockholders in 2005 based on our larger pershare quarterly dividend and collected 27 million less from option exercises that at a lower rate in 2005 resulted in 18 million fewer shares being issued versus in 2004 

property and equipment expenditures in 2007 including those for the buildout of our expanded corporate and other business facilities are anticipated to be about 170 million and are expected to be funded from cash balances 

contractual obligations 

the following table in millions presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2006 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2007 and future years 

 16  

   

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional equity investments totaling 197 million at december 31 2006 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to consolidated financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements significant accounting policies and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2006 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

other than temporary impairments of availableforsale securities  we classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as availableforsale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

an impaired debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our statement of income whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security a determination of this type is based on the issuer’s financial condition and our ability and intent to hold the investment until its fair value recovers which may mean until maturity and to collect all contractual cash flows minor impairments of 5 or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary 

goodwill  we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business 

our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds our carrying amount basically our stockholders’ equity and therefore that no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet 6657 million 

stock options  on january 1 2006 we adopted the provisions of sfas 123r and began recognizing stock optionbased compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income using the fair value based method prior to 2006 our stock option grants were accounted for using the intrinsic value based method and no compensation expense related to our option grants was recognized in our consolidated statements of income the summary of significant accounting policies accompanying our consolidated financial statements includes certain pro forma disclosures for 2004 and 2005 as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants 

fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration the blackscholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

 17  

  provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in several states and several countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns that represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from time to time we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as our estimates change and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any prior year adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

on january 1 2007 we will adopt the provisions of recently issued fasb interpretation 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  in regards to our accounting for and disclosure of uncertain tax positions we have reviewed our accounting for income taxes in light of the provisions of fin 48 and do not expect that adoption will materially affect our consolidated financial statements 

forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a of this form 10k annual report under the caption risk factors further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends relative to participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants stock awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management accordingly declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income 

 18  

  we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

the following table in millions presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund’s lowest fair value per share during 2006 in considering this presentation it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

 

the comparable potential loss of value presented in our 2005 annual report was 288 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 2642 million at december 31 2005 during 2006 we actually experienced net unrealized gains of 380 million 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as management deems appropriate 

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 

we also hold other investments of 818 million at december 31 2006 that we are at risk for loss up to our carrying amount should market conditions deteriorate us treasury holdings generally considered to be of the lowest risk profile account for 556 million of these investments 

we operate in several foreign countries most prominent among which is great britain we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenue stream is predominately realized in us dollar receipts we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially affect our results of operations

 item 1 business 

t rowe price group is a financial services holding company that derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

we operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies primarily t rowe price associates t rowe price international and t rowe price global investment services the late thomas rowe price jr began our advisory business in 1937 and the common stock of t rowe price associates was first offered to the public in 1986 the t rowe price group corporate holding company structure was established in late 2000 

total assets under our management increased 343 billion over the course of 2005 and ended the year at an alltime record of 2695 billion including 178 billion held in retirement accounts and variable annuity investment portfolios assets under our management at the end of 2005 included 2083 billion of equity securities and 612 billion of debt securities the five largest price funds at december 31 2005 — equity income midcap growth growth stock blue chip growth and smallcap stock — account for 24 of assets under management at that time and nearly 30 of 2005 investment advisory revenues 

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base that is accessed across four primary distribution methods our assets under management are sourced approximately 2030 from each of the following thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and foreign countries individual us investors on a direct basis us defined contribution retirement plans and institutional investors in the us and foreign countries our largest client account relationship excluding the t rowe price funds is with a thirdparty financial intermediary that accounted for 4 of our investment advisory revenues in 2005 

in 2001 our uk investment advisory subsidiary t rowe price global investment services expanded our investment advisory business to europe where we now offer separate account management to institutional investors subadvisory services and a series of luxembourgdomiciled mutual funds with share classes for institutional investors and for individuals reached through third party intermediaries these initiatives complement those that we began in 1999 in japan through which we subadvise investment assets for daiwa sb investments we hold a 10 interest in daiwa sb our international clients account for 5 of our total assets under management at december 31 2005 

we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors for example mutual fund shareholders can exchange balances among mutual funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change 

from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund if we believe that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund in order to maintain the integrity of the fund’s investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders at present the following funds are closed to new investors 

 

these funds continue to attract considerable net cash inflows from existing fund shareholders and direct rollovers from retirement plans into new ira accounts that we offer 

  investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus investment management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global or international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity investment strategies as well as active systematic and municipal taxfree management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities received from thirdparty venture capital investment pools 

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the united states and great britain with additional staff resident in argentina hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market and security analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling 

prior to 2005 we made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain nonbrokerdealer thirdparty investment research and related services after careful evaluation during 2004 we decided to phase out these arrangements and to pay for these services directly 

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds discount brokerage and trust services about 90 of our administrative revenues in 2005 were based on the recovery of expenses incurred to provide the related services administrative revenues therefore do not significantly affect our net income 

information concerning our revenues results of operations total assets and investment assets under our management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial statements and in note 5 thereto which are both included in item 8 of this form 10k 

2005 developments 

financial market results in the united states during 2005 were mixed with the three major stock market indexes falling below end of 2004 levels for much of the year there were periods of strength however as all three indexes reached fouryear highs before falling back late in the year investor concerns about rising interest rates and record high fuel prices were compounded by the hurricane damage to the gulf coast region of the united states military action terrorism and the uncertainties surrounding the strength of the us economy also continued to weigh on the financial markets the sp 500 closed 2005 with the best performance among the indexes posting a modest 3 return for the year the nasdaq index which is heavily weighted with technology companies ended the year up only 14 while the dow jones industrials closed down 6 for the year 

foreign equity markets were stronger in 2005 with the dow jones latin america asiapacific and europe indexes all outperforming their us counterparts lower global interest rates higher corporate profits and stronger economic conditions including those in emerging markets broadly presented favorable conditions for the financial markets outside the united states 

as for fixed income securities yields for 10year us treasuries rose only 4 to close 2005 at 439 by yearend the yield curve had inverted with shortterm rates exceeding longterm rates and investors worried about the possibility of a pending economic downturn the federal reserve continued its series of 25 increases in 2005 pushing the target shortterm rate up 200 basis points over the course of the year to 425 as 2006 began the federal reserve signaled that its series of tightening moves was slowing and nearing an end 

  despite this less than robust financial environment in 2005 total assets under our management ended 2005 at a record 2695 billion up 343 billion during the year strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to investors entrusting 161 billion of net cash inflows to our management in 2005 down from the 207 billion record net cash inflows in 2004 net cash inflows during 2005 included nearly 400 million resulting from the july merger of the td waterhouse index funds into four of the t rowe price index funds higher market valuations and income increased assets under our management by 182 billion during 2005 

assets under management at december 31 2005 include 1702 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 993 billion in other investment portfolios that we manage including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 

in particular the investment advisory results for the t rowe price funds have been strong at least 70 of the funds across their share classes surpassed their lipper peer group averages on a total return basis for the one three five and 10year periods ended december 31 2005 in addition 59 of our rated mutual funds in the us ended the year with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar compared with 325 for the overall industry 

our series of target date retirement funds which are designed to provide shareholders with single diversified portfolios that invest in underlying t rowe price funds and automatically shift asset allocations between funds as the investor ages continue to be a significant part of asset growth total assets in the retirement funds reached 84 billion at december 31 2005 an increase of 48 billion over the course of 2005 

price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve material changes to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

advisory services investment advisory revenues are based upon the daily net assets managed in each fund additional fees are earned for advisoryrelated administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures 

the advisory fee paid by each of the price funds generally is computed each day by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee for the majority of the price funds the fee is equal to the sum of a group charge that is set based on the combined net assets of those funds and an individual fund charge that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective the 2005 fee rates determined in this manner varied from a low of 31 basis points for the us treasury money to a high of 106 basis points for the emerging markets stock emerging europe  mediterranean international discovery and latin america funds to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of the fee and each overall fund fee decreases details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus 

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios 

certain of the t rowe price mutual funds also offer an advisor andor r class of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the t rowe price mutual fund shares we recognize 12b1 fee revenue on these classes of fund shares pursuant to the funds’ 12b1 plans payment of the fee is made to each intermediary pursuant to the 12b1 plans and each intermediary’s agreement with t rowe price investment services 

  in accounting for the 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding administrative revenue in our consolidated statement of income we also recognize the corresponding expense for the payments to each thirdparty financial intermediary in our consolidated statement of income as part of other operating expenses the revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third party intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income 

we do not receive any 12b1 fees on the primary investor class of t rowe price mutual fund shares 

we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles 

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses 

several of the price funds have different fee arrangements the equity market index funds and the summit funds each have single allinclusive fees covering all investment management and operating expenses each of the funds in the spectrum series and the retirement date series of mutual funds invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest mutual funds for institutional investors each have separate advisory fee arrangements 

we usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period we absorb all advisory fees and other mutual fund expenses in excess of these selfimposed limits 

except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds these costs are recognized currently and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing and promotional efforts are focused in the print media television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest market conditions new investment offerings and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives including those arising from international expansion and enhancements to our web site 

administrative services we provide advisoryrelated administrative services to the price funds through our subsidiaries t rowe price services provides mutual fund transfer agency and shareholder services including maintenance of staff facilities and technology and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders t rowe price associates provides mutual fund accounting services including maintenance of financial records preparation of financial statements and reports daily valuation of portfolio securities and computation of daily net asset values per share t rowe price retirement plan services provides participant accounting plan administration and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the price funds plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some services while the price funds compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the funds 

our trustee services are provided by another subsidiary t rowe price trust company through this marylandchartered limitedservice trust company we offer common trust funds for investment by qualified retirement plans and serve as trustee for retirement plans and iras t rowe price trust company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans another subsidiary t rowe price savings bank issues federally insured certificates of deposit 

we also provide investment advisory services to shareholders and potential investors in the price funds through our subsidiary t rowe price advisory services these services currently include an investment checkup of an individual’s financial situation the retirement income manager for developing an individual’s personal income and investment strategy during retirement and a rollover investment service for investing retirement plan distributions 

fund assets at december 31 2005 assets under our management in the price funds aggregated 1702 billion an increase of nearly 25 billion from the beginning of the year the following table presents the net assets in millions of our largest funds net assets in excess of 250 million at december 31 2004 and 2005 and the year each fund was started the spectrum and retirement series of funds are not listed in the table because their assets are included in the underlying funds 

   

we invest in many of the t rowe price funds through our operating subsidiaries and our investments holding company subsidiary trp finance 

  other investment portfolios we managed 993 billion at december 31 2005 in other client investment portfolios up 96 billion from the beginning of the year we provide investment advisory services to these clients through our subsidiaries on a separately managed or subadvised account basis and through sponsored investment portfolios generally organized by us such as common trust funds partnerships the luxembourgbased mutual funds and variable annuity life insurance plans at december 31 these portfolios included the following investment assets 

 

our fees for managing these investment portfolios are computed using the value of assets under our management in 2005 more than 60 of these advisory fees were recognized based on daily valuations the balance of these managed investment portfolios are generally billed quarterly end of billing period valuations generated about 30 of the 2005 advisory fees from other managed portfolios while beginning of billing period values were the basis for less than 10 of these fees 

we charge fees for investment management based on among other things the specific investment services to be provided our standard form of investment advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be refunded

all aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations these laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and the price funds’ shareholders they generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to comply with laws and regulations possible sanctions that may be imposed on us in the event that we fail to comply include the suspension of individual employees limitations on engaging in certain business activities for specified periods of time revocation of our investment adviser and other registrations censures and fines 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements including those of various federal state and foreign regulatory agencies our subsidiaries’ net capital as defined meets or exceeds all minimum requirements 

competition as a member of the financial services industry we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business a significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms brokerdealers mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance companies banks and other financial institutions in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do we compete with other providers of investment management services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and quality of our services 

we believe that competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and if appropriate engage in discussions or negotiations that could lead to acquisitions or new financial relationships 

  employees at december 31 2005 we employed 4372 associates up 56 from the end of 2004 we may add additional temporary and parttime personnel to our staff from time to time to meet periodic and special project demands primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative services

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

an investment in our common stock involves various risks including those mentioned below and those that are discussed from timetotime in our other periodic filings with the sec investors should carefully consider these risks along with the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision regarding our common stock there may be additional risks of which we are currently unaware or which we currently consider immaterial all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and value of our common stock 

risks relating to our business and the financial services industry 

our revenues are based on the market value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to fluctuation caused by factors outside of our control 

we derive our revenues primarily from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries to individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds and other investment portfolios our investment advisory fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the market value of the assets under our management we generally earn higher fees on assets invested in our equity funds and equity investment portfolios than we earn on assets invested in our fixed income funds and portfolios among equity investments there is a significant variation in fees earned from indexbased investments at the low end and emerging markets funds and portfolios at the high end fees also vary across the fixed income funds and portfolios though not as widely as equity investments with money market securities at the low end and nonus bonds at the high end as a result our revenues are dependent on the value and composition of the assets under our management all of which are subject to substantial fluctuation due to many factors including 

• investor mobility our investors generally may withdraw their funds at any time on very short notice and without any significant penalty 

• general market declines a general downturn in stock or bond prices would cause the value of assets under our management to decrease and may also cause investors to withdraw their investments thereby further decreasing the level of assets under our management 

• investment performance if the investment performance of our managed portfolios is less than that of our competitors or applicable thirdparty benchmarks we could lose existing and potential customers and suffer a decrease in assets under management institutional investors in particular consider changing investment advisors based upon poor relative investment performance individual investors in contrast are more likely to react to poor absolute investment performance 

• global economies national and international political and economic events may cause financial market declines that lower the value of assets under our management and may cause investors to withdraw funds 

• investing trends changes in investing trends and in particular retirement savings trends may reduce interest in our funds and portfolios and may alter our mix of assets 

• interest rate changes investor interest in and the valuation of our fixed income investment funds and portfolios are affected by changes in interest rates 

• tax regulation changes changes in the status of tax deferred retirement plan investments and taxfree municipal bonds the capital gains and corporate dividend tax rates and other individual and corporate tax rates and regulations could adversely affect investor behavior and may cause investors to view certain investment offerings less favorably and withdraw their investment assets thereby decreasing the level of assets under our management 

a decrease in the value of assets under our management or adverse change in their composition could have a material adverse effect on our investment advisory fees and revenues for any period in which revenues decline net income and operating margins will likely decline by a greater proportion because certain expenses will be fixed over that finite period 

  a significant majority of our revenues are based on contracts with the price funds that are subject to termination without cause and on short notice 

we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each price fund under individual investment management agreements the board of each price fund must annually approve the terms of the investment management and service agreements and can terminate the agreement upon 60day notice if a price fund seeks to lower the fees that we receive or terminate its contract with us we would experience a decline in fees earned from the price funds which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

we operate in an intensely competitive industry which could cause a loss of customers and their assets thereby reducing our assets under management and our revenues and net income 

we are subject to competition in all aspects of our business from 

• asset management firms • mutual fund companies • commercial banks and thrift institutions • insurance companies • hedge funds • exchange traded funds • brokerage and investment banking firms and • other financial institutions including multinational firms and subsidiaries of diversified conglomerates 

many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do and may offer a broader range of products or operate in more markets some operate in a different regulatory environment than we do which may give them certain competitive advantages in the investment products and portfolio structures that they offer we compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment portfolios offered our investment performance and the scope and quality of our investment advice and other client services some institutions have proprietary products and distribution channels that make it more difficult for us to compete with them we believe that competition within the investment management industry will increase as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity and because new competitors face few barriers to entry most of our investment portfolios are available without sales or redemption fees which means that investors may be more willing to transfer assets to competing funds 

if current or potential customers decide to use one of our competitors we could face a significant decline in market share assets under management revenues and net income if we are required to lower our fees in order to remain competitive our net income could be significantly reduced because some of our expenses are fixed especially over shorter periods of time and others may not decrease in proportion to the decrease in revenues 

our success depends on our key personnel and our financial performance could be negatively affected by the loss of their services 

our success depends on our highly skilled personnel including our portfolio and fund managers investment analysts management and client relationship personnel and corporate officers many of whom have specialized expertise and extensive experience in our industry financial services professionals are in high demand and we face significant competition for qualified employees our key employees do not have employment contracts and generally can terminate their employment with us at any time we cannot assure that we will be able to retain or replace key personnel in order to retain or replace our key personnel we may be required to increase compensation which would decrease net income the loss of key personnel could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to retain and attract new employees and investors losses of assets from our client investors would decrease our revenues and net income possibly materially 

certain of the price funds and other investment portfolios are vulnerable to marketspecific risks that could adversely affect investment performance our reputation and our revenues 

several of the price funds and investment portfolios particularly the emerging market and nonus investments are subject to political and economic instability exchangerate fluctuations illiquid and highly volatile markets and other risks that could materially decrease the investment returns available in foreign markets a significant decrease in the investment return or net asset value of any price fund or investment portfolio could harm our reputation and cause a decrease in assets under management including from client asset withdrawals the result could be a material decline in our revenues and net income 

  our operations are complex and a failure to perform operational tasks or the misrepresentation of products and services could have an adverse affect on our reputation and subject us to regulatory sanctions fines penalties and litigation 

operating risks include 

• failure to properly perform fund or portfolio recordkeeping responsibilities including portfolio accounting security pricing corporate actions investment restrictions compliance daily net asset value computations account reconciliations required distributions to fund shareholders to comply with tax regulations 

• failure to properly perform transfer agent and participant recordkeeping responsibilities including transaction processing tax reporting and record retention and failure to identify excessive trading in mutual funds by our customers or plan participants 

• sales and marketing risks including the intentional or unintentional misrepresentation of products and services in advertising materials public relations information or other external communications and failure to properly calculate and present investment performance data accurately and in accordance with established guidelines and regulations 

any damage to our reputation could harm our business and lead to a loss of revenues and net income 

we have spent many years developing our reputation for integrity strong investment performance and superior client services our brand is a valuable intangible asset but it is vulnerable to a variety of threats that can be difficult or impossible to control and costly or even impossible to remediate regulatory inquiries and rumors can tarnish or substantially damage our reputation even if they are satisfactorily addressed any damage to our brand could impede our ability to attract and retain customers and key personnel and reduce the amount of assets under our management any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net income 

our expenses are subject to significant fluctuations that could materially decrease net income 

our operating results are dependent on the level of our expenses which can vary significantly for many reasons including 

• changes in the level of our advertising expenses including the costs of expanding investment advisory services to investors outside of the united states and further penetrating us distribution channels 

• variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants stock awards changes in employee benefit costs due to regulatory or plan design changes changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors 

• a future impairment of goodwill recognized in our balance sheet 

• material fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our operations abroad 

• expenses and capital costs incurred to enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development 

• unanticipated costs incurred to protect investor accounts and client goodwill and 

• disruptions of thirdparty services such as communications power and mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

under our agreements with our mutual funds we charge our mutual funds certain administrative and other expenses based upon contracted terms if we fail to accurately estimate our underlying expense levels or otherwise are required to incur expenses relating to the mutual funds that are not paid by the funds our operating results will be adversely affected 

  we have contracted with thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our investment portfolios and such relationships may not be available or profitable to us in the future 

about 30 of our assets under management are sourced from thirdparty financial intermediaries that distribute our managed investment portfolios in the us and abroad these intermediaries generally offer their clients various investment products in addition to and in competition with our investment offerings and have no contractual obligation to encourage investment in our portfolios it would be difficult for us to acquire or retain the management of those assets without the assistance of the intermediaries and we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain an adequate number of successful distribution relationships in addition some investors rely on third party financial planners registered investment advisers and other consultants or financial professionals to advise them on the choice of investment adviser and investment portfolio these professionals and consultants can favor a competing investment portfolio as better meeting their particular client’s needs we cannot assure that our investment offerings will be among their recommended choices in the future further their recommendations can change over time and we could lose their recommendation and the related client assets under management mergers acquisitions and other ownership or management changes could also adversely impact our relationships with these third party intermediaries the presence of any of the adverse conditions discussed above would reduce revenues and net income possibly by material amounts 

natural disasters and other unpredictable events could adversely affect our operations 

armed conflict terrorist attacks power failures and natural disasters could adversely affect our revenues expenses and net income by 

• decreasing investment returns on our portfolios • causing disruptions in national or global economies that decrease investor confidence and make investment products generally less attractive • inflicting losses in human capital • interrupting our business operations • triggering technology delays or failures and • requiring substantial capital expenditures and operating expenses to remediate damage replace facilities and restore operations 

we have developed various backup systems and contingency plans to deal with these possible events but we cannot be assured that they will be adequate in all circumstances that could arise or that material interruptions and disruptions will not occur in addition we rely to varying degrees on outside vendors for disaster contingency support and we cannot be assured that these vendors will be able to perform in an adequate and timely manner if we lose any employees or if we are unable to respond adequately to such an event in a timely manner we may be unable to continue our business operations which could lead to a tarnished reputation and loss of customers that results in a decrease in assets under management lower revenues and materially reduced net income 

our investment income and asset levels may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in our investment portfolio 

we currently have a substantial portion of our assets invested in our money market stock and bond mutual funds all of these investments are subject to investment market risk and our income from these investments could be adversely affected by a decline in value in addition related investment income has fluctuated significantly over the years depending upon the performance of our investment portfolio including the impact of market conditions liquid corporate positions and the size of our longerterm investment portfolio fluctuations in other investment income can be expected to occur in the future 

the investment performance of our savings bank subsidiary could adversely affect our assets and results of operations 

we have a propriety savings bank subsidiary which accepts deposits from our customers pays a fixed rate of interest to our depositors and invests in fixed income securities although we generally hold our fixed income investments to maturity on a basis which correlates to the maturities of our customer deposits fluctuations in interest rates could result in losses in these fixed income investments and could result in a mismatch between the interest rate return on our investment portfolio and the interest paid on our customer deposits to the extent that this occurs our assets and results of operations could be adversely affected 

  we may elect to pursue growth in the united states and abroad through acquisitions or joint ventures which exposes us to risks inherent in assimilating new operations and in expanding into new jurisdictions 

in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review and pursue acquisition and venture opportunities we cannot assure that we will identify and consummate any such transactions on acceptable terms or have sufficient resources to accomplish such a strategy in addition any strategic transaction can involve a number of risks including additional demands on our staff unanticipated problems regarding integration of investor account and investment security recordkeeping different facilities and technologies and new employees adverse affects in the event acquired intangible assets or goodwill become impaired and the existence of liabilities or contingencies not disclosed to or otherwise known by us prior to closing a transaction 

legal and regulatory risks 

compliance with a complex regulatory environment imposes significant financial and strategic costs on our business and noncompliance could result in fines and penalties 

we are subject to extensive regulation by foreign and domestic governments regulatory agencies such as the sec in the united states and the fsa in united kingdom and selfregulatory organizations such as the nasd our ability to conduct our business is in large part dictated by such regulation including federal laws such as the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 the usa patriot act of 2001 the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa regulations relating to the mutual fund industry specifically and securities laws generally accounting rules and banking and tax laws compliance with these complex regulations and our disclosure and financial reporting obligations requires significant investments of time and money and could limit our ability to enter into new lines of business further the regulations imposed by one jurisdiction may conflict with the regulations imposed by another and these differences may be difficult or impossible to reconcile 

our regulatory environment is frequently altered by new regulations and by revisions to and evolving interpretations of existing regulations future changes could require us to modify or curtail our investment offerings and business operations 

if we are unable to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to criminal and civil liability the suspension of our employees fines penalties sanctions injunctive relief exclusion from certain markets or temporary or permanent loss of licenses or registrations necessary to conduct our business a regulatory proceeding even if it does not result in a finding of wrongdoing or sanctions could consume substantial expenditures of time and capital any regulatory investigation and any failure to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations could severely damage our reputation adversely affect our ability to conduct business and decrease revenue and net income 

legal and regulatory developments in the mutual fund and investment advisory industry could increase our regulatory burden cause a loss of mutual fund investors and reduce our revenues 

because of trading abuses at several investment management firms regulators have shown increasing interest in the oversight of the mutual fund and investment advisory industry federal agencies have adopted regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry and more rules are expected in the future these new and proposed rules will place greater compliance and administrative burdens on us which could increase our expenses without increasing revenues in addition proposed regulations could require the price funds to reduce the level of certain mutual fund fees paid to us or require us to bear additional expenses which would affect our operating results further adverse results of regulatory investigations of mutual fund and investment advisory firms could tarnish the reputation of mutual funds and investment advisers generally causing investors to avoid further fund investments or redeem their balances redemptions would decrease the assets under our management which would reduce our advisory revenues and net income 

we may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that may not be covered by insurance 

we are subject to regulatory and governmental inquiries and civil litigation an adverse outcome of any such proceeding could involve substantial financial penalties there has been increased incidence of litigation and regulatory investigations in the financial services industry in recent years including customer claims and class action suits alleging substantial monetary damages from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims 

  we carry insurance in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate we cannot assure that our insurance will cover all liabilities and losses to which we may be exposed or that our insurance policies will continue to be available on acceptable terms certain insurance coverage may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive in future periods as our insurance policies come up for renewal we may need to assume higher deductibles or other coinsurance liability or pay higher premiums which would increase our expenses and reduce our net income 

net capital requirements may impede the business operations of our subsidiaries 

certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements imposed by various federal state and foreign authorities our subsidiaries’ net capital meets or exceeds all minimum requirements however a significant operating loss or extraordinary charge against net capital could adversely affect the ability of our subsidiaries to expand or even maintain their operations if we were unable to make additional investments in them 

technology risks 

we require specialized technology to operate our business and would be adversely affected if our technology became inoperative or obsolete 

we depend on highly specialized and in many cases proprietary technology to support our business functions including among other functions 

 

all of our technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking viruses natural disasters power failures acts of war or terrorism and other causes some of our software is licensed from and supported by outside vendors upon whom we rely to prevent operating system failure a suspension or termination of these licenses or the related support upgrades and maintenance could cause system delays or interruption if our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way we would be unable to fulfill critical business functions which could lead to a loss of customers and could harm our reputation technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our customers 

in addition our continued success depends on our ability to effectively integrate operations across many countries and to adopt new or adapt existing technologies to meet client industry and regulatory demands we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology if we are unable to upgrade our technology in a timely fashion we might lose customers and fail to maintain regulatory compliance which could affect our results of operations and severely damage our reputation 

we could be subject to losses if we fail to properly safeguard sensitive and confidential information 

as part of our normal operations we maintain and transmit confidential information about our clients as well as proprietary information relating to our business operations our systems could be victimized by unauthorized users or corrupted by computer viruses or other malicious software code or authorized persons could inadvertently or intentionally release confidential or proprietary information such disclosure could among other things

in september 2003 a purported class action tk parthasarathy et al including woodbury v t rowe price international funds inc et al was filed in the circuit court third judicial circuit madison county illinois against t rowe price international and the t rowe price international funds with respect to the t rowe price international stock fund the basic allegations in the case were that the t rowe price defendants did not make appropriate value adjustments to the foreign securities owned by the t rowe price international stock fund prior to calculating the fund’s daily share prices thereby allegedly enabling market timing traders to trade the fund’s shares in such a way as to disadvantage longterm investors the plaintiffs sought monetary damages the case was removed on april 22 2005 to the us district court for the southern district of illinois which dismissed the case on may 27 2005 the plaintiff appealed to the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit the appeal was stayed pending the outcome of a petition for certiorari to the supreme court in a related case that petition has now been granted but the court of appeals has not indicated whether it will now decide this case or await further developments in the related case 

from time to time various claims against us arise in the ordinary course of business including employmentrelated claims in the opinion of management after consultation with counsel it is unlikely that any adverse determination in one or more pending claims would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

general 

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios investment advisory clients outside the united states account for 5 of our assets under management at december 31 2005 

we manage a broad range of us and international stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations 

financial market results in the united states during 2005 were mixed with the three major stock market indexes falling below end of 2004 levels for much of the year there were periods of strength however as all three indexes reached fouryear highs before falling back late in the year investor concerns about rising interest rates and record high fuel prices were compounded by the hurricane damage to the gulf coast region of the united states military action terrorism and the uncertainties surrounding the strength of the us economy also continued to weigh on the financial markets the sp 500 closed 2005 with the best performance among the indexes posting a modest 3 return for the year the nasdaq index which is heavily weighted with technology companies ended the year up only 14 while the dow jones industrials closed down 6 for the year 

foreign equity markets were stronger in 2005 with the dow jones latin america asiapacific and europe indexes all outperforming their us counterparts lower global interest rates higher corporate profits and stronger economic conditions including those in emerging markets broadly presented favorable conditions for the financial markets outside the united states 

as for fixed income securities yields for 10year us treasuries rose only 4 to close 2005 at 439 by yearend the yield curve had inverted with shortterm rates exceeding longterm rates and investors worried about the possibility of a pending economic downturn the federal reserve continued its series of 25 increases in 2005 pushing the target shortterm rate up 200 basis points over the course of the year to 425 as 2006 began the federal reserve signaled that its series of tightening moves was slowing and nearing an end 

despite this less than robust financial environment in 2005 total assets under our management ended 2005 at a record 2695 billion up 343 billion during the year strong relative investment performance and brand awareness contributed significantly to investors entrusting 161 billion of net cash inflows to our management in 2005 down from the 207 billion record net cash inflows in 2004 higher market valuations and income increased assets under our management by 182 billion during 2005 

assets under management at december 31 2005 include 2083 billion in equity securities and 612 billion in bond and money market holdings the underlying investment portfolios consist of 1702 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 993 billion in other investment portfolios that we manage including separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment funds offered to investors outside the us and through variable annuity life insurance plans 

in an improving market environment for 2006 we would expect to increase our expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts may involve significant costs that precede the recognition of any future revenues that we may realize from increases to our assets under management 

results of operations 

2005 versus 2004 investment advisory revenues were up 20 or nearly 207 million to more than 12 billion due to the 402 billion increase in average assets under management net revenues increased 235 million to 15 billion net operating income increased nearly 25 to 655 million from 525 million net income increased nearly 94 million to almost 431 million up 28 from 337 million diluted earnings per share increased 255 from 251 to 315

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 424 million to 335 million average assets in these portfolios were 909 billion up 121 billion or 15 from 788 billion in 2004 ending assets in these portfolios were 993 billion up 96 billion from the beginning of 2005 market gains and income added 60 billion while net investor inflows were 36 billion down from 80 billion in 2004 net inflows from subadvised and separate account clients investing in us securities more than offset the net outflows from investors in some of our international investment portfolios 

administrative fees and other income increased 283 million to 276 million the change in these revenues includes 239 million from our servicing activities including shareholder account and transaction volume in our transfer agent and defined contribution plan recordkeeping services for the mutual funds and their investors additionally revenues increased 44 million from 12b1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares these changes in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that we incur to provide these services and distribute the advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares through third party financial intermediaries 

operating expenses in 2005 were 1054 million more than in 2004 our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 645 million or 14 from 2004 the number of our associates their total compensation and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased our bonus compensation is based on our operating results for the year which for 2005 reflect our strong relative and riskadjusted investment performance continued growth in assets under management including new investment inflows and sustained highquality investor services base salaries for our associates are increased modestly at the beginning of each year and we increased our average staff size 7 versus 2004 primarily to handle increased volumerelated activities and growth at december 31 2005 we employed 4372 associates up 3 from the 2005 average staffing level 

advertising and promotion expenditures were up 16 or 119 million versus 2004 we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first quarter of 2006 will be up about 3 million versus the comparable 2005 first quarter while market conditions will dictate the exact level of our spending we expect that our advertising and promotion expenditures for 2006 will be 5 to 10 higher than in 2005 we vary our level of spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 

occupancy and facility costs together with depreciation expense increased more than 102 million our costs for rented office facilities including increased space and related maintenance and operating costs have increased along with our staff size and business needs longerlived buildings and nondepreciable land account for nearly twothirds of the net book value of our property and equipment at december 31 2005 

other operating expenses increased 188 million including 44 million of distribution expenses recognized on greater assets under management sourced from financial intermediaries who distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares these distribution costs are offset by an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from 12b1 fees as discussed above the cost of information services increased 73 million from 2004 primarily because of our decision to pay for nonbrokerdealer thirdparty investment research and related services beginning in 2005 we previously made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain these services other operating expenses also rose in 2005 to include a 2 million increase in charitable contributions to our corporate foundation and to meet increased business demands 

  our net nonoperating income which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest income and credit facility expenses increased 159 million to 244 million larger money market and other mutual fund investment balances along with higher interest rates added 122 million to our investment income other net investment gains added 31 million including 18 million realized as a result of the thirdparty acquisition of an entity in which we had invested credit facility costs were down 6 million as we reduced the size and ongoing cost of our credit facility in mid2004 

the 2005 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 366 down from 368 in 2004 due largely to the 14 million reversal of the valuation allowance for foreign net operating loss carryforwards that is discussed in note 3 to the financial statements we currently expect our effective tax rate to rise to 372 in 2006 with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123r sharebased payment sfas 123r 

2004 versus 2003 both net revenues and total revenues increased more than 281 million to nearly 13 billion net operating income increased 160 million to 525 million from 365 million net income increased about 110 million to 337 million up more than 48 from 2275 million in 2003 diluted earnings per share increased nearly 42 from 177 to 251 

investment advisory revenues were up 32 or 251 million in 2004 compared to 2003 increased assets under management drove the change as average mutual fund assets were more than 128 billion almost 29 billion higher than the 994 billion average in 2003 average assets in other managed portfolios were almost 79 billion in 2004 up more than 18 billion versus the average of 605 billion in 2003 total average assets under management increased 470 billion during 2004 to end the year at nearly 207 million 

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 178 million mutual fund assets ended 2004 at 1455 billion up 28 billion from the beginning of the year market appreciation and income net of dividends paid and not reinvested added 153 billion to mutual fund assets during 2004 and net investor inflows added another 127 billion net cash flows during 2004 were supported broadly by the financial intermediary individual direct and defined contribution retirement plan channels and were concentrated in the us domestic stock mutual funds the midcap value equity income growth stock capital appreciation and midcap growth funds each added more than 1 billion of net investor inflows and together accounted for 95 billion of the funds’ net inflows in 2004 bond and money market funds added 1 billion of net investor flows while the international stock funds had net outflows of less than 500 million 

investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased more than 73 million to almost 293 million in 2004 ending assets in these portfolios were 897 billion up 172 billion since the beginning of the year net inflows to these portfolios were 8 billion while market appreciation and income added 92 billion in 2004 investment activity through financial intermediaries in the united states japan and europe and new institutional investors including assignments from europe and australia were responsible for these new investment dollars

advertising and promotion expenditures during 2004 were up 15 million compared to 2003 we vary our promotional spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 5 million in 2004 offsetting the increase of 39 million in other occupancy and facility costslongerlived buildings and nondepreciable land account for twothirds of the net book value of our property and equipment at december 31 2004 costs of rented facilities and related operating costs were higher in 2004 

  other operating expenses in 2004 increased 324 million including 75 million paid based on greater assets under management that are sourced through financial intermediaries that distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares these costs are funded from an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from 12b1 fees as discussed above for 2004 we increased our charitable contribution to our corporate foundation by 6 million other operating expenses this year have risen to meet increased business demands they include among other things travel costs information services and professional fees for legal audit and consulting services and regulatory compliance 

overall net operating income for 2004 increased 160 million or 44 from 2003

the 2004 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 368 for 2004 down 1 from 2003 greater taxexempt and nontaxable dividend income use of foreign net operating loss carryforwards and settlements of prior year taxes at lower rates all contributed to this lower rate 

capital resources and liquidity 

during 2005 stockholders’ equity increased from 17 billion to 20 billion available liquid assets including our mutual fund investments exceed 1 billion at december 31 2005 a 300 million undrawn committed credit facility expiring in june 2007 is also available to the company 

operating activities provided cash flows of 539 million in 2005 up 165 million versus 2004 net income accounted for nearly 94 million of the increase while timing differences in the cash settlements of our assets and liabilities added 66 million net cash used in investing activities totaled nearly 92 million up 16 million from 2004 capital spending for property and equipment was 52 million in 2005 up nearly 9 million from 2004 levels our mutual fund net investments were 37 million in 2005 an increase of 5 million from 2004 net cash used in financing activities totaled 144 million in 2005 up 109 million from 2004 we expended 76 million in 2005 to repurchase 13 million shares of our common stock compared to 18 million for 400000 shares in 2004 we also distributed 23 million more to our stockholders in 2005 based on our larger pershare quarterly dividend and collected 27 million less from option exercises that at a lower rate in 2005 resulted in 18 million fewer shares being issued versus in 2004

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional equity investments totaling 67 million at december 31 2005 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results can differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our consolidated financial statements and notes 

we present those significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as an integral part of those statements within this 2005 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements 

other than temporary impairments of availableforsale securities we classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as availableforsale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 

a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary impairment and a loss is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible 

a debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary that is impaired is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our statement of income whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the issuer’s financial condition and our ability and intent to hold these investments until fair value recovers which may mean until maturity and to collect all contractual cash flows minor impairments of 5 or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary 

goodwill  we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business 

our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds the carrying amount basically our stockholders’ equity and therefore that no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion in the future additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum future impairment of goodwill that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet 6657 million 

  provision for income taxes  after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in several states and several countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns which represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from timetotime we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is likely that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as our estimates change and actual tax returns and tax audits are settled we recognize any such prior year adjustment in the discrete quarterly period in which it is determined 

stock options  the summary of significant accounting policies includes certain pro forma disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration the blackscholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time our estimates of these variables are made for the purpose of using the valuation model to determine an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike most of our expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow 

pending change in accounting for stock optionbased compensation 

on january 1 2006 we will adopt the provisions of sfas 123r and begin recognizing stock optionbased compensation expense in our 2006 consolidated statement of income using the fair value based method applied on a modified prospective basis it is important to note that this change to the fair value based method will not diminish stockholders’ equity 

the following table in thousands presents the future compensation expense attributable to the 9458900 nonvested options and 31500 restricted shares outstanding at december 31 2005 future stockbased compensation expense is estimated in a manner similar to that used in making our historical pro forma disclosures discussed above except that in order to conform to the requirements of sfas 123r we have also included a reduction for estimated future forfeitures of our stock incentive awards estimated future compensation expense will change to reflect future option grants including reloads future share awards changes in estimated forfeitures and adjustments for actual forfeitures the estimated income tax benefits presented will also vary as compensation expense changes and employees disqualify their incentive stock options as well as to reflect changes in our effective income tax rate

  forwardlooking information 

from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information because of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below and in item 1a of this form 10k annual report under the caption risk factors further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

our future revenues and results of operations will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends favoring participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indexes the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds terminated or significantly altered the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements 

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses stock option grants stock awards changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems 

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management accordingly declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income 

we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 

  the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund’s lowest fair value per share during 2005 in considering this presentation it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below 

 

the comparable potential loss of value presented in our 2004 annual report was 29 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 215 million at december 31 2004 during 2005 we actually experienced net unrealized gains of 12 million 

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as deemed appropriate by management 

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material 

we also have other investments of 75 million at december 31 2005 that are included in our balance sheet in other assets we are at risk for losses on these investments should market conditions deteriorate however our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet additionally we recognize our yen investment in a 10 interest of daiwa sb investments japan at 15 million using the historical cost basis of accounting our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen 

we operate in several foreign countries most prominent among which is great britain we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenue stream is predominately realized in us dollar receipts we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially impact our results of operations

  from time to time we introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund if we believe that its objective will be useful for investors over a long period conversely we may also limit new investments into a mutual fund in order to maintain the integrity of the fund’s investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders at present the following funds are closed to new investors  

these funds continue to accept additional investments from existing shareholders and direct rollovers from retirement plans into new ira accounts that we offer investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select from among the mutual funds based on the distinct objective that is described in each fund’s prospectus investment management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth value or core investing and us global or international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity investment strategies as well as active systematic and municipal taxfree management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a managed disposition service for equity securities distributed from thirdparty venture capital investment pools we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the united states and great britain with additional staff resident in argentina hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market and security analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling in the past we have made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain thirdparty investment research and related services after careful evaluation during 2004 we decided to phase out these arrangements and to pay for all third party investment research and related services directly the impact of this decision to our earnings per share is less than 01 per quarter page 3 of 45   

  we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in our sponsored mutual funds discount brokerage and trust services about 90 of our administrative revenues in 2004 were based on the recovery of expenses incurred to provide the related services administrative revenues therefore do not significantly affect our net income information concerning our revenues results of operations total assets and investment assets under our management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated financial statements and in note 6 thereto which are both included in item 8 of this form 10k 2004 developments financial market results during 2004 were strong though largely the result of a strong boost to the equity markets in the fourth quarter stock indexes closed the first quarter near the levels of the beginning of the year the second quarter saw us stocks produce slightly positive returns while third quarter losses across the markets resulted in negative returns at the end of nine months investor concerns about the strength of the economy rising interest rates global political risks national elections and record high oil prices all weighed heavily on the markets after the november elections in the us the financial markets began rising to end 2004 on a positive note for the first time since 1999 the stock markets in the us rose for two consecutive years the broad sp 500 index rose just under 9 during 2004 and the dow industrials finished the year up over 3 the nasdaq index which is heavily weighted with technology companies finished up nearly 86 the federal reserve began the first of five increases in the federal funds target rate on june 30 2004 — the first rate increases in four years despite these rate increases yields on 10year us treasuries were basically flat for the year in this financial environment total assets under our management ended 2004 at a record 2352 billion up more than 45 billion during the year improving financial market valuations and income added 245 billion to our assets under management during 2004 further and of significant importance to our growth in assets under management during 2004 net cash inflows were very strong and at record levels in total investors entrusted 207 billion more to our management during 2004 including nearly 127 billion into the us mutual funds and 80 billion from across the world into the other portfolios that we manage the previous record net inflows to our us mutual funds were 86 billion in 1996 net cash flows were distributed throughout the year as follows first quarter 64 billion second quarter 42 billion third quarter 58 billion and fourth quarter 43 billion we believe that our strong relative investment performance service capabilities and brand awareness have contributed significantly to our obtaining these new assets for investment management in particular the investment advisory results for the t rowe price funds have been strong more than 81 of the funds across their share classes surpassed their lipper peer group averages on a total return basis for the one and threeyear periods ended december 31 2004 and 75 did so for the five and tenyear periods in addition 64 of our rated retail mutual funds in the us ended the year with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar nearly twice as many as the 325 for the overall industry as a result of the disclosures of trading abuses at several investment management firms beginning in september 2003 the investment management industry and mutual funds in particular have come under greater regulatory scrutiny some regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry were enacted in 2004 and more are expected in the coming months page 4 of 45   

  price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended must approve the investment management agreements annually fund shareholders must approve amendments to these investment management agreements each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations advisory services investment advisory revenues are based upon the daily net assets managed in each fund additional fees are earned for advisoryrelated administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures the advisory fee paid by each of the price funds generally is computed each day by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee for the majority of the price funds the fee is equal to the sum of a group charge that is set based on the combined net assets of those funds and an individual fund charge that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective the 2004 fee rates determined in this manner varied from a low of 32 basis points for the us treasury money fund to a high of 106 basis points for the emerging markets stock international discovery and latin america funds to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of the fee and each overall fund fee decreases details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities the investor class of all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission or 12b1 fee noload mutual fund shares offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios certain of the t rowe price mutual funds also offer an advisor andor r class of shares that are distributed to mutual fund shareholders through thirdparty financial intermediaries these share classes incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services our subsidiary t rowe price investment services is the principal distributor of the t rowe price mutual fund shares we recognize 12b1 fee revenue on these classes of fund shares pursuant to the funds’ 12b1 plans payment of the fee is made to each intermediary pursuant to the 12b1 plans and each intermediary’s agreement with t rowe price investment services in accounting for the 12b1 fees the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding administrative revenue in our consolidated statement of income we also recognize the corresponding expense for the payments to each thirdparty financial intermediary in our consolidated statement of income as part of other operating expenses the revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third party intermediaries are equal in amount and therefore do not impact our net operating income page 5 of 45

  as a result of the disclosures of trading abuses at several investment management firms beginning in september 2003 the investment management industry and mutual funds in particular have come under greater regulatory scrutiny some regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry were enacted in 2004 and more are expected in the coming months in an improving market environment for 2005 we would expect to increase our expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts may involve significant costs that precede the recognition of any future revenues that we may realize from increases to our assets under management results of operations 2004 versus 2003 both net revenues and total revenues increased more than 281 million to nearly 13 billion net operating income increased 160 million to 525 million from 365 million net income increased about 110 million to 337 million up more than 48 from 2275 million in 2003 diluted earnings per share increased nearly 42 from 177 to 251 investment advisory revenues were up 32 or 251 million in 2004 compared to 2003 increased assets under management drove the change as average mutual fund assets were more than 128 billion almost 29 billion higher than the 994 billion average in 2003 average assets in other managed portfolios were almost 79 billion in 2004 up more than 18 billion versus the average of 605 billion in 2003 total average assets under management increased 470 billion during 2004 to end the year at nearly 207 million investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 178 million mutual fund assets ended 2004 at 1455 billion up 28 billion from the beginning of the year market appreciation and income net of dividends paid and not reinvested added 153 billion to mutual fund assets during 2004 and net investor inflows added another 127 billion net cash flows during 2004 were supported broadly by the financial intermediary individual direct and defined contribution retirement plan channels and were concentrated in the us domestic stock mutual funds the midcap value equity income growth stock capital appreciation and midcap growth funds each added more than 1 billion of net investor inflows and together accounted for 95 billion of the funds’ net inflows in 2004 bond and money market funds added 1 billion of net investor flows while the international stock funds had net outflows of less than 500 million investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased more than 73 million to almost 293 million in 2004 ending assets in these portfolios were 897 billion up 172 billion since the beginning of the year net inflows to these portfolios were 8 billion while market appreciation and income added 92 billion in 2004 investment activity through financial intermediaries in the united states japan and europe and new institutional investors including assignments from europe and australia were responsible for these new investment dollars administrative fees and other income increased 30 million during 2004 to nearly 248 million the change in these revenues includes 20 million from our mutual fund transfer agent services including our defined contribution plan recordkeeping service additionally revenues increased 75 million from 12b1 distribution fees received on greater assets under management in the advisor and r classes of our sponsored mutual fund shares these changes page 14 of 45 

  in administrative fees are generally offset by similar changes in related operating expenses that we incur to provide these services and distribute the advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares through third party financial intermediaries operating expenses in 2004 were 121 million more than in the prior year our largest expense compensation and related costs increased 20 or 75 million from 2003 the number of our associates their compensation and the costs of their employee benefits have all increased our 2004 bonus program was higher than the prior year based on our better operating results and the strong relative investment performance that our investment managers achieved base salaries for our associates were increased modestly on january 1 and we added more than 350 associates during 2004 primarily to handle volumerelated activities and business growth at december 31 2004 we employed 4139 associates advertising and promotion expenditures during 2004 were up 15 million compared to 2003 we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first quarter of 2005 will be similar to the fourth quarter of 2004 with succeeding quarters in 2005 being higher than those of the corresponding 2004 quarters while market conditions will dictate the exact level of our spending we expect that our advertising and promotion expenditures for the year 2005 will be 10 to 15 higher than in 2004 we vary our promotional spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad depreciation and amortization expense decreased 5 million in 2004 offsetting the increase of 39 million in other occupancy and facility costs longerlived buildings and nondepreciable land account for twothirds of the net book value of our property and equipment at december 31 2004 costs of rented facilities and related operating costs were higher in 2004 other operating expenses in 2004 increased 324 million including 75 million paid based on greater assets under management that are sourced through financial intermediaries that distribute our advisor and r classes of mutual fund shares these costs are funded from an equal increase in our administrative revenues recognized from 12b1 fees as discussed above for 2004 we increased our charitable contribution to our corporate foundation by 6 million other operating expenses this year have risen to meet increased business demands they include among other things travel costs information services and professional fees for legal audit and consulting services and regulatory compliance in the past we have made modest use of fully permissible payments by brokers to obtain thirdparty investment research and related services after careful evaluation during 2004 we decided to phase out these arrangements and to pay for all third party investment research and related services directly the impact of this decision to our earnings per share is less than 01 per quarter overall net operating income for 2004 increased 160 million or 44 from 2003 our net nonoperating income which includes the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest income and credit facility expenses increased 8 million from 2003 to 85 million greater cash balances and higher interest rates in 2004 added 25 million greater returns on fund investments added 16 million and gains recognized from the sale of investments in sponsored mutual funds added 12 million foreign currency balances produced exchange rate gains of more than 1 million in 2004 compared with losses of 1 million on our yendenominated debt before it was repaid in page 15 of 45 

  late 2003 interest and related credit facility costs were down 7 million in 2004 as we repaid all outstanding debt in 2003 and reduced the size and cost of our credit facilities on an ongoing basis in 2004 the 2004 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is 368 for 2004 down 1 from 2003 greater taxexempt and nontaxable dividend income use of foreign net operating loss carryforwards and settlements of prior year taxes at lower rates all contributed to this lower rate we expect our effective tax rate to rise to 371 for 2005 2003 versus 2002 total revenues increased 73 million to 999 million and net revenues increased 72 million to 996 million net income increased 332 million or 17 to 2275 million diluted earnings per share increased 16 from 152 to 177 investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 392 million on higher average assets under management which increased 73 billion from 921 billion in 2002 to 994 billion in 2003 market appreciation and income net of dividends paid and not reinvested added 227 billion to mutual fund assets during 2003 and net investor inflows added another 75 billion as a result fund assets under management increased from 873 billion at the beginning of 2003 to 1175 billion at december 31 2003 stock funds had net investor subscriptions of 64 billion while bond and money market funds added net inflows of 11 billion investors in the midcap growth equity income and growth stock funds accounted for 39 billion of the net inflows during the year bond fund investors seeking higher yields added 9 billion to the high yield fund investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 229 million to 2192 million in 2003 average assets for the year were 605 billion 5 billion higher than in 2002 yearend assets in these portfolios increased 192 billion to 725 billion at december 31 2003 net inflows to these portfolios were 58 billion in 2003 thirdparty distribution efforts and additions from new institutional investors both in the us and overseas were responsible for the new investment dollars fees from our managed disposition service for equity securities distributed from venture capital investment pools accounted for 22 million of the advisory revenue increase though recurring these fees will vary significantly over time and through different phases of the market cycle administrative revenues and other income increased 101 million to 2175 million in 2003 this increase was primarily attributable to increased 12b1 distribution fees received based on greater assets under management in the advisor class shares of our sponsored mutual funds and to the transfer agency and participant recordkeeping services that we provide for defined contribution retirement plans these revenue changes are generally offset by similar changes in the expenses that we incur to distribute the advisor shares through third parties and provide the services to the retirement plans our discount brokerage operation added 15 million of the increased revenues from commissions earned on greater trading volume operating expenses in 2003 were 275 million higher than in 2002 our largest expense compensation and related costs including bonuses increased 7 to 383 million at december 31 2003 we employed 3783 associates up 2 over the year advertising and promotion expenditures were flat versus the 2002 year as we lowered spending during the first nine months of 2003 due to financial market conditions the final quarter of 2003 saw an increase in our advertising and promotional spending to 204 million or 35 of 2003’s total expense page 16 of 45 

  depreciation and amortization expense decreased 53 million new capital additions in 2003 were less than depreciation expense and the depreciable book value of our property and equipment is lower than in the prior year other operating expenses increased 58 million due primarily to the 43 million increase in distribution costs to third parties which offset the corresponding revenues recognized from the 12b1 fees discussed above overall net operating income for 2003 increased nearly 455 million or 14 from 2002 our net nonoperating results which include the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest and credit facility expenses improved from a loss of 109 million in 2002 to a gain of 5 million in 2003 during 2002 we recognized net investment losses of 102 million on our mutual fund investments private equity investments and our investments in sponsored collateralized bond obligations interest and related costs were down 9 million from 2002 as we repaid all of our outstanding debt obligations during 2003 the 2003 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is slightly higher than that of 2002 due primarily to credits in the 2002 year arising from lower than previously estimated 2001 state income tax liabilities capital resources and liquidity during 2004 stockholders’ equity increased from 13 billion to 17 billion available net liquid assets including our mutual fund investments in which there are no unrealized losses were nearly 600 million at the beginning of 2005 a 300 million undrawn committed credit facility expiring in june 2007 is available to the company operating activities provided cash flows of 374 million in 2004 up 77 million from 2003 including 110 million of increased net income net cash used in investing activities totaled 76 million and net cash used in financing activities totaled 35 million in 2004 net cash expended in investing activities increased 22 million versus 2003 our net cash investments in sponsored mutual funds increased 25 million and our capital expenditures increased 11 million offsetting these amounts was 11 million of lower net savings bank investments due to lower net depositor inflows in 2004 net cash used in financing activities decreased 83 million versus 2003 increased stock option exercises due to our higher common stock valuations generated 48 million of greater cash proceeds in 2004 in 2003 we also repaid our last outstanding debt of nearly 57 million offsetting these changes were the larger 11 million of new savings bank deposits received in 2003 and 125 million more in dividends paid in 2004 we again increased dividends paid to our stockholders in 2004 and raised our quarterly rate from 19 to 23 per share in december comparatively operating activities in 2003 provided cash flows of 297 million in 2003 up 28 million from 2002 including 33 million of increased net income offset by lower depreciation expense of 5 million cash from our operating activities were used to fund 54 million of net investing activities and 118 million of net financing activities in 2003 net cash expended in investing activities in 2003 decreased 41 million versus 2002 primarily due to the investment of the more than 40 million of greater net depositor inflows made at our savings bank subsidiary in 2002 net cash used in financing activities decreased more than 24 million versus 2002 we repurchased fewer common shares in 2003 and funded them entirely from the page 17 of 45 

  proceeds of stock option exercises in 2002 we expended a net of more than 70 million on greater share repurchase activity while also receiving the larger 40 million net inflow of new savings bank deposits we again increased dividends paid to our stockholders in 2003 property and equipment expenditures in 2005 including those for our buildout of business continuity facilities and supporting operations are anticipated to be about 625 million and are expected to be funded from operating cash flows contractual obligations the following table presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2004 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2005 and future years  

we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional equity investments totaling 53 million at december 31 2004 critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results could differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our financial statements and notes thereto we have historically presented those significant accounting policies that we use in the preparation of our financial statements as an integral part of those statements and have done so again in this 2004 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities we classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held for investment by our savings bank subsidiary as available for sale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss or impairment to determine if that loss or impairment is other than temporary page 18 of 45 

  a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary loss and an impairment is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible a debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary that is impaired is considered to have an other than temporary loss that we recognize in our income statement whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the issuer’s financial condition and our intent to hold that security minor impairments of 5 or less that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary goodwill we evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for possible impairment on an annual basis in the third quarter of each year using a fair value approach we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business goodwill would be considered impaired whenever our historical carrying amount exceeds the fair value of our investment advisory business our annual testing has demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeds the carrying amount basically our stockholders’ equity and therefore that no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion when we conduct our evaluation in future years additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash impairment charge to be recognized we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum possible future impairment charge that we could incur is the total goodwill recognized in our balance sheet 666 million provision for income taxes after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our largest annual expense we operate in several states and several other countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns which represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from timetotime we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements as a result it is likely that additions to or reductions of income tax expense will occur each year for prior reporting periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled stock options the summary of significant accounting policies includes certain pro forma disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial page 19 of 45 

  instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration the blackscholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time additionally the recognition of expense fluctuates based on the forfeiture rate for unvested options when employees leave our company the tax benefit will also fluctuate based on the extent to which our associates disqualify their incentive stock option grants our estimates for the variables used in the valuation model are made for the purpose of estimating an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike almost all other expenses the resulting charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow newly issued accounting pronouncement on stock options on december 16 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb revised statement no 123 sharebased payment which will require us to recognize stock optionbased compensation expense in our income statement beginning in the third quarter of 2005 the calculation of compensation expense to then be recognized is similar to that used in our pro forma disclosures discussed above except that we will also include a reduction for estimated future forfeitures these estimates will be adjusted over time to reflect actual forfeitures at december 31 2004 we had 9968550 options outstanding that will vest over the remaining period through december 2009 compensation expense to be recognized in future periods as these options vest and the related tax benefits will be amortized as follows  

these amounts will change to reflect future option grants estimated and actual forfeitures and tax benefits that arise upon the future disqualification of incentive stock option grants it is important to note that the use of the fair value method to record compensation expense for stockbased plans does not diminish total stockholders’ equity forwardlooking information from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this annual report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of page 20 of 45

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management accordingly declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income page 21 of 45 

  we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund’s lowest fair value per share during 2004 in considering this presentation it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below  

the comparable potential loss of value shown in last year’s annual report was 35 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 162 million at the end of 2003 during 2004 we actually experienced net unrealized gains of 21 million as positive market conditions significantly improved the value of our fund investments over the course of the year investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as deemed appropriate by management the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material we also make other investments that we include in our balance sheet in other assets we are at risk for losses on these investments should market conditions deteriorate at december 31 2004 we hold a 12 million investment in a sponsored highyield collateralized bond obligation and investments totaling 53 million in private equity and other entities our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the 65 million recognized in our balance sheet additionally we have recognized our yen investment in a 10 interest of daiwa sb investments japan at 15 million using the historical cost basis of accounting our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen the us dollar weakened versus the currencies of several foreign countries in which we operate most prominent among which is great britain we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and page 22 of 45 

  liabilities associated with these operations though our revenue stream is predominately realized in us dollar receipts we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially impact our results of operations

approximately 2030 from each of the following individual us investors us defined contribution retirement plans thirdparty distributors in the us and internationally and institutional investors in the us and foreign countries our largest client account relationship excluding the t rowe price funds is with a thirdparty distributor that accounted for less than 4 of our investment advisory revenues in 2003 in 2001 our uk investment advisory subsidiary t rowe price global investment services expanded our investment advisory business to europe where we now offer separate account management to institutional investors subadvisory services and a series of luxembourgdomiciled mutual funds with share classes for institutional investors and for individuals reached through third party

we hold a 10 interest our international clients account for 4 of our total assets under management at december 31 2003 we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors for example mutual fund shareholders can exchange balances among mutual funds as permitted when economic and market conditions and their investment needs change from time to time we page 2   introduce new funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund if we believe that its objective can be useful for investors over a long period of time we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans discount brokerage and trust services about 90 of our administrative revenues in 2003 were based on the recovery of expenses incurred to provide the related services administrative revenues therefore do not significantly affect our net income we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the united states and great britain with additional staff resident in argentina france hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by brokerage firms in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists political observers commentators government experts and market and security analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling

each fund’s prospectus management of other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth or value investing and us global or international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended equity investment strategies as well as active and systematic management strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services include management of stable value investment contracts and a managed disposition service for equity securities distributed

contained in our consolidated statements of income and in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k 2003 developments improving financial market valuations and income added more than 36 billion to our assets under management during 2003 financial markets generally bottomed out in the first quarter and then began an upward movement that continued through the rest of the year before accelerating in the fourth quarter after three down years the dow jones industrials ended up 25 and the nasdaq composite led primarily by page 3   largercap technology companies was up 50 the broader market also captured significant gains as the sp 500 returned nearly 29 net investor inflows added more than 13 billion to our assets under management in 2003 including nearly 75 billion to the t rowe price mutual funds for us investors and 58 billion to other investment portfolios reflecting the very significant improvement in the financial markets late in the year the fourth quarter of 2003 produced the largest net inflows accounting for 46 billion or nearly 35 of the net inflows for the year mutual fund inflows in 2003 were third only to the peak annual inflows of 86 billion and 85 billion that we experienced in 1996 and 1997 respectively the positive financial market backdrop in 2003 was diminished over the last four months of the year by news of trading abuses at several investment management firms including revelations that certain fund companies permitted excessive trading or illegal afterhours trading in addition certain intermediaries that process fund transactions allegedly assisted some investors in executing improper mutual fund trades we have conducted thorough reviews of our firm’s policies procedures and practices in the principal areas that have been implicated in the various enforcement proceedings and investigations that have been announced to date this has allowed us both to confirm the continuing effectiveness of our existing policies procedures and practices and to make or consider certain enhancements as a result of the disclosures at other investment management firms the industry and mutual funds in particular have come under greater regulatory scrutiny new legislation and regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry are expected in the coming months we continue to benefit from the performance of our managed investment portfolios including the t rowe price funds which have performed well relative to their peers sixtyfive percent of the funds and their share classes surpassed their lipper peer group averages on a total return basis for the oneyear period ended december 31 2003 and at least 75 did so for the three five and tenyear periods in addition 65 of our rated retail mutual funds in the us ended the year with an overall rating of four or five stars from morningstar price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of t rowe price group as defined in the investment company act of 1940 as amended must approve the investment management agreements annually amendments to management agreements must be approved by fund shareholders each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations advisory services investment advisory revenues are based upon the daily net assets managed in each fund additional fees are earned for advisoryrelated administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees of the price funds regularly review our fee structures page 4   the advisory fee paid by each of the price funds generally is computed each day by multiplying a fund’s net assets by a specific fee for the majority of the price funds the fee is equal to the sum of a group charge that is set based on the combined net assets of those funds and an individual fund charge that is set based on the fund’s specific investment objective the 2003 fee rates determined in this manner varied from a low of 32 basis points for the us treasury money fund to a high of 107 basis points for the international discovery fund to the extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of the fee and each overall fund fee decreases details of each fund’s fee arrangement are available in its prospectus each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of investing opportunities all price funds can be purchased in the united states on a noload basis without a sales commission noload mutual funds offer investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios our advisor and r classes of fund shares are sold through financial intermediaries and incur 12b1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points respectively for distribution administration and personal services we recognize 12b1 fees as offsetting components of administrative revenues and other operating expenses we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or director fees and expenses several of the price funds have different fee arrangements the equity market index funds and the summit funds each have single allinclusive fees covering all investment management and operating expenses each of the funds in the spectrum series and the retirement date specific series of mutual funds invest in a broadly diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest mutual funds for institutional investors each have separate advisory fee arrangements we usually commit that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period we absorb all advisory fees and other mutual fund expenses in excess of these selfimposed limits except as noted above for 12b1 fees we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with our distribution of the price funds our costs include advertising and direct mail communications to potential fund shareholders as well as a substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries marketing efforts are focused in the print media and in recent years promotional activities have expanded to television and the internet in addition we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor page 5   interest market conditions new investment offerings and the development

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our sponsored mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios investors outside the united states have grown over the last three years and now account for 4 of our assets under management at december 31 2003 we manage a broad range of us and international stock bond and money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations total assets under our management were up more than 49 billion during 2003 and ended the year at an alltime record of 190 billion including 1355 billion in equity securities and 545 billion in bond and money market holdings these investment assets include 1175 billion in the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states and 725 billion in other investment portfolios consisting of separately managed accounts subadvised funds and other sponsored investment portfolios offered to investors outside the united states and through variable annuity life insurance plans improving financial market valuations and income added more than 36 billion to our assets under management during 2003 while net investor inflows added more than 13 billion the previous periodend record for assets under management was 185 billion at march 31 2000 the month that equity market valuations peaked and the threeyear market downturn began in 2003 financial markets generally bottomed out in the first quarter and then began an upward movement that continued through the rest of the year before accelerating in the fourth quarter a us market environment with income tax cuts and low interest rates provided the underlying foundation for the market recovery after three down years the dow jones industrials ended up 25 and the nasdaq composite led primarily by largercap technology companies was up 50 the broader market also captured significant gains as the sp 500 returned nearly 29 while the early indications are that improving corporate profits and low interest rates will be the basis for continued market gains in 2004 we do expect that the financial market growth rate in the coming year will be lower than that of 2003 page 13   this positive financial market backdrop was diminished over the last four months of 2003 by news of trading abuses at several investment management firms including revelations that certain fund companies permitted excessive trading or illegal afterhours trading in addition certain intermediaries that process fund transactions allegedly assisted some investors in executing improper mutual fund trades we have conducted a thorough review of our policies procedures and practices with respect to inappropriate trading activities and we have found them to be sound as a result of the disclosures at other investment management firms the industry and mutual funds in particular have come under greater regulatory scrutiny new legislation and regulations designed to strengthen controls and restore investor confidence in the industry are expected in the coming months net cash inflows during 2003 were also a strong driver of increased assets under management defined contribution retirement plans which generally provide individual investors a regular opportunity to have recurring cash investments made directly from each paycheck into personal retirement accounts were the source of steady cash inflows through the market downturn as 2003 progressed the individual investor began returning to the financial markets after an almost three year absence and our cash inflows increased we reach individual investors directly and through thirdparty distribution efforts institutional investors both in the united states and in foreign countries also added net cash inflows during the year in total investors added nearly 75 billion to the t rowe price mutual funds in the us and 58 billion to the other portfolios that we manage reflecting the very significant improvement in the financial markets the fourth quarter of 2003 produced the largest net inflows accounting for 46 billion or nearly 35 of the net inflows for the year for the year the mutual fund inflows were third only to our peak inflows of 86 billion and 85 billion experienced in 1996 and 1997 respectively in this improving market environment we expect to increase our expenditures to attract new investment advisory clients and additional investments from our existing clients these efforts may involve significant costs that would precede the recognition of any future revenues that we might realize from increases to our assets under management results of operations 2003 versus 2002 total revenues increased 73 million to 999 million and net revenues increased 72 million to 996 million net income increased 332 million or 17 to 2275 million diluted earnings per share increased 16 from 152 to 177 investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states increased 392 million on higher average assets under management which increased 73 billion from 921 billion in 2002 to 994 billion in 2003 market appreciation and income net of dividends paid and not reinvested added 227 billion to mutual fund assets during 2003 and net investor inflows added another 75 billion as a result fund assets under management increased from 873 billion at the beginning of 2003 to 1175 billion at december 31 2003 stock funds had net investor subscriptions of 64 billion while bond and money market page 14   funds added net inflows of 11 billion investors in the midcap growth equity income and growth stock funds accounted for 39 billion of the net inflows during the year bond fund investors seeking higher yields added 9 billion to the high yield fund investment advisory revenues earned on the other investment portfolios that we manage increased 229 million to 2192 million in 2003 average assets for the year were 605 billion 5 billion higher than in 2002 yearend assets in these portfolios increased 192 billion to 725 billion at december 31 2003 net inflows to these portfolios were 58 billion in 2003 thirdparty distribution efforts and additions from new institutional investors both in the us and overseas were responsible for the new investment dollars fees from our managed disposition service for equity securities distributed from venture capital investment pools accounted for 22 million of the advisory revenue increase though recurring these fees will vary significantly over time and through different phases of the market cycle administrative revenues and other income increased 101 million to 2175 million in 2003 this increase is primarily attributable to increased 12b1 distribution fees received based on greater assets under management in the advisor class shares of our sponsored mutual funds and to the transfer agency and participant recordkeeping services that we provide for defined contribution retirement plans these revenue changes are generally offset by similar changes in the expenses that we incur to distribute the advisor shares through third parties and provide the services to the retirement plans our discount brokerage operation added 15 million of the increased revenues from commissions earned on greater trading volume operating expenses in 2003 were 275 million higher than in 2002 our largest expense compensation and related costs including bonuses increased 7 to 383 million at december 31 2003 we employed 3783 associates up 2 over the year advertising and promotion expenditures were flat versus the 2002 year as we lowered spending during the first nine months of 2003 due to financial market conditions the final quarter of 2003 saw an increase in our advertising and promotional spending to 204 million or 35 of 2003’s total expense we vary our promotional spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as the extent of our efforts to expand our investor base in the united states and abroad we expect our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first quarter of 2004 to be similar to the fourth quarter of 2003 with succeeding quarters being higher than that of the comparable 2003 periods market conditions will dictate the exact level of our spending depreciation and amortization expense decreased 53 million new capital additions in 2003 were less than depreciation expense and the depreciable book value of our property and equipment is lower than in the prior year other operating expenses increased 58 million due primarily to the 43 million increase in distribution costs to third parties which offset the corresponding revenues recognized from the 12b1 fees discussed above overall net operating income for 2003 increased nearly 455 million or 14 from 2002 our net nonoperating results which include the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest and credit facility expenses improved from a loss of 109 million in 2002 to a gain of 5 million in 2003 during 2002 we recognized net investment losses of 102 million on our page 15   mutual fund investments private equity investments and our investments in sponsored collateralized bond obligations interest and related costs were down 9 million from 2002 as we repaid all of our outstanding debt obligations during 2003 the 2003 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is slightly higher than that of 2002 due primarily to credits in the 2002 year arising from lower than previously estimated 2001 state income tax liabilities 2002 versus 2001 net income decreased about 16 million or 1 to 1943 million diluted earnings per share was unchanged at 152 as lower weighted average shares and share equivalents outstanding due to our repurchase of 28 million common shares in 2002 and our common stock’s generally lower per share market value offset the decline in net income with the adoption of the new accounting standard for goodwill on january 1 2002 we ceased amortizing the goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet after excluding the 2001 amortization of goodwill in the amount of 289 million adjusted net income for 2001 was 2248 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 174 total revenues declined 706 million or 7 to 9258 million and net revenues declined a similar 7 or 719 million to 9235 million investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds distributed in the united states decreased 435 million as average fund assets under management were 921 billion during 2002 66 billion less than in 2001 weakness in financial market valuations that began in early 2000 continued for three years during the second half of 2002 us equity market valuations fell to levels last seen in the first half of 1997 mutual fund assets ended 2002 at almost 873 billion down 107 billion from december 31 2001 and nearly 49 billion from the 2002 average the price funds had 31 billion of net cash inflows during 2002 the highest net annual inflows since 1998 however market depreciation net of income and dividends paid but not reinvested more than offset the inflows and reduced fund assets 138 billion in 2002 money market and bond funds had net investor subscriptions of 19 billion and stock funds added an additional 12 billion of net inflows bond fund investors seeking higher yields added 704 million to the high yield fund in 2002 net inflows of 27 billion to us domestic stock funds in 2002 were led primarily by valueoriented investors in the equity income midcap value and smallcap value funds while international stock fund investors had net redemptions of 15 billion during the year investment advisory revenues earned from the other investment portfolios that we manage were down 112 million in 2002 on lower assets under management that also resulted from lower market valuations the value of the assets in these portfolios decreased 5 billion during 2002 to 533 billion at year end as net cash inflows of 17 billion were more than offset by 67 billion of market value losses additionally advisory fees from our managed disposition service were down 5 million from 2001 to 12 million in 2002 these fees declined during 2001 and 2002 as market conditions were unfavorable and investment portfolios changed administrative revenues and other income decreased 124 million from 2001 to 2074 million in 2002 this decrease is primarily attributable to transfer agency and participant recordkeeping services that we provide for defined contribution retirement plans and was partially offset by a 23 million increase in 12b1 distribution fees received from our advisor class of mutual fund shares page 16   total revenues also increased 15 million on greater investment income from the larger investment portfolio of our savings bank subsidiary our savings bank depositor base increased from 25 million at december 31 2001 to 81 million at the end of 2002 interest expense on the higher deposits increased 13 million we manage the assets of our savings bank as a portfolio in a manner similar to that of our other investment advisory clients the net of our investment portfolio income and depositor interest expense results in a net revenue amount that is similar to the investment advisory fees earned on the investment portfolios that we manage operating expenses in 2002 were 812 million less than in 2001 the elimination of the amortization of goodwill accounts for 289 million or about 36 of the decrease our largest expense compensation and related costs decreased 7 or 274 million from 2001 our average staff size use of temporary personnel in the technology operations group and total levels of compensation were all lower in 2002 attrition and a late 2001 staff reduction lowered our average number of associates in 2002 by 6 from the average 2001 level at december 31 2002 we employed 3710 associates up 2 from the 2002 average advertising and promotion expenditures were down 56 million in 2002 as we again curtailed these expenditures due to weak financial market conditions that made investors more cautious and less active occupancy and facility costs and other operating expenses in 2002 decreased 58 million and 125 million respectively versus 2001 these reductions primarily reflect the first half 2001 completions of several technology initiatives as well as the international facilities and infrastructure transition that resulted from the august 2000 purchase of robert fleming holdings’ interest in our consolidated subsidiary t rowe price international through the first half of 2001 we incurred substantial costs to establish and transition this entity to new operating facilities with appropriate infrastructure support for their international investment operations robert fleming affiliates previously provided the space and infrastructure support for these offices overall net operating income was up 93 million from 2001 to 2002 including the goodwill amortization of 289 million in 2001 that did not recur in 2002 nonoperating income and expenses include the recognition of investment gains and losses as well as interest expense incurred on our indebtedness while we recognized 31 million of net investment income in 2001 we experienced a net investment loss of 83 million in 2002 as interest and dividend income of 33 million was more than offset by losses across all of our investment portfolios during 2002 we recognized 39 million of losses on dispositions and other than temporary impairments of our mutual fund holdings 33 million of losses on our holdings of collateralized bond obligations 14 million of losses from exchange rate fluctuations on our yen debt and 30 million of valuation decreases in our private equity holdings our mutual fund investment holdings at december 31 2002 include an aggregate net gain before income taxes of 113 million that is included in stockholders’ equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income this net gain has not been recognized in our statements of income and comprises aggregate gains of 155 million and aggregate losses of 42 million that have arisen since june 30 2002 and are considered temporary interest expense on our debt is down more than 9 million due to lower page 17   principal balances and interest rates in 2002 overall we recognized a net nonoperating loss of 109 million in 2002 versus net nonoperating income of 194 million in 2001 the 2002 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is lower than that of 2001 due primarily to eliminating the amortization of nondeductible goodwill in 2002 capital resources and liquidity during 2003 stockholders’ equity increased from 11 billion to more than 13 billion available net liquid assets including our mutual fund investments in which there are no unrealized losses total more than 275 million at the beginning of 2004 unused committed credit facilities that are available to the company include 500 million expiring in june 2005 and 80 million expiring in june 2004 during 2003 we retired our remaining 567 million of outstanding debt operating activities provided cash flows of 297 million in 2003 up 28 million from 2002 including 33 million of increased net income offset by lower depreciation expense of 5 million cash from our operating activities were used to fund 54 million of net investing activities and 118 million of net financing activities in 2003 net cash expended in investing activities decreased 41 million versus 2002 primarily due to the investment of the more than 40 million of greater net depositor inflows made at our savings bank subsidiary in 2002 net cash used in financing activities decreased more than 24 million versus 2002 we repurchased fewer common shares in 2003 and funded them entirely from the proceeds of stock option exercises in 2002 we expended a net of more than 70 million on greater share repurchase activity while also receiving the larger 40 million net inflow of new savings bank deposits we again increased dividends paid to our stockholders in 2003 and raised our quarterly rate to 19 per share in december comparatively for 2001 operating activities provided cash flows of 290 million on lower net income that included a 29 million noncash charge for amortization of goodwill operating activities that year funded nearly all of the net investing activities of 9 million and net financing activities of 282 million mutual fund proceeds in 2001 of 89 million were used to fund 42 million of investments and 41 million of capital expenditures we repaid 205 million of our bank borrowings and used 31 million to repurchase our common shares in 2001 financing activities increased savings bank deposits during the year were used to fund the net investments made by our savings bank subsidiary the following table presents a summary of our future obligations under the terms of existing operating leases and other contractual cash purchase commitments at december 31 2003 other purchase commitments include contractual amounts that will be due for the purchase of goods or services to be used in our operations and may be cancelable at earlier times than those indicated under certain conditions that may involve termination fees because these obligations are of a normal recurring nature we expect that we will fund them from future cash flows from operations the information presented does not include operating expenses or capital expenditures that will be committed in the normal course of operations in 2004 and future years page 18    we also have outstanding commitments to fund additional investments totaling 44 million at december 31 2003 property and equipment expenditures in 2004 including those for business continuity facilities and support are anticipated to be about 60 million and are expected to be funded from operating cash flows critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting policies and notes to the financial statements making these estimates and judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time accordingly actual amounts or future results could differ materially from those estimates that we include currently in our financial statements and notes thereto we have historically presented those significant accounting policies that we use in the preparation of our financial statements as an integral part of those statements and have done so again in this 2003 annual report in the following discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements the application of these policies often requires significant judgments and estimates other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities we classify our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held in the investment portfolio of our savings bank subsidiary as available for sale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity we next review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss to determine if that loss is other than temporary a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months is presumed to have an other than temporary loss and an impairment is recognized in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible a debt security held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered impaired and an other than temporary loss is recognized whenever we determine that we will probably not collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the issuer’s financial condition and our intent to hold that security goodwill as a result of the adoption of a new financial accounting page 19   standard on january 1 2002 we ceased recording recurring charges to amortize the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet the standard instead requires that we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis using a fair value approach we make that evaluation in the third quarter of each year goodwill is considered impaired whenever the carrying amount of the related reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that unit we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business because our testing in 2002 and 2003 demonstrated that the fair value of our investment advisory business exceeded our carrying amount basically our stockholders’ equity we concluded that no impairment exists should we reach a different conclusion when we conduct our evaluation in subsequent years additional work would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash charge needed to recognize the impairment we must also perform impairment testing at other times if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not that an impairment has been incurred the maximum possible future impairment charge that we could incur is the total goodwill recognized in our balance sheet 666 million provision for income taxes after compensation and related costs our provision for income taxes on our earnings is our second largest annual expense we operate in several states and several other countries through our various subsidiaries and must allocate our income expenses and earnings under the various laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that we have incurred for doing business each year in all of our locations annually we file tax returns which represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations and taxable earnings determinations from timetotime we may also provide for estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in our financial statements in such cases it is possible that additional expense for prior reporting periods may be recorded in subsequent periods as actual tax returns and tax audits are settled stock options the summary of significant accounting policies includes certain pro forma disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize compensation expense associated with our stock option grants fair value methods use a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial instruments to theoretically value stock option grants even though they are not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration the blackscholes option pricing model that we use includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time additionally the recognition of expense fluctuates based on the forfeiture rate for unvested options when employees leave our company our estimates for the variables used in the valuation model are made for the purpose of theoretically determining an expense for each reporting period and are not subsequently adjusted unlike almost all other page 20   expenses the resulting theoretical charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash charge that is never measured by or adjusted based on a cash outflow forwardlooking information from time to time information or statements provided by or on behalf of t rowe price including those within this annual report may contain certain forwardlooking information including information or anticipated information relating to changes in our revenues and net income changes in the amount and composition of our assets under management our expense levels and our expectations regarding financial markets and other conditions readers are cautioned that any forwardlooking information provided by or on behalf of t rowe price is not a guarantee of future performance actual results may differ materially from those in forwardlooking information as a result of various factors including but not limited to those discussed below further forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made and we undertake no obligation to update any forwardlooking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events our future revenues and results will fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of assets under our management such changes result from many factors including among other things cash inflows and outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management our introduction of new mutual funds and investment portfolios and changes in retirement savings trends favoring participantdirected investments and defined contribution plans the ability to attract and retain investors’ assets under our management is dependent on investor sentiment and confidence the relative investment performance of the price mutual funds and other managed investment portfolios as compared to competing offerings and market indices the ability to maintain our investment management and administrative fees at appropriate levels competitive conditions in the mutual fund asset management and broader financial services sectors and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the independent directors of one or more of the price funds determined to terminate or significantly alter the terms of the investment management or related administrative services agreements our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to among other things bonuses changes in our employee count and mix and competitive factors any goodwill impairment that may arise fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international operations expenses and capital costs such as technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor accounts and the goodwill of our page 21   clients and disruptions of services including those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and the mutual fund transfer agent and accounting systems our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other investments 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our management accordingly declines in financial market values directly and negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive financial instruments held for purposes other than trading we do not invest in derivative financial or commodity instruments mutual fund investments have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using each fund’s lowest fair value per share during the past year in considering this presentation it is important to note that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be changed if adverse market conditions persist and we could experience future losses in excess of those presented below  the comparable potential loss of value shown in last year’s annual report was 161 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 1232 million at the end of 2002 during 2003 we actually experienced net unrealized gains of 324 million as positive market conditions significantly improved the value of our fund investments investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by their nature are diversified investment portfolios that invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its investments among many page 22   domestic and international funds in addition investment holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors as deemed appropriate by management the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material we also make other investments that we include in our balance sheet in other assets we are at risk for losses on these investments should market conditions deteriorate at december 31 2003 we hold a 45 million investment in a sponsored highyield collateralized bond obligation and investments totaling 61 million in private equity and other entities our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the 106 million recognized in our balance sheet additionally we have recognized our 10 interest in daiwa sb investments japan at 15 million using the cost basis of accounting our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen because the functional currency of daiwa sb investments is the yen the us dollar weakened versus the currencies of several foreign countries in which we operate most prominent among which is great britain we incur operating expenses and have foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities associated with these operations though our revenue stream is predominately realized in us dollar receipts we do not believe that foreign currency fluctuations materially impact our results of operations

derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment
advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional
investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds and other investment
portfolios our investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value
and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in
financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our
revenues and results of operations

we operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies
primarily t rowe price associates and t rowe price international our advisory

was offered to the public for the first time in 1986 our corporate holding
company structure was put in place in december 2000

total assets under our management decreased 157 billion over the course of
2002 and ended the year at 1406 billion including 887 billion held in

institutional investors our international client base presently accounts for
just over 2 of our assets under management and is included primarily in our
assets sourced from thirdparty distribution and institutional investors our
largest client account relationship excluding the t rowe price funds
accounted for about 35 of our investment advisory revenues in 2002

we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock bond and
money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which are designed to
meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and
institutional investors for example mutual fund shareholders can exchange
balances among mutual funds at any time that economic and market conditions and
their investment needs change from time to time we introduce new funds and
other investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings
respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the
changing needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual
fund if we believe that its objective can be useful for investors over a long
period of time

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our
investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by
several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent
accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer
agent services for defined contribution

retirement plans discount brokerage and trust services more than 90 of our
administrative revenues in 2002 were based on the recovery of expenditures
incurred in providing the related services and they therefore do not
significantly affect our net income

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of
the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal equity and
fixed income investment research capabilities we perform original industry and
company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities
management interviews companypublished financial and other information
financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks

political observers commentators government experts and market and security
analysts our stock selection process for some investment portfolios is based on
quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price
funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select funds based on the
distinct objectives that are detailed in each funds prospectus management of
other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the
price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or
smallcap investing growth or value investing and us global or
international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended
equity investment strategies as well as active and systematic management
strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services

investment assets under our management during the past three years is contained
in our consolidated statements of income and in note 6 to our consolidated
financial statements included in item 8 of this form 10k

recent developments weakness in financial market valuations that began in early
2000 continued through 2002 as the us stock markets declined for the third
straight year the first such threeyear period of decline since 19391941
during 2002 equity security valuations peaked in the first quarter and fell
during the second half of the year reaching a low point in october that was
last seen in the first half of 1997 the equity market declines led assets under
management down to 1406 billion the lowest yearend figure of the past five
years despite this environment our comparative investment performance was
relatively strong as more than 80 of our mutual funds outperformed their lipper
peer groups averages for the one three and fiveyears ended december 31
2002

the decline in equity markets this year depressed mutual fund assets from 980
billion at the start of 2002 to 873 billion at yearend average fund assets
were down 66 billion to 921 billion net cash inflows to the t rowe price
mutual funds totaled 31 billion a significant increase versus recent years
and the most since 1998 but lower market valuations dropped fund assets 138
billion for the year overall net cash inflows aggregated almost 49 billion
in 2002

investors seeking positive yields added 19 billion to our money market and
bond funds in 2002 with those seeking the highest yield adding 700 million to
the high yield fund changing sentiments also saw investors return to our stock
funds which had 12 billion of net inflows equity investors made net
subscriptions of 27 billion into our us domestic stock funds with
valueoriented investors adding to the equity income midcap value and
smallcap value funds international stock fund investing again was out of favor
and those funds had net redemptions of 15 billion total advisory revenues
from mutual funds declined nearly 435 million from 2001 when average fund
assets were 66 billion higher

the other investment portfolios that we manage aggregated 533 billion at
december 31 2002 down 5 billion over the course of the year these portfolios
experienced lower market valuations of 67 billion while adding net inflows of
17 billion primarily from third party distribution efforts and institutional
investors outside the united states enabled by our 2000 acquisition of the 50
noncontrolling interest in t rowe price international we now compete for the
provision of investment advisory services to institutional and individual
investors outside the united states our uk investment advisory subsidiary t
rowe price global investment services has expanded our investment advisory
business to europe where we offer separate account management to institutional
investors and a series of luxembourgdomiciled mutual funds with both
institutional and individual share classes our efforts have focused on
institutional investors and third party distributors of the luxembourg funds
our european initiatives complement those that we began in 1999 in japan through
t rowe price global asset management which subadvises investment assets for
daiwa sb investments in which we hold a 10 interest together our
international client base now accounts for more than 2 of our total assets
under management

we have responded to the unfavorable financial market conditions by meaningfully
reducing our operating expenses in each of the last two years our aim has been
to adjust our spending levels to better reflect business realities while still
sustaining our high client service standards

our operating cash flow and financial condition have remained strong during
2002 we repaid 49 million of debt and expended 96 million to repurchase 28
million shares of our common stock

this past year we introduced a new retirement series of mutual funds with asset
allocations that automatically shift as an investor ages our third party
distribution efforts through financial intermediaries were further strengthened
with the introduction of an r share class for retirement plans and an increase
in the number of funds offering advisor class shares

on the services front we enhanced our ira rollover programs to attract more
assets from the growing retirement plan rollover market and launched a
redesigned web site with new features and better functionality to make it easier
for investors to manage their accounts we also expanded our lineup of free
educational tools by launching an online college investment calculator and
providing internet access to several morningstar investment planning and
guidance tools the first products resulting from an alliance between our firms

price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other
administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment
advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment
management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the

page


t rowe price name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of
directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of us as defined in
the investment company act of 1940 as amended must approve the investment
management agreements annually amendments to management agreements must be
approved by fund shareholders each agreement automatically terminates in the
event of its assignment as defined in the investment company act and
generally either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a
60day notice the termination of one or more of these agreements could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations

advisory services investment advisory revenues are based upon the daily net
assets managed in each fund additional fees are earned for advisoryrelated
administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees
of the price funds regularly review our fee structures

the advisory fee paid by each of the price funds generally is computed each day
by multiplying a funds net assets by a specific fee for the majority of the
price funds the fee is equal to the sum of a group charge that is set based on
the combined net assets of those funds and an individual fund charge that is set
based on the funds specific investment objective the 2002 fee rates determined
in this manner varied from a low of 32 basis points for the us treasury money
fund to a high of 107 basis points for the international discovery funds to the
extent that the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge
component of the fee and therefore each overall fund fee decreases details of
each funds fee arrangement are available in its prospectus

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been
developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of
investing opportunities all price funds can be purchased on a noload basis
without a sales commission noload mutual funds offer investors a lowcost and
relatively easy method of investing in a variety of stock and bond portfolios
our advisor and r classes of fund shares are sold through financial
intermediaries and incur 12b1 fees of up to 25 and 50 basis points
respectively for distribution administration and personal services we
believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution methods and fund
shareholder and administrative services help promote stability of fund assets
through market cycles

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and
the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays
investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund
accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses
legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and mailing
prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees
and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and independent trustee or
director fees and expenses

several of the price funds have different fee arrangements the equity market
index funds and the summit funds each have single allinclusive fees covering
all investment management and operating expenses each of the funds in the
spectrum series and new retirement series of mutual funds invest in a broadly
diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment
advisory fee however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which
they invest mutual funds for institutional investors each have separate
advisory fee arrangements

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

general

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory
services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our
sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios investors outside the
united states account for just over 2 of our assets under management

we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock bond and
money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied
needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment
advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets
under management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the
composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of
operations total assets under our management were 1406 billion at december
31 2002 including 929 billion in equity securities and 477 billion in bond
and money market holdings lower financial market valuations more than offset
our net investor inflows in 2002 and decreased our assets under management by
10 or 157 billion over the course of the year

our expenditures to broaden our investor base may be significant and precede the
revenues that we may obtain from any new investment advisory clients

results of operations

2002 versus 2001 net income decreased about 16 million or 1 to 1943
million diluted earnings per share was unchanged at 152 as lower weighted
average shares and share equivalents outstanding due to our repurchase of 28
million common shares in 2002 and our common stocks generally lower per share
market value offset the decline in net income with the adoption of the new
accounting standard for goodwill on january 1 2002 we have ceased amortizing
the goodwill that is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet after
excluding the 2001 amortization of goodwill in the amount of 289 million
adjusted net income for 2001 was 2248 million and adjusted diluted earnings
per share was 174 total revenues declined 706 million or 7 to 9258
million and net revenues declined a similar 7 or 719 million to 9235
million

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds
distributed in the united states decreased 435 million as average fund assets
under management were 921 billion during 2002 66 billion less than in 2001
weakness in financial market valuations that began in early 2000 have continued
nearly three years during the second half of 2002 us equity market
valuations fell to levels last seen in the first half of 1997 mutual fund
assets ended 2002 at almost 873 billion down 107 billion from december 31
2001 and nearly 49 billion from the 2002 average the price funds had 31
billion of net cash inflows during 2002 the highest net annual inflows since
1998 however market depreciation net of income and dividends paid but not
reinvested more than offset the inflows and reduced fund assets 138 billion
in 2002 money market and bond funds had net investor subscriptions of 19
billion and stock funds added an additional 12 billion of net inflows bond
fund investors seeking higher yields added 704 million to the high yield fund
in 2002 net inflows of 27 billion to us domestic stock funds in 2002 were
led


                                    page 13
page


primarily by valueoriented investors in the equity income midcap value and
smallcap value funds while international stock fund investors had net
redemptions of 15 billion during the year

investment advisory revenues earned from the other investment portfolios that we
manage were down 112 million in 2002 on lower assets under management that
also resulted from lower market valuations the value of the assets in these
portfolios decreased 5 billion during 2002 to 533 billion at year end as net
cash inflows of 17 billion were more than offset by 67 billion of market
value losses additionally performancebased advisory fees were down 5 million
from 2001 to 12 million in 2002 we earn these fees primarily from a managed
disposition service for distributions of venture capital investments and though
recurring these fees will vary significantly over time they have declined
during the past two years as market conditions were unfavorable and investment
portfolios changed

administrative revenues and other income decreased 124 million from 2001 to
2074 million in 2002 this decrease is primarily attributable to transfer
agency and participant recordkeeping services that we provide for defined
contribution retirement plans and was partially offset by a 23 million
increase in 12b1 distribution fees received from our advisor class of mutual
fund shares these revenue changes are generally offset by similar changes in
the expenses that we incurred to provide the services and distribute the advisor
shares through third parties

total revenues also increased 15 million on greater investment income from the
larger investment portfolio of our savings bank subsidiary our savings bank
depositor base increased from 25 million at december 31 2001 to 81 million at
the end of 2002 interest expense on the higher deposits increased 13 million
we manage the assets of our savings bank as a portfolio in a manner similar to
that of our other investment advisory clients the net of our investment
portfolio income and depositor interest expense results in a net revenue amount
that is similar to the investment advisory fees earned on the investment
portfolios that we manage

operating expenses in 2002 were 812 million less than in 2001 the elimination
of the amortization of goodwill accounts for 289 million or about 36 of the
decrease our largest expense compensation and related costs decreased 7 or
274 million from 2001 our average staff size use of temporary personnel in
the technology operations group and total levels of compensation were all lower
in 2002 attrition and a late 2001 staff reduction lowered our average number of
associates in 2002 by 6 from the average 2001 level at december 31 2002 we
employed 3710 associates up 2 from the 2002 average advertising and
promotion expenditures were down 56 million in 2002 as we again curtailed
these expenditures due to weak financial market conditions that have made
investors more cautious and less active we vary our promotional spending based
on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts to expand our
investor base in the united states and abroad we expect our advertising and
promotion expenditures in the first half of 2003 to be similar to the first half
of 2002 market conditions in the second half of the year will dictate our
spending then

occupancy and facility costs and other operating expenses in 2002 decreased 58
million and 125 million respectively versus 2001 these reductions primarily
reflect the first half 2001 completions of several technology initiatives as
well as the international facilities and infrastructure transition that resulted
from the august 2000 purchase of

robert fleming holdings interest in our consolidated subsidiary t rowe price
international through the first half of 2001 we incurred substantial costs to
establish and transition this entity to new operating facilities with
appropriate infrastructure support for their international investment
operations robert fleming affiliates previously provided the space and
infrastructure support for these offices

overall net operating income was up 93 million from 2001 to 2002 including
the goodwill amortization of 289 million in 2001 that did not recur in 2002

nonoperating income and expenses include the recognition of investment gains
and losses as well as interest expense incurred on our indebtedness while we
recognized 31 million of net investment income in 2001 we experienced a net
investment loss of 83 million in 2002 as interest and dividend income of 33
million was more than offset by losses across all of our investment portfolios
during 2002 we recognized 39 million of losses on dispositions and other than
temporary impairments of our mutual fund holdings 33 million of losses on our
holdings of collateralized bond obligations 14 million of losses from
exchange rate fluctuations on our yen debt and 30 million of valuation
decreases in our private equity holdings our mutual fund investment holdings at
december 31 2002 include an aggregate net gain before income taxes of 113
million that is included in stockholders equity as part of accumulated other
comprehensive income this net gain has not been recognized in our statements of
income and comprises aggregate gains of 155 million and aggregate losses of
42 million that have arisen since june 30 2002 and are considered temporary
interest expense on our debt is down more than 9 million due to lower principal
balances and interest rates in 2002 overall we recognized a net nonoperating
loss of 109 million in 2002 versus net nonoperating income of 194 million
in 2001

the 2002 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is lower
than that of 2001 due primarily to eliminating the amortization of nondeductible
goodwill in 2002

2001 versus 2000 the presentation of our results of operations in our
consolidated statements of income for 2001 and 2000 has been changed to conform
to our 2002 presentation the following narrative has been modified from that
presented in our 2001 annual report to provide a discussion that can be read in
conjunction with the new presentation in our consolidated income statement

net income decreased 732 million or 27 to 196 million and diluted
earnings per share fell from 208 to 152 a full years amortization of
goodwill arising from the t rowe price international acquisition accounted for
13 of the decline total revenues declined 14 from 115 billion to just
under 1 billion net revenues also declined 14 to 995 million

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds
decreased 101 million as average fund assets under management were 987
billion during 2001 152 billion less than in 2000 weakness in financial
market valuations that began in 2000 continued through 2001 the terrorist
attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 pushed financial markets down
to their lowest levels of the year before they recovered somewhat in the fourth
quarter mutual fund assets ended the year at 980 billion down 750 million
from the 2001 average and 83 billion from the start of 2001


                                    page 15
page


the science  technology fund and the international funds accounted for 41
billion and 34 billion respectively of the 86 billion net decline in
mutual fund valuations during 2001 dividends paid by the mutual funds net of
reinvestments were 2 billion in 2001 net inflows from fund investors were
5 billion in 2001 domestic stock funds had net investor subscriptions of more
than 18 billion while money market and bond fund investors added almost 7
billion two us growth funds led the inflows with the smallcap stock and blue
chip growth funds adding a total of 14 billion from investors international
stock funds had net outflows of 20 billion

assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage fell 21 billion
during 2001 and our advisory fees thereon were down 304 million while the
same financial market declines played a significant role in reducing these
assets cash inflows primarily from thirdparty distribution efforts and
international initiatives added about 29 billion to assets under management
in 2001 additionally adverse market conditions pushed performancerelated
advisory fees down 103 million in 2001

administrative revenues and other income were down 175 million from 2000
discount brokerage commissions fell 100 million from the prior year as
investor trading activity and average commission rates were lower other
administrative revenues declined 75 million but were mostly offset by reduced
costs of the services that we provide to the mutual funds and defined
contribution retirement plans

our savings bank subsidiarys customer deposits increased in 2001 and added 11
million to total revenues and 3 million to net revenues versus 2000

operating expenses declined about 8 from 744 million in 2000 to 684 million
in 2001 compensation and related costs is our largest expense and was up only
1 or 43 million from 2000 our average staff size was up about 2 versus 2000
but total compensation levels including bonus expense and the use of temporary
personnel by our information technology operations were down in 2001 staff
reductions primarily in november 2001 together with attrition during the year
reduced our staff to 3650 associates at december 31 2001 a 9 reduction from
the end of 2000 our advertising and promotion expense decreased almost 27 or
236 million to 646 million in 2001 as we curtailed these expenditures due to
weak financial market conditions that made investors more cautious and less
active

international investment research fees were eliminated in august 2000 at the
time of the t rowe price international acquisition depreciation and
amortization of property and equipment was 98 million higher in 2001 due
primarily to additional amortization from recently completed software and
technology projects as well as depreciation of new operating facilities we
completed our move into new space in london in the first quarter of 2001 and in
colorado springs in the fourth quarter of 2000 occupancy and facility costs are
down from 2000 as the temporary facilities and other additional costs associated
with the moves were eliminated

a full years amortization of goodwill arising from the t rowe price
international acquisition added 170 million to our 2001 expenses other
operating expenses decreased 25 or 291 million from 2000 as the
international transition and several technology initiatives have been brought to
a close we have substantially reduced other operating expenses


                                    page 16
page

overall net operating income was down 98 million from 2000 to 2001 including
the additional 17 million of goodwill expense

net nonoperating income was also down more than 29 million from 2000 net
investment income declined 272 million to 310 million with smaller cash and
mutual fund holdings as well as lower interest rates in 2001 accounting for the
decline gains from our venture capital investments in 2000 that did not recur
in 2001 were mostly offset by 113 million of greater realized gains from 2001
dispositions of our availableforsale mutual fund holdings interest expense on
our debt increased almost 22 million as our acquisition indebtedness was
outstanding for only five months in 2000

the 2001 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher
than that of 2000 largely due to the full years amortization of nondeductible
goodwill

minority interests declined due to the 2000 acquisition and the elimination of
the interests in a remaining venture in the first quarter of 2001

capital resources and liquidity

during the three years ended december 31 2002 stockholders equity increased
from 770 million to more than 11 billion stockholders equity at december
31 2002 includes 86 million of unrealized investment holding gains after
provision for income taxes and 42 million which is restricted as to use under
various regulations and agreements arising in the ordinary course of business
net liquid assets of more than 175 million are available at the beginning of
2003 unused committed credit facilities at the beginning of 2003 include 458
million expiring in june 2005 and 100 million expiring in june 2003

during 2002 we repaid 49 million of our debt and expended 96 million in the
repurchase of our common shares these cash outflows were funded by existing
cash balances proceeds of 25 million from exercises of our stock options and
cash provided by our operating activities

operating activities provided cash flows of 269 million in 2002 as compared to
290 million in 2001 net cash expended in investing activities increased 86
million from 2001 to 95 million in 2002 in 2001 we made net redemptions of our
sponsored mutual fund holdings of 53 million versus net investments of 10
million in 2002 investments in property and equipment in 2002 were down 15
million versus 2001 while our savings bank subsidiary increased its investment
portfolio more than 60 million as a result of increasing its customer deposits
cash used in financing activities was down about 140 million in 2002 versus
2001 bank borrowings were reduced 49 million in 2002 versus 205 million in
2001 with our debt having been substantially reduced we used our cash flows to
step up our share repurchase activity and on a net basis after increased option
exercises expended nearly 53 million more for share repurchases in 2002

anticipated property and equipment expenditures in 2003 are approximately 36
million these capital expenditures further debt reductions and additional
share repurchases are expected to be funded from existing cash balances and 2003
operating cash flows

under the terms of existing operating leases we are contractually obliged to
make certain future lease payments these aggregate commitments are discussed in
note 8 to our financial statements included elsewhere in this

2002 annual report and include 192 million in 2003 146 million in 2004
288 million in 2005  2007 and 471 million thereafter we have historically

and expect to continue to do so in the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies

the preparation of financial statements often requires the selection of specific
accounting methods and policies from among several acceptable alternatives
further significant estimates and judgments may be required in selecting and
applying those methods and policies in the recognition of the assets and
liabilities in our balance sheet the revenues and expenses in our statement of
income and the information that is contained in our significant accounting
policies and notes to the financial statements making these estimates and
judgments requires the analysis of information concerning events that may not
yet be complete and of facts and circumstances that may change over time
accordingly actual amounts or future results could differ materially from those
estimates that we include currently in our financial statements and notes
thereto

we have historically presented those significant accounting policies that we use
in the preparation of our financial statements as an integral part of those
statements and have done so again in this 2002 annual report in the following
discussion we highlight and explain further certain of those policies that are
most critical to the preparation and understanding of our financial statements
the application of these policies often requires significant judgments and
estimates

other than temporary impairments of available for sale securities we classify
our investment holdings in sponsored mutual funds and the debt securities held
in the investment portfolio of our savings bank subsidiary as available for
sale at the end of each quarter we mark the carrying amount of each investment
holding to fair value and recognize an unrealized gain or loss in other
comprehensive income within stockholders equity we next review each individual
security position that has an unrealized loss to determine if that loss is other
than temporary

a mutual fund holding that has had an unrealized loss for more than six months
is presumed to have an other than temporary loss and an impairment is recognized
in our statement of income unless there is persuasive evidence such as an
increase in value subsequent to quarter end to overcome that presumption we
may also recognize an other than temporary loss of less than six months in our
statement of income if the particular circumstances of the underlying investment
do not warrant our belief that a nearterm recovery is possible a debt security
held by our savings bank subsidiary is considered impaired and an other than
temporary loss is recognized whenever we determine that we will probably not
collect all contractual amounts due under the terms of the security based on the
issuers financial condition and our intent to hold that security

goodwill as a result of the adoption of a new financial accounting standard on
january 1 2002 we ceased recording recurring charges to amortize the carrying
amount of goodwill in our balance sheet the new standard instead now requires
that we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis using a
fair value approach we make that evaluation in the third quarter of each year
goodwill is considered impaired whenever the carrying amount of the related
reporting unit exceeds


                                    page 18
page


the fair value of that unit we attribute all goodwill to our single reportable
business segment and reporting unit our investment advisory business

because our testing in 2002 demonstrated that the fair value of our investment
advisory business exceeded our carrying amount basically our stockholders
equity we concluded that no impairment exists should we reach a different
conclusion when we conduct our evaluation in subsequent years additional work
would be performed to ascertain the amount of the noncash charge needed to
recognize the impairment we must also perform impairment testing at other times
if an event or circumstance occurs indicating that it is more likely than not
that an impairment has been incurred the maximum possible future impairment
charge that we could incur is the amount recognized in our balance sheet 666
million at december 31 2002

provision for income taxes after compensation and related costs our provision
for income taxes on our earnings is our second largest annual expense we
operate in several states and several other countries through our various
subsidiaries and must allocate income expenses and earnings under the various
laws and regulations of each of these taxing jurisdictions accordingly our
provision for income taxes represents our total estimate of the liability that
we have incurred for doing business in all locations annually we file tax
returns which represent our filing positions with each jurisdiction and settle
our return liabilities each jurisdiction has the right to audit those returns
and may take different positions with respect to income and expense allocations
and taxable earnings determinations from timetotime we may also provide for
estimated liabilities associated with uncertain tax return filing positions that
are subject to or in the process of being audited by various tax authorities
because the determinations of our annual provisions are subject to judgments and
estimates it is possible that actual results will vary from those recognized in
our financial statements in such cases it is possible that additional expense
for prior reporting periods may be recorded in subsequent periods as actual tax
returns and tax audits are settled

stock options the summary of significant accounting policies includes certain
pro forma disclosures as if a fair value based method had been used to recognize
compensation expense associated with our stock option grants the fair value
method uses a valuation model for shorterterm markettraded financial
instruments to theoretically value our stock option grants even though they are
not available for trading purposes and are of longer duration the model
includes the input of certain variables that are dependent on future
expectations including the expected lives of our options from grant date to
exercise date the volatility of our underlying common shares in the market over
that time period and the rate of dividends that we will pay during that time
additionally the recognition of expense fluctuates based on the forfeiture rate
for unvested options when employees leave the company

our estimates for the variables used in the valuation model are made for the
purpose of theoretically determining an expense for each reporting period and
are not subsequently adjusted unlike almost all other expenses the resulting
theoretical charge to earnings using a fair value based method is a noncash
charge that is never measured by a cash outflow

newly issued accounting pronouncement

on january 17 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an
interpretation of accounting principles that have existed since 1959 in its
interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities the fasb
defines a variable interest entity as a corporation partnership limited
liability company trust or any other legal structure used for business
purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or
b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for
the entity to support its activities the interpretation requires a variable
interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to
among other things a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest
entitys residual returns a company that is required to consolidate a variable
interest entity is referred to as the primary beneficiary of that entity

we are presently reviewing the accounting requirements of this interpretation to
determine its applicability to our consolidated financial statements while our
review is not complete at this time we have initially determined that we hold
residual interests in two 300 million highyield collateralized bond
obligations cbos for which we may be required to apply the provisions of this
interpretation beginning july 1 2003 these entities are nonrecourse limited
liability companies in which we hold a portion though not a majority of the
interests in their residual returns we are also the collateral manager of each
cbo and receive a marketbased fee for performance of that service we may also
receive a marketbased performance fee though none were recognized in 2002

our maximum exposure to future losses from these interests is the 10 million
carrying amount in other assets at december 31 2002

outflows in the t rowe price mutual funds and other managed investment
portfolios fluctuations in the financial markets around the world that result
in appreciation or depreciation of the assets under our management the relative

advisoryrelated administrative services provided to the funds and their
shareholders changes in retirement savings trends favoring participantdirected
investments and defined contribution plans the amount and timing of income or
loss from our private equity high yield mutual fund and other investments
and our level of success in implementing our strategy to expand our business
internationally our revenues are substantially dependent on fees earned under
contracts with the price funds and could be adversely affected if the
independent directors of one or more of the price funds determined to terminate
or significantly alter the terms of the investment management or related
administrative services agreements

our future results are also dependent upon the level of our expenses which are
subject to fluctuation for the following or other reasons changes in the level
of our advertising expenses in response to market conditions including our
efforts to expand our investment advisory business to investors outside the
united states and to further penetrate our distribution channels within the
united states variations in the level of total compensation expense due to
among other things bonuses changes in our employee count and mix and
competitive factors any goodwill impairment that may arise fluctuation in
foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the costs of our international
operations and our yendenominated debt expenses and capital costs such as
technology assets depreciation amortization and research and development
incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services
infrastructure unanticipated costs that may be incurred to protect investor
accounts and the goodwill of our clients and disruptions of services including
those provided by third parties such as facilities communications power and
the mutual fund transfer agent system

our business is also subject to substantial governmental regulation and changes
in legal regulatory accounting tax and compliance requirements may have a
substantial effect on our operations and results including but not limited to
effects on costs that we incur and effects on investor interest in mutual funds
and investing in general or in particular classes of mutual funds or other
investments



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our
management accordingly declines in financial market values directly and
negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income

we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive
financial instruments held for purposes other than trading we do not invest in
derivative financial or commodity instruments mutual fund investments have
inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential
future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the
mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to
market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates


                                    page 21
page


the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk
from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in
the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value
before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund
investments at year end using each funds lowest fair value per share during the
past year in considering this presentation it is important to note that all
funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day it
is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be
changed if adverse market conditions persist and we could experience future
losses in excess of those presented below



                    fair value at                            potential

stock funds            72929                 59              63799            60              9130     13

the comparable potential loss of value shown in last years annual report was
157 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 1232 million at the end
of 2001 during 2002 we actually experienced net unrealized losses of 102
million in the value of our fund investments

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by
their nature invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe
price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its
investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment
holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market
risks and other factors as deemed appropriate by management

interest rates on our outstanding debt under the credit facility expiring in
june 2005 are reset at one to sixmonth intervals our borrowing rate on this
debt is presently only 176 should our cost of funds increase back to the 71
that we experienced in early 2001 and we make no repayments of principal on the
existing outstanding balance of 42 million our interest expense for a full
year would increase by 22 million

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank
subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the
change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would not be material

the us dollar weakened versus the japanese yen again in 2002 and an exchange
rate loss was recognized on our yen borrowing in evaluating exchange rate
sensitivity a loss of 13 million would be recognized if the yen strengthened
10 from december 31 2002 other foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities are not material

we also make other investments that we include in our balance sheet in other
assets we are at risk for further losses on these investments should market
conditions deteriorate as they have in the past three years at december 31
2002 we hold investments in a sponsored highyield collateralized bond
obligation issued in 2001 that is recognized in our balance sheet at 10 million
and in private equity and other entities totaling nearly 7 million during
2002 we recognized nearly 64 million of losses on these investments and
similar ones that we previously held


                                    page 22
page


our risk of future loss on these investments cannot exceed the 17 million
recognized in our balance sheet additionally we have recognized our 10
interest in daiwa sb investments japan at 15 million using the cost basis of
accounting our market risk on this investment is primarily limited to foreign
currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the japanese yen
because the functional currency of daiwa sb investments is the yen

item 1  business

overview t rowe price group is a financial services holding company that
derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from investment
advisory services that its subsidiaries provide to individual and institutional
investors in the sponsored t rowe price mutual funds and other investment
portfolios our investment advisory revenues depend largely on the total value
and composition of assets under our management accordingly fluctuations in
financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our
revenues and results of operations

we operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies
primarily t rowe price associates and t rowe price international our advisory
business was begun by the late thomas rowe price in 1937 and our common stock
was offered to the public for the first time in 1986 our corporate holding
company structure was put in place on december 28 2000

total assets under our management decreased 104 billion from the beginning of
2001 to end the year at 1563 billion including 1026 billion held in
retirement accounts and variable annuity investment portfolios assets under our
management at the end of 2001 included 897 billion of us domestic equity
securities 421 billion of debt securities and 245 billion of international
securities the five largest price funds at december 31 2001  equity income
midcap growth blue chip growth international stock and prime reserve 
account for 232 of assets under management at that time and 276 of 2001
investment advisory revenues the investors that we serve are primarily
domiciled in the united states of america

our assets under management are accumulated from a diversified client base that
is accessed across several distribution methods our assets under management are
sourced approximately 30 from individual us investors 30 from us defined
contribution retirement plans 20 from thirdparty distribution and 20 from
institutional investors our international client base presently accounts for
less than 2 of our assets under management and is included primarily in our
thirdparty distribution and institutional investor assets our largest client
account relationship other than several of the t rowe price funds accounted for
less than 4 of our investment advisory revenues in 2001

we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock bond and
money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which are designed to
meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of individual and
institutional investors as an example mutual fund shareholders can exchange
balances among mutual funds as economic and market conditions and their
investment needs change from time to time we introduce new funds and other
investment portfolios to complement and expand our investment offerings respond
to competitive developments in the financial marketplace and meet the changing
needs of our investment advisory clients we will open a new mutual fund if we
believe that its objective can be useful for


                                       2

investors over a long period of time

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our
investment advisory clients these administrative services are provided by
several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent
accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer
agent services for defined contribution retirement plans discount brokerage
and trust services more than 90 of our administrative revenues in 2001 were
based on the recovery of expenditures incurred in providing the related services
and they therefore do not significantly affect our net income

we employ fundamental and quantitative security analyses in the performance of
the investment advisory function we maintain substantial internal domestic and
international equity and fixed income investment research capabilities we
perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection
of corporate activities management interviews companypublished financial and
other information financial newspapers and magazines corporate rating
services and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry
and particular business sector our research staff operates from offices located
in the united states and six foreign countries great britain argentina
france hong kong japan and singapore we also use research provided by
brokerage firms in a supportive capacity and information received from private
economists political observers commentators government experts and market
and security analysts our stock selection process for some investment
portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data modeling

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the price
funds accommodate a variety of strategies investors select funds based on the
distinct objectives that are detailed in each funds prospectus management of
other client portfolios includes approaches similar to those employed in the
price funds equity investment strategies may emphasize largecap midcap or
smallcap investing growth or value investing and us global or
international investing we also offer systematic taxefficient and blended
equity investment strategies as well as active and systematic management
strategies for fixed income investments our specialized advisory services
include investing in stable value asset contracts and a service for the
efficient disposition of equity distributions from venture capital investments

information concerning our revenues results of operations and assets under
management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated
statements of income and in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements
included in item 8 of this form 10k

recent developments financial markets both in the us and internationally
were again difficult in 2001 the second consecutive year of declines that
pushed our assets under management lower during the year stock market
valuations languished during the year and were driven down sharply after the
september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states though some fourth

quarter recovery followed the us economy slipped into a recession in march
and the federal reserve lowered shortterm interest rates throughout the year in
an effort to boost economic prospects

investor sentiment was not favorable in this environment and our investment
portfolios experienced net market declines of 138 billion or 83 of yearend
2000 assets under management mutual fund investors contributed positive net
cash inflows of 514 million client activity from third party distribution
efforts and institutional investors including our european initiatives
however produced strong net cash inflows of 29 billion into other investment
portfolios during 2001

while our mutual fund cash flows overall were only slightly positive in 2001
fund investor activity varied across the range of our offerings domestic stock
funds added 18 billion including 14 billion almost evenly split between the
smallcap stock and blue chip growth funds bond and money market funds added
nearly 7 billion as investors only modestly shifted their assets to fixed
income investments international stock funds however had net outflows of 20
billion during 2001

we reached a significant financial milestone in 2001 as our stockholders equity
surpassed 1 billion for the first time lower assets under management adversely
affected our 2001 revenues and net income versus the levels of 1999 and 2000
lower investment income also contributed to the decline in net income cash
flows from operations were still strong enabling us to repurchase nearly 11
million outstanding common shares and to reduce our acquisition indebtedness by
205 million we worked hard in this environment to cut expenses and over the
course of 2001 reduced headcount by more than 9 and operating expenses by more
than 7 our aim was to adjust these levels to more realistic business realities
while still sustaining our high client service standards

enabled by our 2000 acquisition of the 50 noncontrolling interest in t rowe
price international from robert fleming holdings we now compete for the
provision of investment advisory services to institutional and individual
investors outside the united states in january 2001 our new uk investment
advisory subsidiary t rowe price global investment services received
regulatory approvals for the expansion of our investment advisory business to
europe our marketing efforts now include the offering of separate account
management to institutional investors in europe and a series of
luxembourgdomiciled mutual funds with both institutional and individual share
classes initial efforts have focused on institutional investors whereas
individual investors will be sought through third party distributors of the
luxembourg funds our efforts in europe complement those that we initiated in
japan in 1999 through t rowe price global asset management which subadvises
investment assets for daiwa sb investments together our international client
base now accounts for more than 1 of our total assets under management

beginning in the second quarter of 2000 we undertook significant efforts and
expenditures to establish our foreign offices in independent facilities with

full access to the t rowe price global technology network and investment
portfolio systems we completed these transition efforts by the end of the
second quarter of 2001

in the united states we introduced section 529 college savings investment plans
in conjunction with alaska and maryland these plans include flexible investment
options and tax advantages for investors in saving for future college education
costs

price funds we provide investment advisory distribution and other
administrative services to the price funds under various agreements investment
advisory services are provided to each fund under individual investment
management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t rowe price
name the boards of the respective funds including a majority of directors who
are not interested persons of the funds or of us as defined in the investment
company act of 1940 as amended must approve the investment management
agreements annually amendments to management agreements must be approved by
fund shareholders each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its
assignment as defined in the investment company act and generally either
party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60day notice the
termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse
effect on our results of operations

advisory services investment advisory revenues are based upon the daily net
assets managed in each fund additional fees are earned for advisoryrelated
administrative services as discussed below independent directors and trustees
of the price funds regularly review our fee structures

the advisory fee paid by each of the price funds generally is computed each day
by multiplying a funds net assets by a specific fee for the majority of the
price funds the fee is equal to the sum of a group charge that is set based on
the combined net assets of those funds and an individual fund charge that is set
based on the funds specific investment objective the 2001 fee rates by fund
varied from a low of 32 basis points for the us treasury money fund to a high
of 107 basis points for the latin america and international discovery funds as
the combined net assets of the funds increase the group charge component of the
fee and the overall fund fee decreases details of each funds fee arrangement
are available in its prospectus

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been
developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection of
investing opportunities all price funds are sold exclusively on a noload
basis without a sales commission noload mutual funds offer investors a
lowcost and relatively easy method of investing in a variety of stock and bond
portfolios our advisor class of fund shares is sold through financial
intermediaries and incurs a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points for distribution and
recordkeeping we believe that our lower fund cost structure distribution
methods and fund shareholder and administrative services promote stability of
fund assets through market cycles

the issuance and redemption of its securities in particular each fund pays

accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and expenses

prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders registration fees

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
of operations

general

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory
services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our
sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios

we manage a broad range of us domestic and international stock bond and


                                       14
page


money market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied
needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors investment
advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets
under management accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the
composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of
operations total assets under our management were 1563 billion at december
31 2001 including 1142 billion in equity securities and 421 billion in
fixedincome investments this reflects a 104 billion or 6 decrease from
the 1667 billion that we managed at the end of 2000

acquisition

on august 8 2000 we purchased robert fleming holdings 50 interest in our
consolidated subsidiary t rowe price international which at that time managed
375 billion this purchase transaction resulted in goodwill of 704 million
coincident with the change in ownership our international investment research
contracts with robert fleming affiliates were terminated during the period
through june 30 2001 we incurred substantial costs to establish and transition
to the new operating infrastructure for our international investment operations
robert fleming affiliates previously provided the space and infrastructure for
this subsidiarys international offices

international expansion

through our new subsidiary t rowe price global investment services we
expanded our marketing efforts in 2001 to european investors a move which
complements our efforts in japan that began in 1999 through the daiwa sb
investments venture and our subsidiary t rowe price global asset management
investors outside the united states now account for more than 1 of our assets
under management our expenditures to broaden our investor base may be
significant and will precede revenues from any new investment advisory clients
that we may obtain

results of operations

2001 versus 2000 net income decreased 732 million or 27 to 196 million
and diluted earnings per share fell from 208 to 152 a full years
amortization of goodwill arising from the t rowe price international
acquisition accounted for 13 of the decline total revenues declined 15 from
12 billion to just over 10 billion

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds
decreased 101 million as average fund assets under management were 987
billion during 2001 152 billion less than in 2000 weakness in financial
market valuations that began in 2000 continued through 2001 the terrorist
attacks in the united states on september 11 2001 pushed financial markets down
to their lowest levels of the year before they recovered somewhat in the fourth
quarter mutual fund assets ended the year at 980 billion down 750 million
from the 2001 average and 83 billion from the start of 2001


                                       15
page



the science  technology fund and the international funds accounted for 41
billion and 34 billion respectively of the 86 billion net decline in
mutual fund valuations during 2001 dividends paid by the mutual funds net of
reinvestments were 2 billion in 2001 net inflows from fund investors were
5 billion in 2001 domestic stock funds had net investor subscriptions of more
than 18 billion while money market and bond fund investors added almost 7
billion two us growth funds led the inflows with the smallcap stock and blue
chip growth funds adding a total of 14 billion from investors international
stock funds had net outflows of 20 billion

assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage fell 21 billion
during 2001 and our advisory fees thereon were down 304 million while the
same financial market declines played a significant role in reducing these
assets cash inflows primarily from thirdparty distribution efforts and
international initiatives added about 29 billion to assets under management
in 2001 additionally adverse market conditions pushed performancerelated
advisory fees down 103 million in 2001 we earn these fees primarily from a
managed disposition service for distributions of venture capital investments
and though recurring these fees vary significantly as market conditions and
investment portfolios change

administrative revenues were down 172 million from 2000 discount brokerage
commissions fell 100 million from the prior year as investor trading activity
and average commission rates were lower other administrative revenues declined
72 million but were mostly offset by lower costs of the services that we
provide to the mutual funds and defined contribution retirement plans

investment income declined 263 million to 328 million with smaller cash and
mutual fund holdings as well as lower interest rates in 2001 accounting for the
decline gains from our venture capital investments in 2000 that did not recur
in 2001 were mostly offset by 113 million of greater realized gains from 2001
dispositions of our availableforsale mutual fund holdings we expect that
investment income in the first half of 2002 will generally be lower than that of
the comparable 2001 period

operating expenses declined about 8 from 754 million in 2000 to 697 million
in 2001 compensation and related costs is our largest expense and was up only
1 or 43 million from 2000 our average staff size was up about 2 versus 2000
but performancebased bonus expense and the use of temporary personnel by our
information technology operations were down in 2001 staff reductions primarily
in november 2001 together with attrition during the year reduced our staff to
3650 associates at december 31 2001 a 9 reduction from the end of 2000 our
advertising and promotion expense decreased almost 27 or 236 million to 646
million in 2001 as we curtailed these expenditures due to weak financial market
conditions that have made investors more cautious and less active we vary our
spending based on market conditions and investor demand as well as our efforts
to expand our investor base in the united states and internationally we expect
our advertising and promotion expenditures in the first half of 2002 to be


                                       16
page



less than in the comparable 2001 period market conditions in the second half of
the year will dictate our spending then

international investment research fees were eliminated in august 2000 at the
time of the t rowe price international acquisition occupancy and equipment
expense was 78 million higher in 2001 due primarily to additional amortization
from recently completed software and technology projects as well as the
expansion of our operating facilities into new space in london in the first
quarter of 2001 and in colorado springs in the fourth quarter of 2000 for the
first time in several years no facilities expansion is currently underway the
next planned move will occur in late third quarter 2002 when our tampa service
center relocates to a new leased facility

a full years amortization of goodwill arising from the t rowe price
international acquisition and interest expense on our related indebtedness added
170 million and 30 million respectively to our 2001 expenses as a result
of the issuance and adoption of new financial accounting standards we will
cease recording a recurring charge amortizing goodwill after 2001 and will
evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill in our balance sheet for impairment on
an annual basis using a fair value approach we must adopt the new accounting
standards on january 1 2002 and complete certain transitional testing of the
goodwill carrying amount as of that date in order to perform this testing we
must first identify our reporting units for purposes of assigning goodwill among
them as of the beginning of 2002 we then have until june 30 2002 to complete a
comparison of the fair values of our reporting units with goodwill to the
carrying amounts of those reporting units as of january 1 2002 if the fair
values of the reporting units are at least equal to the carrying amounts of
those units then no indication of goodwill impairment exists and our adoption
of the new accounting standard is complete while we have not completed the
prescribed transitional testing at this time we do not believe that we will
recognize any impairment loss as the result of adopting the new accounting
standards

other operating expenses decreased 25 or 291 million from 2000 as the
international transition and several technology initiatives have been brought to
a close we have substantially reduced other operating expenses

the 2001 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher
than that of 2000 largely due to the full years amortization of nondeductible
goodwill the effective tax rate will decrease in 2002 when the goodwill
amortization ceases

minority interests declined due to the 2000 acquisition and the elimination of
the interests in a remaining venture in the first quarter of 2001

2000 versus 1999 net income increased nearly 30 million or 12 to 269 million
and diluted earnings per share rose from 185 to 208 total revenues
increased 17 from 1 billion to a record 12 billion led by an increase of
115 million in investment advisory fees

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds


                                       17

increased 86 million as average fund assets under management were 1139
billion during 2000 131 billion more than in 1999 however declines in
financial market valuations pushed fund assets down 55 billion during the
year net redemptions by fund investors were 17 billion during 2000 defined
contribution plans moved 2 billion to other advisers on the last day of the
year offsetting net inflows that had occurred until that time the merger of a
client into another firm and the restructuring of investments by a large state
pension plan were the primary causes of the outflows at yearend 2000 other
fund asset decreases were the result of our redemption of almost 5 billion to
partially fund the t rowe price international acquisition and 5 billion of
dividends net of reinvestments that were paid out during 2000 mutual fund
assets ended 2000 at 1063 billion including 843 billion in stock funds

assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage were also higher during
most of 2000 and contributed 25 million of additional advisory fees in
addition performancerelated advisory fees earned primarily on venture capital
investments that we manage were 4 million higher in 2000 assets in other
portfolios that we manage ended 2000 at 604 billion down from 654 billion
at the beginning of the year due primarily to international portfolios which
experienced both market depreciation of 33 billion and outflows of 15
billion during 2000

administrative fees from advisoryrelated services that we provide to the funds
and their shareholders rose 396 million from 1999 to 2369 million this
increase is primarily attributable to transfer agency and recordkeeping services
for defined contribution retirement plans and the price mutual funds and
includes 11 million of 12b1 distribution fees received from the new advisor
class of mutual fund shares administrative revenues are largely offset by the
costs that we incur in providing the services including fees paid to third
parties which distribute the advisor shares to their clients discount brokerage
added 14 million of the increase on greater transaction volume offset by lower
average commissions arising from the shift to transactions originating over the
internet

investment and other income rose more than 21 million from 1999 to 59 million
net gains of 74 million on dispositions of our stock and bond mutual fund
holdings in 2000 versus losses of 16 million recognized on fund holdings in
1999 account for 90 million of the increase higher returns on our venture
capital investments added 29 million in 2000 the strong markets of late 1999
and early 2000 produced significant market gains and distributions from venture
capital investments larger capital gain distributions resulting from our stock
fund holdings added 20 million to our 2000 income foreign currency rate
fluctuations arising from our yendenominated debt account for a positive change
of 46 million as the losses experienced in 1999 largely reversed in 2000

operating expenses increased 21 to 754 million greater compensation and
related costs which were up 51 million or 16 were attributable to increases
in our rates of compensation including performancerelated bonuses and an 8
increase in our staff size primarily to support our


                                       18

growing operations as of december 31 2000 we employed more than 4000
associates our advertising and promotion expenditures increased 141 million
from 1999 to 882 million

international investment research fees were down 17 million from 1999 as the
contract for these services terminated at the time of the t rowe price
international acquisition occupancy and equipment expense was 161 million
higher in 2000 due primarily to the expansion of our operating facilities in
owings mills in late 1999 and early 2000 amortization of goodwill arising from
the t rowe price international purchase and interest expense on our acquisition
indebtedness added 111 million and 93 million respectively to our 2000
expenses other operating expenses increased 47 million largely due to
significant broadbased technology expenditures that support established and new
business activities additional expenses in connection with our international
expansion also contributed to the higher expense levels costs incurred for
defined contribution plan recordkeeping systems and the distribution of the
advisor class of fund shares also increased our expense levels however these
charges were generally offset by additional administrative revenues

the 2000 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is higher
than that of 1999 largely due to the new goodwill charges that are not
deductible in determining our income tax expense

minority interests declined 59 million due to the acquisition of robert
flemings 50 interest in t rowe price international

capital resources and liquidity

during the three years ended december 31 2001 stockholders equity increased
from 614 million to nearly 11 billion stockholders equity at december 31
2001 includes 12 million of unrealized investment holding gains after
provision for income taxes and 34 million which is restricted as to use under
various regulations and agreements arising in the ordinary course of business
net liquid assets of about 103 million were available at the beginning of 2002
unused committed credit facilities at the beginning of 2002 include 410 million
expiring in june 2005 and 100 million expiring in june 2002

operating activities provided cash flows of 290 million in 2001 as net income
decreased from the prior year comparatively 2000 provided net operating cash
inflows of 323 million net cash expended in investing activities decreased
852 million from 2000 to only 9 million this significant decline is
attributable to the use of 783 million for the 2000 acquisition and the use of
mutual fund proceeds to fund investments and capital expenditures in 2001 cash
used in financing activities was 282 million in 2001 this compares with cash
provided by financing activities of 260 million in 2000 net bank borrowings
used to partially fund the acquisition provided cash of 295 million in 2000
whereas we repaid 205 million of those borrowings in 2001 there were no
repurchases of common stock in 2000 compared with 31 million used to repurchase
shares in 2001


                                       19

dividends paid to common stockholders were 74 million 11 million higher than
2000 as the pershare dividend was increased

anticipated property and equipment acquisitions in 2002 are approximately 30
million these capital expenditures and further debt reductions are expected to
be funded from operating cash inflows in 2002

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

our revenues and net income are based primarily on the value of assets under our
management accordingly declines of financial market values directly and
negatively impact our investment advisory revenues and net income

we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive
financial instruments held for purposes other than trading we do not invest in
derivative financial or commodity instruments mutual fund investments have
inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the potential
future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the
mutual fund shares each fund and its underlying net assets are also subject to
market risk which may arise from changes in equity prices credit ratings
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk
from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline in
the fair values of mutual fund shares this potential future loss of value
before any income tax benefits reflects the valuation of mutual fund
investments at year end using each funds lowest fair value per share during the
prior twelve months in considering this presentation it is important to note
that all funds did not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same
day it is likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio
would be changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience
future losses in excess of those presented below

the comparable potential loss of value shown in last years annual report was
17 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 190 million at the end of
2000 during 2001 we had net unrealized losses of 14 million in the value of
our fund investments

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by
their nature invest in a number of different financial instruments t rowe
price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its
investments among many domestic and international funds in addition investment
holdings may be altered from time to time in response to changes in market
risks and other factors as deemed appropriate by management

interest rates on our outstanding debt under the credit facility expiring in
june 2005 are reset at one to sixmonth intervals our borrowing rate on this
debt decreased from 64 on january 8 2001 to 218 on january 14 2002 as the
us federal reserve bank cut shortterm interest rates throughout 2001 should
our cost of funds increase back to the 64 that we experienced about 12 months
ago and we make no repayments of principal on the existing outstanding balance
of 90 million our interest expense for a full year would increase by 38
million

the investment portfolio and customer deposit liabilities of our savings bank
subsidiary are subject to interest rate risk if interest rates change 1 the
change in the net value of these assets and liabilities would decrease about
250000

the us dollar strengthened against the japanese yen again in 2001 and an
exchange rate gain was recognized on our yen borrowing in evaluating exchange
rate sensitivity a loss of 14 million would be recognized if the yen
strengthened 10 from december 31 2001 other foreign currency denominated
assets and liabilities are not material

item 1  business

overview  t rowe price group is a financial services holding company formed
in 2000 that derives its consolidated revenues and net income primarily from
investment advisory services that certain of its subsidiaries provide to
individual and institutional investors in the t rowe price mutual funds and
other investment portfolios  the investors that we serve are primarily
domiciled in the united states

on june 30 2000 the stockholders of t rowe price associates approved the
oneforone exchange of their shares for those of t rowe price group  the
share exchange occurred on december 28 2000 at which time t rowe price
group became the sole owner of t rowe price associates and t rowe price
associates former stockholders became the stockholders of t rowe price
group  the exchange was accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar
to a poolingofinterests transaction and t rowe price group succeeded to t
rowe price associates obligation for periodic public reporting

we operate our investment advisory business through our subsidiary companies
primarily t rowe price associates and t rowe price international formerly
rowe pricefleming international  our advisory business is the successor to
the investment counseling business begun by the late thomas rowe price in
1937  our common stock was offered to the public for the first time in 1986

total assets under our management decreased 132 billion from the beginning
of 2000 to end the year at 1667 billion  these assets include 1052
billion of investments held in retirement accounts and variable annuity
investment portfolios  investments in equity securities were 1266 billion
at the end of 2000 including 318 billion in international securities  the
three largest price funds  equity income international stock and science 
technology  accounted for 25 of investment advisory revenues in 2000 and
18 of assets under management at yearend 2000

we offer a broad range of investment portfolios designed to attract and
retain investors with varying investment objectives  price fund shareholders
can exchange balances among mutual funds as economic and market conditions
and their investment needs change  from timetotime we introduce new
mutual funds and other investment portfolios to complement and expand our
investment offerings respond to competitive developments in the financial
marketplace and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients
we will open a new price fund only if we believe that it can play a useful
role for investors over a long period of time

we manage a broad range of domestic and international stock bond and money
market mutual funds and other investment portfolios that meet the varied
needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors  investment
advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets
under management  accordingly fluctuations in financial market valuations
and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and
page 3
results of operations

we also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our
investment advisory clients  these administrative services are provided by
several of our subsidiary companies and include mutual fund transfer agent
accounting and shareholder services participant recordkeeping and transfer
agent services for defined contribution retirement plans discount brokerage
and trust services  about 75 of our administrative revenues in 2000 were
from services to the price funds  fees earned for administrative services to
the price funds are generally based on the recovery of expenditures incurred
and they therefore do not significantly affect our net income

we employ fundamental technical and cyclical security analyses in the
performance of the investment advisory function  we maintain substantial
internal domestic and international equity and fixed income investment
research capabilities  we perform original industry and company research
using such sources as inspection of corporate activities management
interviews companypublished financial and other information financial
newspapers and magazines corporate rating services and field checks with
suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business
sector  our research staff operates from offices located in the united
states and six foreign countries  great britain argentina france hong
kong japan and singapore  we also use research provided by brokerage firms
in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists
political observers commentators government experts and market and
security analysts  our stock selection process for some investment
portfolios is based on quantitative analyses using computerized data
modeling

investment objectives for our managed investment portfolios including the
price funds accommodate a variety of strategies  investors select funds for
investment based on the distinct objectives that are detailed in each funds
prospectus  management of other stock portfolios includes active approaches
similar to those employed in the price funds  investment strategies for
these clients may emphasize largecap midcap or smallcap investing growth
or value investing and international or us investing  we also offer
systematic taxefficient and blended equity investment strategies as well
as several active and systematic management strategies for fixed income
investments  our specialized advisory services include investing in stable
value asset contracts and a service for the efficient disposition of equity
distributions from venture capital investments

information concerning our revenues results of operations and assets under
management during the past three years is contained in our consolidated
statements of income and in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements
included in item 8 of this form 10k

recent developments  we completed the most significant financial transaction
in our history on august 8 2000 when we acquired the 50 noncontrolling
interest in our consolidated subsidiary rowe pricefleming international
from londonbased asset management and investment banking group robert
page 4
fleming holdings for 783 million including 704 million of goodwill  to
finance the purchase of the fleming interest we used 483 million of our
cash holdings and borrowed 300 million under a fiveyear syndicated bank
credit facility  at the time of this transaction rowe pricefleming managed
375 billion of international assets which were historically included in our
reported consolidated assets under management  we formed rowe pricefleming
in 1979 with robert fleming in order to provide us investors with
international investment advisory services  as a result of the transaction
we can now compete for the provision of investment advisory services to
institutional and individual investors throughout the world  in late 2000
we began marketing efforts to expand our investor base to european
institutions  in addition we have undertaken significant efforts to
establish our foreign offices in facilities that are independent of robert
fleming  we expect that movement into these new international facilities
will be complete in the first half of 2001

we achieved several significant financial milestones in 2000  revenues
surpassed 12 billion for the first time while stockholders equity grew to
nearly 1 billion and ended 2000 at 991 million  net income and earnings
per share also reached respective records of 269 million and 208 diluted

financial markets were difficult in 2000  stock market valuations peaked in
the first quarter and declined sharply in the fourth quarter  investor
sentiment was not favorable in this environment and our investment offerings
experienced net cash outflows  for the first time in our fifteen years as a
public company our assets under management declined during the fiscal year

while cash flows overall were negative during 2000 investor sentiment
concentrated net cash inflows into a few of our mutual funds  strong 1999
and early 2000 market performance in the technology sector led investors to
put 26 billion into the science  technology fund while four other growth
oriented funds  midcap growth blue chip growth health sciences and new
horizons  added net investments totaling 24 billion  these positive net
cash flows were offset by the effect of negative investor sentiment for most
of the year toward valueoriented and international stock funds  our equity
income fund had net redemptions of 32 billion while the growth  income
equity index 500 and international stock funds had net outflows of 20
billion

seven new mutual funds were offered in 2000 including two for the
institutional market  our fund shareholders also approved the merger of four
smaller bond funds into three larger funds during the fourth quarter of the
year

performancerelated advisory fees earned from our other investment portfolios
were higher in 2000 and for the year totaled nearly 165 million though
only 2 million was recognized in the fourth quarter  in 2000 our
specialized service for the disposition of venture capital distributions
accounted for 154 million of these fees  the same favorable markets for
ipos and technology stocks of late 1999 and early 2000 that led to the net
cash inflows to our science  technology fund also produced additional assets
page 5
for and revenues from our disposition service in 2000  performancerelated
fees are also earned from investment partnerships that we sponsor  these
partnerships have entered their liquidation stage and contributed lower
performance fees in 2000 than in 1999  while performancebased revenues from
our disposition service and sponsored partnerships are of a recurring nature
their significance will vary as market conditions change and the partnerships
complete their liquidation  given the declining market conditions of late
2000 and early 2001 a lower level of revenues from these sources is likely
in 2001

in june 2000 we commenced operations of a new subsidiary the t rowe price
savings bank  through the savings bank we now issue federally insured
certificates of deposit

in june 2000 we also began offering an advisor class of shares with a 12b1
fee for ten of the price funds  these shares are available through certain
fullservice financial intermediaries and provide new distribution channels
for the price funds

during 2000 we also expanded our investor center network where our clients
can visit with our customer service representatives  a new center was opened
in the walnut creek area of greater san francisco  we plan to open a few
additional centers in 2001 continuing our effort to be available to a large
number of our investors within one hours drive  additionally we completed
the first building in our western campus in colorado springs and finished the
move into our expanded owings mills campus that we had begun in late 1999

price funds  we provide investment advisory distribution and other
administrative services to the price funds under various agreements
investment advisory services are provided to each fund under individual
investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the t
rowe price name  the boards of the respective funds including a majority of
directors who are not interested persons as defined in the investment
company act of 1940 as amended of the funds or of us must approve the
investment management agreements annually  amendments to management
agreements must be approved by fund shareholders  each agreement
automatically terminates in the event of its assignment as defined in the
investment company act and generally either party may terminate the
agreement without penalty after a 60day notice  the termination of one or
more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations

advisory services  investment advisory fees are based upon the average daily
net assets managed in each fund  additionally other fees are earned for
advisoryrelated administrative services  independent directors and trustees
of the price funds regularly review fee structures

the advisory fee paid by each of the price funds generally is computed each
day by multiplying a funds net assets by a fee  for the majority of the
price funds the fee is equal to the sum of a group charge that is set based
on the combined net assets of those funds and an individual fund charge that
page 6
is set based on the funds specific investment objective  as the combined
net assets of these funds increase the group charge component of the funds
fee decreases  details of each funds fee arrangement are available in its
prospectus

each of the price funds has a distinct investment objective that has been
developed as part of our strategy to provide a broad comprehensive selection
of investing opportunities  all price funds are sold exclusively on a
noload basis without a sales commission  noload mutual funds offer
investors a lowcost and relatively easy method of investing in a variety of
stock and bond portfolios  our advisor class of fund shares is sold through
financial intermediaries and incurs a 12b1 fee of 25 basis points for
distribution and recordkeeping  we believe that our lower fund cost
structure distribution methods and fund shareholder and administrative
services promote stability of assets in the price funds through market
cycles

each price fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation
and the issuance and redemption of its securities  in particular each fund
pays investment advisory fees shareholder servicing fees and expenses fund
accounting fees and expenses transfer agent fees custodian fees and
expenses legal and auditing fees expenses of preparing printing and
mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders
registration fees and expenses proxy and annual meeting expenses and
independent trustee or director fees and expenses

several of the price funds have different fee arrangements  the equity
market index funds and the summit funds have single allinclusive fees
covering all investment management and operating expenses  the spectrum
growth spectrum income and spectrum international funds invest in a broadly
diversified portfolio of other price funds and have no separate investment
advisory fee  however they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in
which they invest  funds targeted to institutional investors each have
separate advisory fee arrangements

we usually guarantee that a newly organized funds expenses will not exceed a
specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period

other investment portfolios  we managed 604 billion at december 31 2000
in investment portfolios other than the price funds down 5 billion from the
beginning of the year  we provide investment advisory services to these
client accounts on a separatelymanaged or subadvised basis and through
sponsored investment portfolios generally organized by us as common trust
funds or partnerships  our sponsored investment partnerships were formed in
prior years through private placements and several of our specialpurpose
subsidiaries serve as the general partners

we usually compute fees for nonprice fund accounts based upon the value of
assets under our management  approximately 50 of our advisory fees from
these clients are based on the daily valuation of their investment
portfolios while more than 10 are based on beginning of billing period
values and less than 40 on values at the end of the billing period

we charge fees for investment management based on among other things the
specific investment services to be provided  our standard form of investment
advisory agreement for client accounts provides that the agreement may be
terminated at any time and that any unearned fees paid in advance will be
refunded

our subsidiaries also provide targeted advisory services to our nonprice
fund investment clients  stable value investment contracts totaling 8
billion at december 31 1999 and 2000 are managed by t rowe price stable
asset management  international equity and fixed income securities held in
other investment portfolios managed by t rowe price international totaled
155 billion at the end of 2000 down 48 billion from the beginning of the
page 10
year

regulation  t rowe price associates t rowe price international t rowe

management regulatory organisation in great britain  our transfer agent
services subsidiaries are registered under the securities exchange act of
1934 and our trust company is regulated by the state of maryland
commissioner of financial regulation  t rowe price savings bank is
regulated by the office of thrift supervision us department of the
treasury

the price funds are distributed by our subsidiary t rowe price investment
services which is a registered brokerdealer and member of the national
association of securities dealers and the securities investor protection
corporation  we provide discount brokerage services through this subsidiary
primarily to complement the other services provided to shareholders of the
price funds  all discount brokerage transactions are cleared through and
accounts maintained by an independent clearing broker  in late 2000 we
changed clearing firms to the pershing division of donaldson lufkin 
jenrette securities corporation

all aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal and state laws
and regulations  these laws and regulations are primarily intended to
benefit or protect our clients and the price funds shareholders  they
generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers
including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of business in the event
that we fail to comply with laws and regulations  possible sanctions that

to substantial competition in all aspects of our business  a significant
number of mutual funds are sold to the public by investment management firms
brokerdealers other mutual fund companies banks and insurance companies
and include the distribution of both proprietary and other sponsors mutual
funds  we compete with brokerage and investment banking firms insurance
companies banks and other financial institutions in all aspects of our
business  many of these financial institutions have substantially greater
resources than we do  we compete with other providers of investment
management services primarily on the basis of the availability and objectives
of investment portfolios offered investment performance and the scope and
quality of our services
page 11
we believe that competition within the investment management industry will
increase as a result of consolidation and acquisition activity  in order to
maintain and enhance our competitive position we may review acquisition
prospects and if appropriate opportunities arise engage in discussions or
negotiations that could lead to acquisitions

additionally we continue to review our distribution strategies and have
expanded them beyond the direct marketing of low cost noload mutual funds
to the selfdirected investor  at the end of 2000 our assets under
management were sourced approximately 30 from individual investors 30 from
defined contribution retirement plans 20 from thirdparty distribution and
20 from institutional investors  our largest client account relationship
provided less than 4 of our total investment advisory revenues in 2000

time employees  we add additional temporary and parttime personnel to our
staff to meet periodic and special project demands for technology functions
and mutual fund administrative services

item 3  legal proceedings

on july 6 1998 rowe pricefleming the t rowe price international stock
fund and the funds five directors were named as defendants in migdal v rowe
pricefleming international inc et al filed in the united states
district court for the district of maryland  the complaint sought to
invalidate the advisory agreement between rowe pricefleming and the
international stock fund and sought recovery of an unspecified amount of
advisory fees paid by the international stock fund to rowe pricefleming
plaintiffs alleged that the international stock fund does not have a
sufficient number of independent directors as required by the investment
company act of 1940 as amended because its independent directors serve on
multiple boards of directors within the t rowe price mutual fund complex and
receive substantial compensation in the form of director fees  on october
12 1998 the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding as a plaintiff
linda b rohrbaugh a shareholder in the t rowe price growth stock fund
the amended complaint also added as defendants the t rowe price growth stock
fund t rowe price associates and certain of its subsidiaries which provide
services to the funds as well as five directors of the t rowe price growth
stock fund  on january 21 1999 the amended complaint was dismissed with
leave for plaintiffs to refile  on february 16 1999 the plaintiffs filed
a second amended complaint but the fund directors were excluded as
defendants  the second amended complaint alleged a claim under section 36b
of the investment company act of 1940  the complaint sought to invalidate
the advisory and service agreements negotiated between the corporate
defendants and certain t rowe price funds based on a claim that i the fees
paid to the corporate defendants were excessive and ii the advisory
agreements were not negotiated at arms length because each of the boards of
directors of the price funds is not independent as required under the
investment company act of 1940  on march 19 1999 we and the other
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint  in an
order dated march 20 2000 our motion was granted and the case dismissed
with prejudice  on april 6 2000 the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of
the dismissal of the case  on june 16 2000 we and the other defendants
filed a brief with the united states court of appeals fourth circuit to
affirm the district courts judgment

from time to time claims arise in the ordinary course of our business
including employmentrelated claims  after consulting with counsel we
believe it unlikely that any adverse determination in one or more pending
claims would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations

page 15
rate in december 2000 was the fifteenth consecutive annual increase since we
became a public company in april 1986



item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations

our revenues and net income are derived primarily from investment advisory
services provided to us individual and institutional investors in our
sponsored mutual funds and other investment portfolios

we manage a broad range of domestic and international stock bond and money
market mutual funds and other investment portfolios which meet the varied
needs and objectives of individual and institutional investors  investment
page 16
advisory revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets
under management  accordingly fluctuations in financial markets and in the
composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of
operations  total assets under our management were 1667 billion at
december 31 2000 including 949 billion in domestic equity securities and
317 billion in international equity securities

rowe pricefleming international acquisition

on august 8 2000 we completed our purchase of robert fleming holdings 50
interest in our consolidated subsidiary rowe pricefleming international
which at that time managed 375 billion  this purchase transaction resulted
in goodwill of 704 million which is being amortized on a straightline basis
over 25 years  coincident with the change in ownership our subsidiary was
renamed t rowe price international and our international research contracts
with robert fleming affiliates were terminated  transition services are
being provided to us by certain robert fleming affiliates during an interim
period in which we are establishing the new operating infrastructure for our
international investment operations  additionally we are now expanding our
marketing efforts to include european investors and may seek other investors
on a global basis  our expenditures in these efforts may be significant and
will precede revenues from any new investment advisory clients that we may
obtain

results of operations

2000 versus 1999  net income increased nearly 30 million or 12 to 269
million and diluted earnings per share rose from 185 to 208  total
revenues increased 17 from 1 billion to a record 12 billion led by an
increase of 115 million in investment advisory fees

investment advisory revenues earned from the t rowe price mutual funds
increased 86 million as average fund assets under management were 1139
billion during 2000 131 billion more than in 1999  however declines in
financial market valuations pushed fund assets down 55 billion during the
year  net redemptions by fund investors were 17 billion during 2000
defined contribution plans moved 2 billion to other advisors on the last day
of the year offsetting net inflows that had occurred until that time  the
merger of a client into another firm and the restructuring of investments by
a large state pension plan were the primary causes of the outflows at year
end  other fund asset decreases were the result of our redemption of almost
5 billion to partially fund the rowe pricefleming acquisition and 5
billion of dividends net of reinvestments that were paid out during the
year  mutual fund assets ended 2000 at 1063 billion including 843
billion in stock funds

assets in the other investment portfolios that we manage were also higher
during most of 2000 and contributed 25 million of additional advisory fees
in addition performancerelated advisory fees were 4 million higher in
2000  we earn performance fees primarily on venture capital investments that
we manage and though recurring these fees will vary significantly as market
page 17
conditions and investment portfolios change  assets in other portfolios that
we manage ended 2000 at 604 billion down from 654 billion at the
beginning of the year due primarily to international portfolios which
experienced both market depreciation of 33 billion and outflows of 15
billion during 2000

administrative fees from advisoryrelated services that we provide to the
funds and their shareholders rose 396 million from 1999 to 2369 million
this increase is primarily attributable to transfer agency and recordkeeping
services for defined contribution retirement plans and the price mutual funds
and includes 11 million of 12b1 distribution fees received from the new
advisor class of mutual fund shares  administrative revenues are largely
offset by the costs that we incur in providing the services including fees
paid to thirdparties which distribute the advisor shares to their clients
discount brokerage added 14 million of the increase on greater transaction
volume offset by lower average commissions arising from the shift to
transactions originating over the internet

investment and other income rose more than 21 million from 1999 to 59
million  net gains of 74 million on dispositions of our stock and bond
mutual fund holdings in 2000 versus losses of 16 million recognized on fund
holdings in 1999 account for 90 million of the increase  higher returns on
our venture capital investments added 29 million in 2000  the strong
markets of late 1999 and early 2000 produced significant market gains and
distributions from venture capital investments  income from this source will
vary with market conditions and the size of our investments  larger capital
gain distributions resulting from our stock fund holdings added 20 million
to our 2000 income  foreign currency rate fluctuations arising from our yen
denominated debt account for a positive change of 46 million as the losses
experienced in 1999 largely reversed in 2000  we expect that investment
income will generally be lower in future periods

operating expenses increased 21 to 754 million  greater compensation and
related costs which were up 51 million or 16 were attributable to
increases in our rates of compensation including performancerelated
bonuses and an 8 increase in our staff size primarily to support our
growing  operations  as of december 31 2000 we employed more than 4000
associates  our advertising and promotion expenditures increased 141
million from the prior year to 882 million  these costs will vary with
market conditions and investor demand for our products as we seek to expand
our base both domestically and internationally  we expect spending in 2001
to exceed that of 2000 and in particular the first quarter of 2001 to be
slightly higher than the preceding fourth quarter of 2000

international investment research fees were down 17 million from 1999 as the
contract for these services terminated at the time of the rowe pricefleming
acquisition occupancy and equipment expense was 161 million higher in 2000
due primarily to the expansion of our operating facilities in owings mills in
late 1999 and early 2000  amortization of goodwill arising from the rowe
pricefleming purchase and interest expense on our acquisition indebtedness
added 111 million and 93 million respectively to our 2000 expenses
page 18
under current accounting principles goodwill charges of 7 million per
quarter will recur in the future  other operating expenses increased 47
million largely due to significant broadbased technology expenditures that
support established and new business activities  additional expenses in
connection with our international expansion also contributed to the higher
expense levels  costs incurred for defined contribution plan recordkeeping
systems and the distribution of the advisor class of fund shares also
increased our expense levels however these charges were generally offset by
additional administrative revenues  we anticipate that our operating
expenses in at least the first half of 2001 will continue to be higher in
comparison to prior comparable periods but that the amount of increase will
moderate from that experienced in the second half of 2000

the 2000 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is
higher than that of 1999 largely due to the new goodwill charges that are not
deductible in determining our income tax expense  the effective tax rate
will rise again in 2000 as we recognize a full years amortization of
goodwill

minority interests declined 59 million due to the acquisition of robert
flemings 50 interest in rowe pricefleming

1999 versus 1998  net income increased 65 million or 37 to 239 million
or diluted earnings per share of 185 from 174 million or diluted earnings
per share of 134  total revenues increased 17 from 886 million to a
record 104 billion led by an increase of 117 million in investment
advisory fees

investment advisory revenues earned from sponsored mutual fund investment
portfolios increased 73 million as average fund assets under management were
1008 billion 129 billion more than in 1998  fund assets increased 201
billion during the year and totaled 1145 billion at december 31 1999
including 926 billion in stock and blended assets funds  the most
significant increase in fund assets during 1999 was attributable to market
appreciation of and income reinvested in the stock and blended funds totaling
19 billion  net cash inflows to the funds during the year totaled 11
billion including inflows of more than 23 billion into domestic stock and
blended funds offset in part by 10 billion of outflows from international
stock funds and 2 billion from bond and money market funds  domestic
growth stock funds accounted for the largest net inflows with the science 
technology and blue chip growth funds each drawing more than 1 billion

greater assets in other investment portfolios including variable annuity and
other subadvised funds and an increase of 9 million in performancebased
fees contributed the balance of advisory revenue gains totaling 44 million
assets under management in other investment portfolios were 654 billion at
december 31 1999 up 12 billion during 1999

administrative fees from advisoryrelated services to the funds and their
shareholders rose 24 million from 1998 to 197 million  this increase was
primarily attributable to defined contribution retirement plan recordkeeping
page 19
services however increased operating expenses offset these gains
commissions earned on greater discount brokerage trading volume contributed
nearly 5 million of the revenue increase

investment and other income rose 9 million from 1998 including 6 million
from larger money market fund balances and nearly 6 million from venture
capital investments offset by almost 3 million of foreign currency exchange
rate loss on the yendenominated debt

operating expenses increased 8 to nearly 622 million  greater compensation
and related costs which were up 25 million or 8 were attributable to
increases in rates of compensation including performancerelated bonuses
and an increase in staff size of 6 primarily to support the growing
investmentrelated administrative services and technologybased operations
these increases in compensation costs were partially offset by reduced use of
temporary staff and the capitalization of almost 5 million for the
development of internaluse software  at yearend 1999 more than 3700
associates were employed  advertising and promotion expenditures increased
2 to 74 million in 1999  occupancy and equipment expense was nearly 11
million higher in 1999 due to the expansion of operating facilities and
related equipment acquisitions primarily leases of technology assets
international investment research fees were up nearly 6 million as
international assets under management increased during 1999 from 329
billion to 427 billion including 224 billion in the mutual funds
international assets are managed by our consolidated subsidiary rowe price
fleming international and are included in the consolidated assets under
management  other operating expenses increased 6 million to support growing
operations

the crossover of operations into 2000 was made successfully  expenditures
for the comprehensive efforts involved totaled 37 million through yearend
including more than 18 million in 1999 an increase of about 1 million from
1998

the 1999 provision for income taxes as a percentage of pretax income is lower
than that of 1998 due to changes in income apportionment for purposes of
state taxation

capital resources and liquidity

we financed the rowe pricefleming acquisition from available cash holdings
of 483 million and borrowings of 300 million from the fiveyear 500
million syndicated bank credit facility that we obtained in june 2000  we
have also obtained a complementary 100 million 364day syndicated bank
credit facility  we reduced outstanding borrowings 5 million in november
2000 and expect that available cash resources will be used to further reduce
borrowings in 2001

during the three years ended december 31 2000 stockholders equity more
than doubled increasing from 487 million to 991 million  stockholders
equity at december 31 2000 includes 33 million of unrealized security
page 20
holding gains after provision for income taxes on investments and 52
million which is restricted as to use under various regulations and
agreements arising in the ordinary course of business  net liquid assets of
about 250 million were available at the beginning of 2001

operating activities provided net cash inflows of 323 million in 2000 as net
income increased 30 million from the prior year  comparatively 1999
provided net operating cash inflows of 297 million  net cash expended in
investing activities increased 743 million from 1999 to 861 million
expenditures in 2000 included 783 million for the acquisition of robert
flemings interest in rowe pricefleming and 86 million for additions to
property and equipment more than half of which was for completing our
building projects and outfitting the new space  cash provided from financing
activities was 260 million in 2000 this compares with cash used in
financing activities of 104 million in 1999 net bank borrowings used to
partially fund the rowe pricefleming acquisition provided cash of 295
million in 2000  there were no repurchases of common stock in 2000 compared
with 67 million used to repurchase shares in 1999 dividends paid to common
stockholders were 63 million 15 million higher than 1999 as the pershare
dividend was again increased

anticipated property and equipment acquisitions in 2001 are approximately 57
million including completion of the international infrastructure to support
the operations of t rowe price international these capital expenditures are
expected to be funded from operating cash inflows



quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we invest in our sponsored mutual funds which are market risk sensitive
financial instruments held for purposes other than trading we do not invest
in derivative financial or commodity instruments  mutual fund investments
have inherent market risk in the form of equity price risk that is the
potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair
values of the mutual fund shares  each fund and its underlying net assets
are also subject to market risk which may arise from changes in equity
prices credit ratings foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates

the following table in thousands of dollars presents the equity price risk
from investments in sponsored mutual funds by assuming a hypothetical decline
in the fair values of mutual fund shares  this potential future loss of
value reflects the valuation of mutual fund investments at year end using
each funds lowest fair value per share during the prior twelve months  in
considering this presentation it is important to note that  all funds did
not experience their lowest fair value per share on the same day it is
likely that the composition of the mutual fund investment portfolio would be
changed if adverse market conditions persisted and we could experience
future losses in excess of those presented below

the comparable potential loss of value shown in last years annual report was
39 million on sponsored mutual fund investments of 234 million at the end
of 1999  during 2000 we incurred net unrealized losses of 19 million in
the value of our mutual fund investments  we last recognized a net loss in
the value of our fund holdings in 1994

investments in mutual funds generally moderate market risk because funds by
their nature invest in a number of different financial instruments  t rowe
price further manages its exposure to market risk by diversifying its
investments among many domestic and international funds  in addition
investment holdings may be altered from timetotime in response to changes
in market risks and other factors as deemed appropriate by management

in evaluating market risk it is also important to consider the risk that the
value of managed investment portfolios will decline  because revenues and
net income are based primarily on the value of assets under management
declines of financial market values will negatively impact revenues and net
income

the us dollar strengthened against the japanese yen in 2000 and an
exchange rate gain was recognized on the yen borrowing that reversed much of
the loss recognized in 1999  in evaluating exchange rate sensitivity a loss
of nearly 2 million would be recognized if the yen strengthened 10 from

operating expenses which are subject to fluctuation for the following or
other reasons  changes in the level of advertising expenses in response to
market conditions expansion of marketing efforts both within the us and
internationally or other factors variations in the level of compensation
expense due to among other things performancebased bonuses changes in our
