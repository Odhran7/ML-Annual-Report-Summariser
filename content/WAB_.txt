industry overview 

the company primarily serves the global freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of freight railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization and growth in developing markets a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness increasing investment in technology solutions an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight rail and passenger transit 

the association of the european rail industry unife advocates for and represents european train builders and rail suppliers unife publishes a biennial market study that provides an overview of the market in its current form and a forecast of its future development in different regions and market segments according to the 2020 biennial edition of the study the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 120 billion and is expected to grow in the medium and longterm at an average annual growth rate of 23 through 2025 despite an 8 covidinduced decline in 2020 the 2020 study also concluded that the rail sector had grown 36 annually since 2017 supporting the appeal of rail transport for all sectors from urban metro to commercial freight the three largest geographic markets which represented about 85 of the total accessible market were europe north america and asia pacific all of which are projected to continue to grow 

in europe only 19 of freight traffic is rail while the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental policies encourage continued investment in public mass transit and modal shift from car to rail although this growth may be stunted in the nearterm as a result of the covid19 pandemic in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation north america’s rail network is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 600 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by continued investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets india is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system 

according to unife most emerging markets including russiacis commonwealth of independent states and africamiddle east are expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade leads to increased freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems with about 13 million freight cars and about 21000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world the covid19 pandemic has impacted the expected growth in these emerging markets 

as growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets new technologies offered by wabtec can provide solutions to improve safety cost and reliability of rail as well as support the modernization of the global rail fleets in its study unife also said it expected increased investment in digitalization automation and predictive maintenance through artificial intelligence all of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry

health and safety 

when it comes to employee safety our commitment is to provide safe work environments for our employees and to meet or exceed environmental health and safety ehs laws and regulations in the places where we operate in 2020 the company relaunched the environment health and safety component of the wabtec management system known as the “ehs wms” to strengthen our management system approach to addressing ehs risks and promote the consistent implementation of best practices across all our global manufacturing and services sites regardless of how local laws are implemented or enforced the ehs wms establishes standard expectations in 13 core competency areas including leadership and accountability regulatory applicability review ehs processes and systems risk assessment safety defenses exposure defenses environmental defenses 

and contractor management operational sites are measured against these ehs program expectations in addition the company’s ehs wms is directly aligned to accepted international standards such as iso 14001 for environmental and iso 45001 for occupational health and safety with zero fatalities and over 80 operational sites with zero recordable injuries 2020 marked the 13th consecutive year of injury rate reductions across wabtecs vast operations 

in 2021 wabtec continued its commitment to safety and launched a four week ehs leadership training course aimed at building the toolkits of frontline supervisors and plant managers the course was designed to establish a common understanding of wabtec’s ehs tools and terminology initiate a partnership between the plant manager and their ehs leader on a personal action plan connect plant managers to the broader network of global leaders and encourage decision making at the site level that is informed by an understanding of ehs impacts and of legal and compliance responsibilities in 2021 over 120 leaders from 26 countries attended the training 

covid19 

the pandemic has reinforced the importance of keeping wabtec employees safe and healthy while keeping essential rail services and the global economy moving when the pandemic began wabtec launched its covid19 crisis management team which met daily to focus on three key elements protecting our people serving our customers and ensuring business continuity manufacturing and office locations were required to implement risk assessment methodologies and rethink work practices to allow for remote working or social distancing develop new procedures for workplace entry strengthen sitelevel crisis management teams and implement new tools for rapid communication with site employees site leaders and people managers were trained on techniques for communicating transparently and navigating complex business decisions during a crisis 

compensation and benefits 

we remain committed to a strong payfor performance philosophy that aligns individual performance behaviors and business results with individual rewards to deliver on that commitment we utilize market data to benchmark to the external market and consider factors such as an employee’s role and experience the location of the job and performance when determining compensation 

we provide our employees resources to help them succeed we offer a wide range of benefits including healthcare and wellness benefits retirement benefits an employee assistance program employee resource groups to build diverse communities at wabtec and paid time off 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the us and around the world these entities typically govern equipment safety and interoperability standards for freight rail rolling stock and passenger transit oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers new products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy as a result of these regulations and requirements we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries the governing bodies include the fra and the association of american railroads aar in the us and the international union of railways “uic” and the european railway agencies in europe also in europe the european committees for standardization continually draft new european standards which cover for example the reliability availability maintainability and safety of railways systems to guarantee interoperability in europe the european union for railway agencies is responsible for defining and implementing technical standards of interoperability which covers areas such as infrastructure energy rolling stock telematic applications traffic operation and management subsystems noise pollution and waste generation protection against fire and smoke and system safety 

most countries and regions in which wabtec does business have similar rulemaking bodies for example in russia a gostr certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals in russian territory in china any product or system sold on the chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards in the local indian market most products are covered by regulations patterned after aar and uic standards 

effects of seasonality 

our business has limited seasonality third quarter results may be affected by the timing of services performed under our locomotive maintenance contracts and vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers fourth quarter results may be affected by the timing of spare parts and service orders placed by transit agencies worldwide quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays 

environmental matters 

the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with 

releases of hazardous substances the company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements

 item 1a risk factors tableend

risks related to our business and operations 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with wabtec in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result customer order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations furthermore the average service life of certain products in our end markets has increased in recent years due to innovations in technologies and manufacturing processes which has also allowed end users to replace parts less often as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a global competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do may have a more extensive lowcost sourcing strategy and presence in lowcost regions than we do or may receive significant governmental support price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers with significant negotiating power has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support if our competitors invest heavily in innovation and develop products that are more efficient or effective than our products we may not be able to compete effectively there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our existing products or to react appropriately to changes in demand we may experience delayed product shipments and customer dissatisfaction if demand increases significantly from current levels both we and our suppliers may have difficulty meeting such demand particularly if such demand increases occur rapidly alternatively we may carry excess inventory if demand for our products decreases below projected levels 

additionally we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors furthermore we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

failure to accurately predict and react to customer demand could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to respond adequately or in a timely manner to innovative changes in new technology 

in recent years the global transportation landscape has been characterized by rapid changes in technology leading to innovative transportation and logistics concepts that could change the way the railway industry does business there may be additional innovations impacting the railway industry that we cannot yet foresee any failure by us to quickly adapt to and adopt new innovations in products and processes desired by our customers may result in a significant loss of demand for our product and service offerings in addition advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term for example the economic slowdown that was caused by covid19 impacted the timing of some orders as customers deferred the delivery of some goods and services to future years reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical and is influenced by a variety of factors new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced by a variety of factors including major replacement programs the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities and the quality and cost of alternative modes of transportation to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or canceled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and wabtec 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations for example although the company saw no material cancellations of backlog during the year ended december 31 2021 the economic slowdown that was caused by covid19 did impact the timing of some orders in backlog as the delivery of goods and services previously expected to be completed in the current year were pushed out to subsequent periods 

equipment failures interruptions delays in deliveries or extensive damage to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

all of our facilities equipment supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as cyber attacks disease outbreak fires earthquakes explosions floods tornadoes hurricanes or weather conditions an interruption in our manufacturing capabilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems whether as a result of such catastrophic loss or any other reason could reduce prevent or delay our production and shipment of our product offerings result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses this could result in the delay or termination of orders the loss of future sales and a negative impact to our reputation with our customers 

thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to such matters will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses any of these risks coming to fruition could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of disruptions or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results due to the ongoing impacts and uncertainty of continued impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the global government actions to contain it some of our supply chains particularly in china india the us and europe have been and continue to be impacted supply chain disruptions and labor availability have caused component and chip shortages resulting in an adverse effect on the timing of the company’s revenue generation additionally broadbased inflation escalation of metals and commodities costs transportation and logistics costs and labor costs have all resulted from the covid19 pandemic there can be no assurance that there will not be further or deeper supply chain disruptions or that the steps we are taking to mitigate such disruptions will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion 

in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

• difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies including the integration of operations services and products 

• diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the assumption of unknown liabilities and 

• unanticipated changes in the market conditions business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition joint venture or alliance 

we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify or consummate suitable acquisitions joint ventures or alliances we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in such strategic transactions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement this strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

although we believe that our recent acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

• the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results 

• significant expenses to integrate 

• diversion of management’s attention from business operations to integration matters 

• departure of key personnel from the acquired business 

• effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decisionmaking 

• integration of different information systems 

• unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities and 

• impairment of assets 

the effects of covid19 and other potential future public health crises epidemics pandemics or similar events on our business operating results and cash flows are uncertain 

we face a wide variety of risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks including the global outbreak of covid19 since first reported in late 2019 the covid19 pandemic has dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment including millions of confirmed cases business slowdowns or shutdowns government challenges and market volatility of an unprecedented nature although we have to date managed to continue most of our operations we cannot predict the future course of events nor can we assure that this global pandemic including its economic impact will not have a material adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic related developments including the duration of the pandemic any potential subsequent waves of covid19 and new strains of the virus the effectiveness distribution and acceptance of covid19 vaccines and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted our operations may be further impacted by the covid19 pandemic if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines travel restrictions or absenteeism steps the company has taken to protect health and wellbeing government actions facility closures work slowdowns or stoppages inadequate supplies or resources such as reliable personal protective equipment testing and vaccines or other circumstances related to covid19 governments around the world have taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in operational and supply chain disruptions for us and our customers and may further adversely affect operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers accordingly covid19 had a materially adverse impact on our operations and business results for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 supply chain disruptions and shortages in labor availability have caused component and chip shortages which have resulted in adverse effects on the timing of our revenue generation additionally broadbased inflation escalation of metals and commodities costs transportation and logistics costs and labor costs have all resulted from the covid19 pandemic and have adversely impacted our business w e expect covid19 to continue to have a materially adverse impact on our operations and business results into 2022 the spread of covid19 and the emergence of new strains of the virus have caused us to modify our business practices and to implement significant proactive measures to protect the health and safety of employees and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are appropriate under the circumstances there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the continued risks posed by the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and related volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could affect our business and operations in a variety of ways for example we have experienced and could experience further operational disruptions and financial losses as a result of the following 

• a decrease in demand for our products as a result of covid19 and cost control measures implemented by our customers 

• delays in orders or delivery of orders the occurrence of which negatively impacts our cash conversion cycle and ability to convert our backlog into cash 

• inability to collect full or partial payments from customers due to deterioration in customer liquidity including customer bankruptcies 

• a shutdown of one or multiple of our manufacturing facilities due to government restrictions or illness in connection with covid19 

the continued spread of covid19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which depending on future developments may make it more costly or difficult for us to obtain debt or equity financing including to refinance our existing debt or to identify or execute on investment opportunities in each case on terms and within time periods acceptable to us we are also monitoring the impacts of covid19 on the fair value of our assets while we do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of covid19 future changes in expectations for sales earnings and cash flows related to intangible assets and goodwill below our current projections could cause these assets to be impaired 

we continue to work with our stakeholders including customers employees suppliers and local communities in an effort to address responsibly this global pandemic we continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our employees business supply chain and customers and to take certain actions in an effort to mitigate various adverse consequences however uncertainty around general global economic and market conditions exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic will have an impact on our sales and operations in 2022 and beyond 

we expect that the longer the covid19 pandemic including its economic disruption continues the greater the adverse impact on our business operations financial performance and results of operations could be given the tremendous uncertainties and variables we cannot at this time predict the impact of the global covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic but any one could have a material adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

risks related to international operations 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 approximately 60 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the united states we intend to continue to expand our international operations including in emerging markets in the future our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france and we conduct other international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures including in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy kazakhstan macedonia mexico the netherlands poland russia spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

• lack of complete operating control 

• lack of local business experience 

• currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations 

• restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital 

• the complexities of operating within multiple tax jurisdictions 

• foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls 

• adverse impacts of international trade policies such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs 

• difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights 

• the challenges of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments 

• the difficulties involved in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• economic political and social instability 

• possible local catastrophes such as natural disasters and epidemics and 

• possible terrorist attacks conflicts and wars including those against american interests 

our exposure to the risks associated with international operations may intensify if our international operations expand in the future 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn and report revenues and vice versa in addition a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from nonus operations and the translated value of the net assets of our nonus operations when reported in us dollars in our consolidated financial statements we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we have substantial operations located in emerging markets and are subject to regulatory economic social and political uncertainties in such markets 

we have substantial operations located in emerging markets such as brazil india kazakhstan the russian federation and ukraine operations in such emerging markets are inherently risky due to a number of regulatory economic social and political uncertainties these risks include economies that may be dependent on only a few products and are therefore subject to significant fluctuations weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights possible exchange controls unstable governments nationalization or privatization actions or other government actions affecting the flow of goods and currency 

significant changes in economic and regulatory policy in emerging countries as well as social or political uncertainties could significantly harm business and economic conditions in these markets generally and could disproportionately impact the rail industry which could adversely affect our business and prospects in these markets 

in addition physical and financial infrastructure may be less developed in some emerging countries than that of many developed nations any disruptions with respect to banking and financial infrastructure communication systems or any public facility including transportation infrastructure could disrupt our normal business activity such disruptions could interrupt our business operations and significantly harm our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions and policies 

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally particularly in our key end markets could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may be exposed to raw material shortages supply shortages and fluctuations in raw material energy and commodity prices 

we purchase energy steel aluminum copper rubber and rubberbased materials chemicals polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources and traditionally have not had longterm pricing contracts with our pure raw material suppliers the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers experience a lag in our ability to pass increases to our customers or operational efficiencies are not achieved our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our businesses compete globally for key production inputs in addition we rely upon thirdparty suppliers including certain singlesourced suppliers for various components for our products in the event of a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs we may experience challenges sourcing certain of our components to meet our production requirements and may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of certain raw materials or key inputs any such shortage may materially adversely affect our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs 

changes to international trade policies including tariffs and foreign trade restrictions could adversely affect our business 

as a global transportation company we generate export sales from our us operations and also derive international sales through our foreign subsidiaries licensees and joint ventures we also do business with industry suppliers located in various international markets a protectionist trade environment in either the united states or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may adversely affect our business in particular such policies may impact or delay our customers investments in our products reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain markets and inhibit our ability to costeffectively purchase necessary inputs from certain suppliers in addition to the extent developments in international trade relations result in reduced global trade or slower growth in global trade it is likely that this would result in reductions in investment in freight and transit rail 

international trade policies are affected by a diverse array of factors including global and national economic and political conditions which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions although we actively monitor developments in international trade and proactively engage in efforts to mitigate the effect of trade policies there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be successful 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including anticorruption laws in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to various laws rules and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions in which we do business such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act the french law n° 20161691 sapin ii and the uk bribery act relating to our business and our employees we are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations including regulations administered by the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security the us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control and various nonus government entities including applicable export control regulations economic sanctions on countries and persons customs requirements currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations despite our policies procedures and compliance programs our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect us from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could 

damage our reputation subject us to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt our business and as a result could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition our manufacturing operations are subject to safety operations maintenance and mechanical standards rules and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations both domestically and internationally our business may be adversely impacted by new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules or regulations which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of certain of our products or could make such products obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to their useful lives we are unable to predict what impact these or other regulatory changes may have if any on our business or the industry as a whole we cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with any new standards or regulations will not be material to our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water substances in products the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we have incurred and will continue to incur both operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations including costs associated with the cleanup and investigation of some of our current and former properties and offsite disposal locations we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have significant consequences on our business and results of operations including the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations injunctive relief including requirements that we limit or cease operations at affected facilities and reputational risk 

in addition certain of our products are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent statutory and regulatory requirements governing eg  emissions and noise including standards imposed by the us environmental protection agency the european union and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures relating to compliance with these standards the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of these standardsparticularly in emerging marketsare unpredictable and subject to change 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

management believes it is reasonably likely that the scientific and political attention to issues concerning the existence and extent of climate change and the role of human activity in it will continue with the potential for further regulation that affects the company’s operations the potential challenges posed by evolving climate change policy and prospective legislation are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry although uncertain these developments could increase costs or reduce the demand for the products the company sells the company’s production and processing operations typically result in emissions of greenhouse gases likewise emissions arise from midstream and downstream operations including operations of our locomotives and other products finally although beyond the control of the company the use of fuels and related products by operators also results in greenhouse gas emissions that may be regulated international agreements domestic legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions are currently in various phases of discussion or implementation while we are carefully monitoring developments and reviewing the challenges associated with alternative proposals at this time we cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on our operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until legislative policy is more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

the occurrence of litigation in which we are or could be named as a defendant is unpredictable 

from time to time we are subject directly or through our subsidiaries to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business customers suppliers creditors stockholders product liability including asbestos claims intellectual property infringement competition and antitrust claims warranty claims or environmentalrelated matters 

due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all in addition although in some cases we may be indemnified by nonaffiliated entities that retain liabilities in connection with specific matters there can be no assurance that these indemnitors will remain financially viable and capable of satisfying their obligations 

any litigation even a claim without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

risks related to data security and intellectual property 

if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we may be adversely affected 

our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely primarily on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and unfair competition laws as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights however filing prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive moreover existing us legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights as a result a significant portion of our technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology further although we routinely conduct anticounterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions we have encountered counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights counterfeit components of low quality may negatively impact our brand value accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon counterfeiting or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights then our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

in addition we operate in industries in which there are many thirdparty owners of intellectual property rights owners of intellectual property that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable third party intellectual property owners may assert infringement claims against us based on their intellectual property portfolios if we are sued for intellectual property infringement we may incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims even if we prevail 

we face cybersecurity and data protection risks relating to cyberattacks and information technology failures that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on the security stability and availability of technology systems in our business we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information including proprietary business information personal data and other information that may be subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed data protection controls our business may be adversely impacted by unintentional technology disruptions including those resulting from programming errors employee operational errors software defects and product vulnerabilities 

we also provide technological products integral to train operation accordingly our business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to our own or thirdparty information technology infrastructure which could result from cybersecurity incidents including but not limited to unauthorized access to the company’s information technology systems data access or acquisition andor encryption of the company’s environment for instance one of our vendors publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in its operating system that we use for certain wabtec products a successful exploitation of our own or our vendors’ information technology infrastructure could result in service interruptions safety hazards misappropriation of confidential information process failures security breaches or other operational difficulties such an event could result in decreased revenues and increased capital insurance or operating costs including the increased costs of security to protect the 

company’s infrastructure among other results insurance maintained by the company to protect against loss of business and other related consequences resulting from cyber incidents may not be sufficient to cover all damages a disruption or compromise of the company’s technology systems even for short periods of time could have a material adverse effect 

risks related to human capital 

labor shortages and labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we depend on skilled labor in our manufacturing and other businesses due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate we may not be able to retain recruit and train the personnel we require particularly when the economy expands production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases 

we collectively bargain with labor unions at some of our operations throughout the world failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations furthermore nonunion employees in certain countries have the right to strike if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel 

any such labor shortages or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team and other key employees in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results if we lose key personnel because they terminate their employment or retire or as a result of illness disability or death or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teams attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key personnel that we lose or we may not be able to hire potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2021 we had total debt of 41 billion primarily related to senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example our indebtedness could 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we operate 

• place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt and 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds 

moreover our credit agreement and the indentures governing our senior notes permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness which may further contribute to or exacerbate the impact of the foregoing impacts 

the indentures for our outstanding senior notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

our credit agreement subjects us to customary i affirmative covenants including requirements with respect to certain reporting obligations on us and our subsidiaries and ii negative covenants including limitations on indebtedness liens restricted payments fundamental changes including certain changes in control business activities transactions with affiliates restrictive agreements changes in fiscal year and use of proceeds in addition we are required to maintain i a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 300 to 100 over each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter and ii a leverage ratio calculated as of the last day of a fiscal quarter for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of 325 to 100 or less provided that in the second quarter of 2021 the credit agreement was amended so that we may upon our request increase the maximum leverage ratio to x 375 to 100 at the end of the fiscal quarter in which our acquisition of nordco was consummated and each of the three fiscal quarters immediately following such fiscal quarter and y 

350 to 100 at the end of each of the fourth and fifth full fiscal quarters after the consummation of such acquisition the company has not requested any such increase in the leverage ratio at this time 

the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain covenants and restrictions which limit subject to certain exceptions certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties the incurrence of secured debt without equally and ratably securing the senior notes and certain merger and consolidation transactions in addition the indentures require that we offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend

overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of locomotives valueadded technologybased equipment systems and services for the global freight rail and passenger transit industries our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on most locomotives freight cars passenger transit cars and buses around the world our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in over 50 countries and our products can be found in more than 100 countries throughout the world in 2021 approximately 60 of the company’s net sales came from customers outside the us 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to drive strong cash flow conversion maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls drive improved efficiencies across the business and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including product innovation and new technologies global and market expansion aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as safety quality and ontime delivery 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and transit rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloads and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight and transit rail 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtecs products and services 

business update 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to impact our sales channels supply chain manufacturing operations workforce and other key aspects of our operations the company continues to monitor the situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities however there are numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic availability and effectiveness of vaccines impact of variants of the disease actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and private industry including preventing or curtailing the operations of our plants the potential impact on global economic activity global supply chain operations our employees our customers suppliers and endmarkets and other consequences that could negatively impact our business we also face the possibility that government policies may become more restrictive especially if covid19 transmission rates increase in certain areas as a result of these numerous uncertainties we are unable to specifically predict the extent and length of time the covid19 pandemic will negatively impact our business 

the covid19 pandemic has increased the uncertainty around global economic and market conditions which impacts our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause or exacerbate instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the materially adverse impacts that we have experienced as a result of the covid19 pandemic could continue or worsen in addition we face risks associated with our growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to address changes in market conditions and risks 

although the us and other international governments deemed rail transportation as “critical infrastructure” providing essential services during the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic had a materially adverse impact on our operations and business results for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 which is discussed in more detail in the results of operations section below supply chain disruptions and labor availability have caused component raw material and chip shortages resulting in an adverse effect on the timing of the company’s revenue generation additionally broadbased inflation escalation of metals and commodities costs transportation and logistics costs and labor costs have all resulted from the covid19 pandemic the company has implemented various mitigating actions to lessen the impact of supply chain disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic these actions include price escalations in longterm contracts implementing price surcharges driving operational efficiencies through various cost mitigation efforts and discretionary spend management 

strategic sourcing alignments and accelerating integration synergies where possible the company expects to continue to realize these increased costs over the next few quarters 

uncertainty around general global economic and market conditions exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic will have an impact on our sales and operations in 2022 and beyond to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets supply chain disruptions including shortages of raw materials or component parts labor availability longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

cybersecurity exposure 

during the third quarter 2021 one of our vendors publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in one of its operating systems that is used in a range of products across the rail sector and other industries including in certain wabtec products in response wabtec reviewed its digital onboard locomotive products and locomotive control systems to determine which products may be affected and the potential impact to wabtec our customers and other relevant parties to date we are unaware of any exploitation of these vulnerabilities however we are working closely with our vendor to appropriately address potentially impacted products additionally we have communicated with potentially affected customers and discussed mitigation strategies 

acquisitions 

wabtec acquired nordco a leading north american supplier of new rebuilt and used maintenance of way equipment on march 31 2021 and ge transportation a former business unit of ge on february 25 2019 for additional information related to these acquisitions refer to note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this report

net sales 

net sales for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 266 million or 35 to 782 billion compared to the same period in 2020 organic sales decreased 6 million which is primarily attributable to a net organic decrease of 4 million in the freight segment services sales increased from higher locomotive modernizations and overhauls and a decrease in locomotive parkings while components sales increased due to a higher railcar build and lower railcar parkings these increases were offset by lower equipment sales due to lower locomotive sales particularly in north america and egypt and lower digital electronics sales primarily due to chip shortages caused by supply chain disruptions these decreases in freight were 

offset by an increase in sales from acquisitions which contributed 138 million and favorable changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by 134 million primarily in the transit segment 

cost of sales 

cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 34 million or 06 to 545 billion compared to the same period in 2020 the increase is primarily due to the increase in sales increased metals transportation and labor costs and higher restructuring costs cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 697 and 717 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively representing a 20 percentage point decrease the decrease as a percentage of sales is primarily due to favorable product mix improved productivity synergy savings and the structural cost actions taken in the prior year partially offset by the increase in the costs described above cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2021 included 53 million of restructuring costs primarily for footprint rationalization and headcount actions in europe cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 included 45 million of restructuring costs primarily for footprint rationalization and related headcount actions as part of the acquisition of ge transportation and in response to the covid19 pandemic

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased 22 million for the year ended december 31 2021 over the same period in 2020 attributable to lower overall average debt balances and lower interest rates 

other income net 

other income net was 38 million of income in 2021 compared to 11 million of income in the same period of 2020 the increase is primarily attributable to foreign exchange gains in the current year compared to losses in the prior year as well as higher equity income in the current year 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 232 and 260 in 2021 and 2020 respectively the change in effective tax rate in 2021 is primarily the result of filing amended federal and state income tax returns in 2021 the company amended the 2019 federal tax return to incorporate changes in tax regulations which generated a net operating loss that was carried back to tax years 2014 to 2016 which were at a higher federal tax rate see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional information

cost of sales 

freight segment cost of sales decreased by 22 million to 357 billion compared to the same period in 2020 the decrease is primarily due to favorable product mix productivity and synergies and lower restructuring costs partially offset by increased metals transportation and labor costs cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 682 and 707 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively representing a 25 percentage point decrease which also benefited from improved absorption of fixed costs cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2021 includes 8 million of restructuring and transaction costs primarily for amortization of the inventory stepup recorded in purchase accounting for the acquisition of nordco and headcount actions as part of the ongoing integration of ge transportation cost of sales for the year ended december 31 2020 included 30 million of restructuring costs primarily for costs for footprint rationalization and related headcount actions as part of the integration of ge transportation and in response to the covid19 pandemic

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories business combinations the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves stock based compensation income taxes and revenue recognition management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of expected losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience relevant credit forecast information changes to customers solvency and other currently available evidence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our estimated losses we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts and loss of cash flows 

inventories 

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories and net realizable value reserves 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence a decline in market value or loss of a customer with specific inventory 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value or demand for our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring writedowns to adjust inventory value to a net realizable value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

business combinations 

description the company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with asc 805 business combinations which requires the purchase price of the acquired business to be allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the respective fair values the amount of purchase price which is in excess of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the fair values of acquired contract backlog customer relationships intellectual property intangibles and trade names and belowmarket customer contract liabilities the significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the intangible assets and belowmarket customer contract liabilities included revenue growth rates projected profit margins discount rates royalty rates customer attrition rates revenue obsolescence rates and market participant profit margins these significant assumptions are forwardlooking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions different assumptions may result in materially different values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed which may impact the companys financial position and future results of operations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the company has identified three reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment two reporting units exist within the freight segment and the transit segment is also a reporting unit the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations at december 31 2021 all three of the company’s reporting units had fair values which were substantially in excess of their carrying values  see note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

warranty reserves 

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for warranty expense 

stockbased compensation 

description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new threeyear performance cycle with the most recently completed cycle being 20192021 no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock units vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts upon the initial grant of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate from period to period 

income taxes 

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which new information changes the expected outcome of an uncertain tax position a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

revenue recognition 

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  company recognizes a portion of its revenues on longterm customer agreements involving the design and production of highly engineered products that require revenue to be recognized over time because these products have no alternative use without significant economic loss and the agreements contain an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin from the customer in the event of contract termination generally the company uses an input method for determining the amount of revenue cost and gross margin to recognize over time for these customer agreements the input methods used for these agreements include costs of material and labor both of which give an accurate representation of the progress made toward complete satisfaction of a particular performance obligation 

judgments and uncertainties accounting for longterm customer agreements involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages contract estimates related to longterm projects are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that could span several years these assumptions include cost of materials labor availability and productivity complexity of the work to be performed and the performance of suppliers customers and subcontracts that may be associated with the contract factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements generally pricing is defined in our contracts but may include an estimate of variable consideration when required by the terms of the individual customer contract types of variable consideration that the company typically has include volume discounts prompt payment discounts liquidating damages and performance bonuses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgments in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods some of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the global freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of freight railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization and growth in developing markets a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness increasing investment in technology solutions an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight rail and passenger transit 

according to the 2020 biannual edition of a market study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 120 billion and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 23 through 2025 as the longterm effects of covid19 are still uncertain unife included a second less likely scenario in which the recovery is more moderate this alternative scenario shows a compounded annual growth rate of 09 through 2025 for the total accessible market the three largest geographic markets which represented about 85 of the total accessible market were europe north america and asia pacific unife projected aboveaverage growth rates in latin america eastern europe north america and africamiddle east with the more mature markets of western europe north america and asia pacific accounting for the largest share of absolute growth unife said trends such as urbanization digitalization legislative action and government support and an increased focus on energy and environmental issues continue to drive investment the largest product segments of the market were rolling stock services and infrastructure which represent almost 90 of the accessible market unife projected spending growth in all product segments with turnkey management projects rolling stock and infrastructure to grow fastest unife estimated that the global installed base of diesel and electric locomotives was about 118200 units with about 32 in asia pacific about 25 in north america and about 18 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states wabtec estimates that about 3000 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2020 unife estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 52 million with about 35 in north america about 24 in russiacis and about 24 in asia pacific wabtec estimates that about 155000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2020 unife estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 620000 units with about 45 in asia pacific about 31 in europe and about 10 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 32000 new passenger transit vehicles were ordered worldwide in 2020 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental policies encourage continued investment in public mass transit and modal shift from car to rail although this growth may be stunted in the nearterm as a result of the covid19 pandemic according to unife germany france and the united kingdom were the largest western european transit markets representing about twothirds of industry spending in the european union unife projected the accessible western european rail market to grow at about 20 annually led by investments in new rolling stock in france and germany about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 19 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in recent years the european commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the european rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements unife believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 600 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 50 of total rail carloads with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems 

growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by continued investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets india is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system for example wabtec is delivering on a 1000unit locomotive contract with indian railways 

other key geographic markets include russiacis and africamiddle east with about 13 million freight cars and about 21000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives according to unife most emerging markets were expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems it is still uncertain as to how the covid19 pandemic will impact the expected growth in these emerging markets especially in the nearterm as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in its study unife also said it expected increased investment in digitalization automation and predictive maintenance through artificial intelligence all of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry unife expects these trends to increase the overall attractiveness of the rail sector as these trends are expected to lead to significant cost savings allowing rail to be more competitive in comparison to other modes of transportation wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

• iconic legacy and strong reputation with a history of over 150 years of innovation  the rail industry has been in operation for over 150 years and we have been at the forefront of shaping and transforming the rail landscape through various innovations and technologies dating back to 1869 and george westinghouse’s invention of the air brake we are an established leader in the rail industry for freight and passenger transit vehicles for over 110 years ge transportation has served the worldwide rail industry which is a critical component of the global transportation system and the global economy with an installed base of more than 22500 locomotives worldwide faiveley transport founded in 1919 has a long history and is a market leader for its core products including pantographs automatic door mechanisms and air conditioning systems we have leveraged our leading positions by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to supplying integrated parts and assemblies from a full locomotive through the end of the train we are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording measuring and communications systems positive train control equipment highly engineered compressors and heat exchangers for locomotives and a leading manufacturer of freight car components including electronic braking equipment draft gears trucks brake shoes and electronic endoftrain devices we are also a leading provider of braking equipment heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment door assemblies and platform screen doors lifts and ramps couplers and current collection equipment such as pantographs for passenger transit vehicles 

• breadth of product offering with a stable mix of original equipment market oem and aftermarket business  our product portfolio is one of the broadest in the rail industry as we offer a wide selection of quality parts components and assemblies across the entire train and worldwide we provide our products in both the original equipment market and the aftermarket our substantial installed base of products with endusers such as the railroads and the passenger transit authorities is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because these customers often look to purchase safety and performancerelated replacement parts from the original equipment components supplier in addition as oems and railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency these products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment in 2020 net sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 60 of total net sales 

• market leader with longstanding customer partnerships in a critical infrastructure sector for more than a century rail has been a cornerstone of the global transportation system and thus the economy rail remains one of the most costeffective energyefficient modes of transport both domestically and internationally as the largest global producer of dieselelectric locomotives we have a significant market share both in north america and globally 

• leading design and engineering capabilities  we believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and engineering practice which has assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment we believe both our customers and government authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to innovation as we seek not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous improvement of product performance the company designs develops and manufactures critical components and systems for the rail mining and marine industries which include proprietary propulsion systems engine platforms and controls technology these innovative and differentiated solutions serve as the building blocks for the rail mining and marine industries and help keep our global customers at the forefront of advancing technologies when coupled with our advanced digital analytic capabilities our solutions help drive increased energy management performance and reliability to our products to that end we have assembled a wide range of patented products which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

• leading the digital transformation of wabtec’s industries  our early investment in data analytics and software has allowed us to become a strategic partner for customers looking to derive new value from assets and digitally transform their operations through these initiatives the transportation industry from mine to port from shipper to receiver from port to intermodal terminals to main line locomotives and railcars and across train yards and operation centers has evolved to include digital solutions the breadth of our digital and electronic solutions gives customers confidence in our ability to address their current and future needs 

• experience with industry regulatory requirements  the freight rail and passenger transit industries are governed by various government agencies and regulators in each country and region these groups mandate rigorous manufacturer certification new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet costeffectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess certification processes are lengthy and often require local presence and expertise in addition each transit agency places a high degree of importance on vehicle customization which requires experience and technical expertise to meet everevolving specifications 

• streamlined cost structure and operational excellence provide operating leverage and support wabtec’s growth  wabtec’s lean manufacturing and continuous improvement initiatives have been a part of the company’s culture for 

more than 25 years and have enabled wabtec to manage successfully through cycles in the rail supply market we are continuing to expand our operating excellence focus in driving productivity and delighting customers our operating excellence program leverages the breadth and depth of our one wabtec expertise across the organization in sharing of best practice instilling a culture of learning problem solving continuous improvement and driving standard operating practices this coupled with our overall manufacturing and supply base footprint initiatives will drive increased flexibility and improved responsiveness to our customer needs while driving margin improvement through productivity 

business strategy 

we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs utilizing global sourcing and supply chain management these practices enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments we also rely on functional experts within the company across various disciplines to train coach and share best practices throughout the corporation while benchmarking against bestinclass competitors and peers over time we expect to continue to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

• product innovation and new technologies  we continue to emphasize innovation and development funding to create new products and capabilities such as the battery electric locomotive and vehicle monitoring and data analytics we have a multiyear initiative to build on our existing expertise and technologies in the digital and electronics areas in addition we invest in developing enhancements and new features to existing products such as brake discs and heat exchangers we are focusing on technological advances especially in the areas of electronics braking products and other onboard equipment as a means to deliver new product growth we seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits with costeffective investments 

• global and market expansion we believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth in 2020 net sales to nonus customers were approximately 44 billion we intend to increase international sales through direct sales of existing products to current and new customers by developing specific new products for application in new geographic markets by making strategic acquisitions and through joint ventures with railway suppliers which have a strong presence in their local markets in transit we are focused on mature markets such as europe and emerging markets such as india in freight we are targeting markets that operate significant fleets of usstyle locomotives and freight cars including australia brazil china india russia south africa and other select areas within europe and south america in addition we have opportunities to increase the sale of certain products that we currently manufacture for the rail industry into other industrial markets such as mining offhighway and energy these products include heat exchangers and friction materials 

• aftermarket products and services  historically aftermarket sales are less cyclical than oem sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance and service work must be performed even during an industry slowdown in 2020 net sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 60 of total net sales as a long time supplier of original equipment we have an extensive installed base of equipment in the field which generates recurring aftermarket sales wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its components and we seek to expand this business with customers who currently perform the work inhouse in this way we expect to benefit as transit authorities and railroads outsource certain maintenance and overhaul functions 

• acquisitions joint ventures and alliances  we continue to invest in acquisitions joint ventures and alliances using a disciplined selective approach and rigorous financial criteria these transactions are expected to meet our financial criteria and contribute to growth strategies of product innovation and new technologies global expansion and aftermarket products and services we believe these expansion strategies will help wabtec to grow profitably expand geographically and dampen the impact from potential cycles in the north american freight rail industry 

recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 5 of this report for additional information about our recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 216 billion at december 31 2020 for 2020 about 60 of total net sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not included in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages generally if a customer were to cancel a contract we would have an enforceable right to payment for work completed up to the date of cancellation which would include a reasonable profit margin substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or canceled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the rollforward of the companys backlog of firm customer orders and the expected year of completion are as follows 



the company saw no significant cancellations of backlog during the year ended december 31 2020 despite the unprecedented pandemic caused by covid19 and its effects on locomotive parkings carbuilds and transit ridership levels however the economic slowdown that was caused by covid19 did have some impact on the timing of orders in backlog as the delivery of goods and services previously expected to be completed in the current year has been pushed out to future years 

engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we invested 1621 million 2099 million and 875 million respectively on product development and improvement activities significant incremental engineering expense is incurred with the execution of original equipment customer contracts across the corporation we have established multiple centers of competence which have specialized technical expertise in various disciplines and product areas 

our engineering and development program includes investments in data analytics train control and other new technologies with an emphasis on developing products that enhance safety productivity and efficiency for our customers for example we have developed advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other industry suppliers 

we use our product development system to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have about 6000 active patents worldwide and on average file for approximately 300 new patents each year we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property we also follow the product development practices of our competitors to monitor any possible patent infringement by them and to evaluate their strategies and plans 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key 

japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees are beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

we provide products and services for more than 500 customers worldwide our customers include passenger transit authorities and railroads throughout north america europe asia pacific south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars passenger transit vehicles and buses and companies that own lease and maintain such equipment 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 our top five customers accounted for approximately 24 of net sales no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated net sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally although market shares vary by product lines and geographies we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines and geographies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall original equipment manufacturer oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel a division of caterpillar and knorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america knorr is our main competitor although not in every product line or geography in addition our competitors often include smaller local suppliers in most international markets depending on the product line and geography we can also compete with our customers such as crrc corporation limited a chinabased manufacturer of rolling stock

we provide our employees resources to help them succeed we offer a wide range of benefits including healthcare and wellness benefits retirement benefits an employee assistance program employee resource groups to build diverse communities at wabtec and paid time off 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the us and around the world these entities typically govern equipment safety and interoperability standards for freight rail rolling stock and passenger transit oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers new products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy as a result of these regulations and requirements we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries the governing bodies include the fra and the association of american railroads aar in the us and the international union of railways “uic” and the european railway agencies in europe also in europe the european committees for standardization continually draft new european standards which cover for example the reliability availability maintainability and safety of railways systems to guarantee interoperability in europe the european union for railway agencies is responsible for defining and implementing technical standards of interoperability which covers areas such as infrastructure energy rolling stock telematic applications traffic operation and management subsystems noise pollution and waste generation protection against fire and smoke and system safety 

most countries and regions in which wabtec does business have similar rulemaking bodies in russia a gostr certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals in russian territory in china any product or system sold on the chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards in the local indian market most products are covered by regulations patterned after aar and uic standards 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal third quarter results may be affected by the timing of services performed under our locomotive maintenance contracts and vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers fourth quarter results may be affected by the timing of spare parts and service orders placed by transit agencies worldwide quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays

 item 1a risk factors tableend

risks related to our business and operations 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result customer order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations furthermore the average service life of certain products in our end markets has increased in recent years due to innovations in technologies and manufacturing processes which has also allowed end users to replace parts less often as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a global competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do may have a more extensive lowcost sourcing strategy and presence in lowcost regions than we do or may receive significant governmental support price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers with significant negotiating power has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support if our competitors invest heavily in innovation and develop products that are more efficient or effective than our products we may not be able to compete effectively there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our existing products or to react appropriately to changes in demand we may experience delayed product shipments and customer dissatisfaction if demand increases significantly from current 

levels both we and our suppliers may have difficulty meeting such demand particularly if such demand increases occur rapidly alternatively we may carry excess inventory if demand for our products decreases below projected levels 

additionally we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors furthermore we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

failure to accurately predict and react to customer demand could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to respond adequately or in a timely manner to innovative changes in new technology 

in recent years the global transportation landscape has been characterized by rapid changes in technology leading to innovative transportation and logistics concepts that could change the way the railway industry does business there may be additional innovations impacting the railway industry that we cannot yet foresee any failure by us to quickly adapt to and adopt new innovations in products and processes desired by our customers may result in a significant loss of demand for our product and service offerings in addition advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical and is influenced by a variety of factors new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced by a variety of factors including major replacement programs the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities and the quality and cost of alternative modes of transportation to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or canceled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

equipment failures interruptions delays in deliveries or extensive damage to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

all of our facilities equipment supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as disease outbreak fires earthquakes explosions floods tornadoes hurricanes or weather conditions an interruption in our manufacturing capabilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems whether as a result of such catastrophic loss or any other reason could reduce prevent or delay our production and shipment of our product offerings result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses this could result in the delay or termination of orders the loss of future sales and a negative impact to our reputation with our customers 

thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to such matters will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses any of these risks coming to fruition could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to make move and sell our products is critical to our success damage or disruption to our supply chain including thirdparty manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of disruptions or to effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location could adversely affect our business or financial results due to the ongoing impacts and uncertainty of continued impacts of the covid19 pandemic and the global government actions to contain it some of our supply chains particularly in china india and europe have been and continue to be impacted there can be no assurance that there will not be further or deeper supply chain disruptions or that the steps we are taking to mitigate such disruptions will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion 

in addition disputes with significant suppliers including disputes regarding pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

• difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies including the integration of operations services and products 

• diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the assumption of unknown liabilities and 

• unanticipated changes in the market conditions business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition joint venture or alliance 

we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify or consummate suitable acquisitions joint ventures or alliances we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in such strategic transactions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement this strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

although we believe that our recent acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

• the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results 

• significant expenses to integrate 

• diversion of management’s attention from business operations to integration matters 

• departure of key personnel from the acquired business 

• effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decisionmaking 

• integration of different information systems 

• unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities and 

• impairment of assets 

the effects of covid19 and other potential future public health crises epidemics pandemics or similar events on our business operating results and cash flows are uncertain 

we face a wide variety of risks related to health epidemics pandemics and similar outbreaks including the global outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 since first reported in late 2019 the covid19 pandemic has 

dramatically impacted the global health and economic environment including millions of confirmed cases business slowdowns or shutdowns government challenges and market volatility of an unprecedented nature although we have to date managed to continue most of our operations we cannot predict the future course of events nor can we assure that this global pandemic including its economic impact will not have a material adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows the extent of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on future pandemic related developments including the duration of the pandemic any potential subsequent waves of covid19 and new strains of the virus the effectiveness distribution and acceptance of covid19 vaccines and related government actions to prevent and manage disease spread all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted our operations may be further impacted by the covid19 pandemic if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines travel restrictions or absenteeism steps the company has taken to protect health and wellbeing government actions facility closures work slowdowns or stoppages inadequate supplies or resources such as reliable personal protective equipment testing and vaccines or other circumstances related to covid19 governments around the world have taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe anticipated economic effects but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in operational and supply chain disruptions for us and our customers and may further adversely affect operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers accordingly covid19 had a materially adverse impact on our operations and business results for the year ended december 31 2020 and we expect covid19 to continue to have a materially adverse impact on our operations and business results into 2021 the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices and to implement significant proactive measures to protect the health and safety of employees and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are appropriate under the circumstances there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the continued risks posed by the pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic and related volatility in financial markets and deterioration of national and global economic conditions could affect our business and operations in a variety of ways for example we have experienced and could experience further operational disruptions and financial losses as a result of the following 

• a decrease in demand for our products as a result of covid19 and cost control measures implemented by our customers 

• delays in orders or delivery of orders the occurrence of which negatively impacts our cash conversion cycle and ability to convert our backlog into cash 

• inability to collect full or partial payments from customers due to deterioration in customer liquidity including customer bankruptcies 

• a shutdown of one or multiple of our manufacturing facilities due to government restrictions or illness in connection with covid19 

the continued spread of covid19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which depending on future developments may make it more costly or difficult for us to obtain debt or equity financing including to refinance our existing debt or to identify or execute on investment opportunities in each case on terms and within time periods acceptable to us we are also monitoring the impacts of covid19 on the fair value of our assets while we do not currently anticipate any material impairments on our assets as a result of covid19 future changes in expectations for sales earnings and cash flows related to intangible assets and goodwill below our current projections could cause these assets to be impaired 

we continue to work with our stakeholders including customers employees suppliers and local communities in an effort to address responsibly this global pandemic we continue to monitor the situation to assess further possible implications to our employees business supply chain and customers and to take certain actions in an effort to mitigate various adverse consequences 

we expect that the longer the covid19 pandemic including its economic disruption continues the greater the adverse impact on our business operations financial performance and results of operations could be given the tremendous uncertainties and variables we cannot at this time predict the impact of the global covid19 pandemic or any future pandemic but any one could have a material adverse impact on our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows 

risks related to international operations 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 approximately 58 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the united states we intend to continue to expand our international operations including in emerging markets in the future our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france and we conduct other international operations 

through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures including in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland russia spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

• lack of complete operating control 

• lack of local business experience 

• currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations 

• restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital 

• the complexities of operating within multiple tax jurisdictions 

• foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls 

• adverse impacts of international trade policies such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs 

• difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights 

• the challenges of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments 

• the difficulties involved in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• economic political and social instability 

• possible local catastrophes such as natural disasters and epidemics and 

• possible terrorist attacks conflicts and wars including those against american interests 

our exposure to the risks associated with international operations may intensify if our international operations expand in the future 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn and report revenues and vice versa in addition a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from nonus operations and the translated value of the net assets of our nonus operations when reported in us dollars in our consolidated financial statements we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we have substantial operations located in emerging markets and are subject to regulatory economic social and political uncertainties in such markets 

we have substantial operations located in emerging markets such as brazil india kazakhstan the russian federation and ukraine operations in such emerging markets are inherently risky due to a number of regulatory economic social and political uncertainties these risks include economies that may be dependent on only a few products and are therefore subject to significant fluctuations weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights possible exchange controls unstable governments nationalization or privatization actions or other government actions affecting the flow of goods and currency 

significant changes in economic and regulatory policy in emerging countries as well as social or political uncertainties could significantly harm business and economic conditions in these markets generally and could disproportionately impact the rail industry which could adversely affect our business and prospects in these markets 

in addition physical and financial infrastructure may be less developed in some emerging countries than that of many developed nations any disruptions with respect to banking and financial infrastructure communication systems or any public facility including transportation infrastructure could disrupt our normal business activity such disruptions could interrupt our business operations and significantly harm our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

risks related to macroeconomic conditions and policies 

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally particularly in our key end markets could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we may be exposed to raw material shortages supply shortages and fluctuations in raw material energy and commodity prices 

we purchase energy steel aluminum copper rubber and rubberbased materials chemicals polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources and traditionally have not had longterm pricing contracts with our pure raw material suppliers the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers experience a lag in our ability to pass increases to our customers or operational efficiencies are not achieved our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our businesses compete globally for key production inputs in addition we rely upon thirdparty suppliers including certain singlesourced suppliers for various components for our products in the event of a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs we may experience challenges sourcing certain of our components to meet our production requirements and may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of certain raw materials or key inputs any such shortage may materially adversely affect our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs 

changes to international trade policies including tariffs and foreign trade restrictions could adversely affect our business 

as a global transportation company we generate export sales from our us operations and also derive international sales through our foreign subsidiaries licensees and joint ventures we also do business with industry suppliers located in various international markets a protectionist trade environment in either the united states or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may adversely affect our business in particular such policies may impact or delay our customers investments in our products reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain markets and inhibit our ability to costeffectively purchase necessary inputs from certain suppliers in addition to the extent developments in international trade relations result in reduced global trade or slower growth in global trade it is likely that this would result in reductions in investment in freight and transit rail 

international trade policies are affected by a diverse array of factors including global and national economic and political conditions which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions although we actively monitor developments in international trade and proactively engage in efforts to mitigate the effect of trade policies there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be successful 

legal and regulatory risks 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including anticorruption laws in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to various laws rules and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions in which we do business such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act the french law n° 20161691 sapin ii and the uk bribery act relating to our business and our employees we are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations including regulations administered by the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security the us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control and various nonus government entities including applicable export control regulations economic sanctions on countries and persons customs requirements currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations despite our policies procedures and compliance programs our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect us from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could damage our reputation subject us to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt our business and as a result could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition our manufacturing operations are subject to safety operations maintenance and mechanical standards rules and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations both domestically and internationally our business may be adversely impacted by new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules or regulations which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of certain of our products or could make such products obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to their useful lives we are unable to predict what impact these or other regulatory changes may have if any on our business or the industry as a whole we cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with any new standards or regulations will not be material to our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water substances in products the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we have incurred and will continue to incur both operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations including costs associated with the cleanup and investigation of some of our current and former properties and offsite disposal locations we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have significant consequences on our business and results of operations including the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations injunctive relief including requirements that we limit or cease operations at affected facilities and reputational risk 

in addition certain of our products are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent statutory and regulatory requirements governing eg  emissions and noise including standards imposed by the us environmental protection agency the european union and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures relating to compliance with these standards the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of these standardsparticularly in emerging marketsare unpredictable and subject to change 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the potential challenges posed by evolving climate change policy and prospective legislation are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry while we are carefully monitoring developments and reviewing the challenges associated with alternative proposals at this time we cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on our operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until legislative policy is more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

the occurrence of litigation in which we are or could be named as a defendant is unpredictable 

from time to time we are subject directly or through our subsidiaries to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business customers suppliers creditors stockholders product liability including asbestos claims intellectual property infringement competition and antitrust claims warranty claims or environmentalrelated matters 

due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all in addition although in some cases we may be indemnified by nonaffiliated entities that retain liabilities in connection with specific matters there can be no assurance that these indemnitors will remain financially viable and capable of satisfying their obligations 

any litigation even a claim without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

risks related to data security and intellectual property 

if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we may be adversely affected 

our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely primarily on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and unfair competition laws as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights however filing prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive moreover existing us legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights as a result a significant portion of our technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology further although we routinely conduct anticounterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions we have encountered counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights counterfeit components of low quality may negatively impact our brand value accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon counterfeiting or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights then our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

in addition we operate in industries in which there are many thirdparty owners of intellectual property rights owners of intellectual property that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable third party intellectual property owners may assert infringement claims against us based on their intellectual property portfolios if we are sued for intellectual property infringement we may incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims even if we prevail 

we face cybersecurity and data protection risks relating to cyber attacks and information technology failures that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on information technology in our business we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information including proprietary business information personal data and other information that may be subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed data protection controls we also provide technological products integral to train operation accordingly our business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to our own or thirdparty information technology infrastructure which could result from individual or highlycoordinated cyber attacks including but not limited to data theft system breaches malfeasance or improper use or unauthorized access to it systems our business may also be adversely impacted by unintentional technology disruptions including those resulting from programming errors employee operational errors and software defects 

risks related to human capital 

labor shortages and labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we depend on skilled labor in our manufacturing and other businesses due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate we may not be able to retain recruit and train the personnel we require particularly when the economy expands production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases 

we collectively bargain with labor unions at some of our operations throughout the world failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations furthermore nonunion employees in certain countries have the right to strike if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel 

any such labor shortages or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

we rely on our management team and other key personnel 

we depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team and other key employees in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results if we lose key personnel because they terminate their employment or retire or as a result of illness disability or death or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teams attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key personnel that we lose or 

we may not be able to hire potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2020 we had total debt of 42 billion including 35 billion related to senior notes and 07 billion related to term loans and amounts drawn under our revolving loan facility in each case under the senior credit facility being indebted could have important consequences to us for example our indebtedness could 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we operate 

• place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt and 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds 

the indentures for our outstanding senior notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

our credit agreement subjects us to customary i affirmative covenants including requirements with respect to certain reporting obligations on us and our subsidiaries and ii negative covenants including limitations on indebtedness liens restricted payments fundamental changes including certain changes in control business activities transactions with affiliates restrictive agreements changes in fiscal year and use of proceeds in addition we are required to maintain i a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 300 to 100 over each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter and ii a leverage ratio calculated as of the last day of a fiscal quarter for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of 325 to 100 or less provided that in connection with the acquisition of ge transportation and in the event of any further material acquisition in which the cash consideration to be paid exceeds 5000 million the maximum leverage ratio permitted adjusts to x 375 to 100 at the end of the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition is consummated and each of the three fiscal quarters immediately following such fiscal quarter and y 350 to 100 at the end of each of the fourth and fifth full fiscal quarters after the consummation of such acquisition 

the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain covenants and restrictions which limit subject to certain exceptions certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties the incurrence of secured debt without equally and ratably securing the senior notes and certain merger and consolidation transactions in addition the indentures require that we offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events

covid19 update 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization designated the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus known as covid19 as a global pandemic governments and businesses around the world have taken unprecedented actions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including but not limited to shelterinplace orders quarantines significant restrictions on travel as well as restrictions that prohibit many employees from going to work our top concern is and remains the health and wellbeing of our employees around the world to date covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and has impacted our sales channels supply chain manufacturing operations workforce and other key aspects of our operations the outbreak and preventive measures taken to help curb the spread including temporary plant closures in china india italy and other countries where outbreaks and stayathome orders were most prevalent had an adverse impact on our operations and business results for the year ended december 31 2020 

we continue to monitor the situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations however there are numerous uncertainties including the duration and severity of the pandemic availability and effectiveness of vaccines actions that may be taken by governmental authorities and private industry including preventing or curtailing the operations of our plants the potential impact on global economic activity global supply chain operations our employees our customers supplier and endmarkets and other consequences that could negatively impact our business we also face the possibility that government policies may become more restrictive especially if covid19 transmission rates increase in certain areas as a result of these numerous uncertainties we are unable to specifically predict the extent and length of time the covid19 pandemic will negatively impact our business covid19 had a materially adverse impact on our operations and business results for the yearended december 31 2020 which is discussed in the results of operations section below and we expect covid19 to continue to have a materially adverse impact on our operations and business results into 2021 the future adverse impact may include reduced demand for our products reduced cash from operations and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in earnings mix across the company’s different jurisdictions we continue to work with our employees customers and suppliers to navigate the impacts of covid19 we also continue to assess possible implications to our business customers supply chain and endmarkets and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to drive strong cash flow conversion maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls drive improved efficiencies across the business and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including product innovation and new technologies global and market expansion aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and transit rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloads and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight and transit rail 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtecs products and services 

in 2021 and beyond general global economic and market conditions will have an impact on our sales and operations the covid19 pandemic has increased the uncertainty around global economic and market conditions to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to address changes in market conditions and risks

wabtec acquired ge transportation a former business unit of ge on february 25 2019 for additional information related to this acquisition refer to note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this report 

results of operations 

consolidated results 

2020 compared to 2019 

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 



the following table shows the major components of the change in net sales in 2020 from 2019 



results of operations were negatively impacted during the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic management’s discussion below includes analysis as to the impact of the covid19 pandemic where it could be explicitly identified however in many instances it is difficult to quantify with a high level of certainty the negative impact the covid19 pandemic had on our results of operations 

the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december 31 2020 to the year ended december 31 2019 the discussion comparing our results for the year ended december 31 2019 to the year ended december 31 2018 is included within managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on february 24 2020 

net sales 

net sales decreased by 644 million or 79 to 7556 million the decrease is primarily attributable to an organic decrease of 833 million in the freight segment due to lower locomotive equipment sales lower sales in components from a 

reduction of freight carbuilds in 2020 compared to 2019 a decrease in services sales due to lower freight rail volumes and an increase in parking of locomotives particularly in north america the lower freight rail volumes and increased parking of locomotives is partially due to the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the economy the transit segment experienced an organic decrease in sales of 307 million primarily due to covid19 related production delays and reduced passenger traffic the decrease is partially offset by sales from acquisitions of 546 million mainly the acquisition of ge transportation unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced net sales by 50 million 

cost of sales 

cost of sales decreased by 503 million to 5419 million in 2020 compared to 5922 million in 2019 the decrease is primarily due to the sales decreases discussed above cost of sales in 2020 includes 44 million of restructuring costs primarily for footprint rationalization and related headcount reductions as part of the ongoing integration actions related to the ge transportation acquisition and in response to the covid19 pandemic cost of sales in 2019 included a 185 million charge related to purchase price accounting for the stepup of ge transportation inventory and 38 million of restructuring costs primarily for footprint rationalization and related headcount actions excluding these charges in both years cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 711 in 2020 and 695 in 2019 representing a 16 increase the increase can be attributed to an unfavorable sales mix lower absorption of overhead costs due to the decrease in sales volumes increased parking of locomotives and lower rail passenger traffic this was partially offset by increased synergy savings related to the ge transportation acquisition and actions taken to reduce costs in response to the covid19 pandemic 

operating expenses 

total operating expenses decreased 222 million to 184 of net sales in 2020 compared to 197 in 2019 restructuring and transaction costs primarily for headcount actions and costs related to acquisition of ge transportation included in sga were 71 million and 192 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively additionally sga expenses decreased 155 million related to the acquisition synergy savings reduced employee benefit costs cost reduction initiatives and lower sales volumes partially offset by 57 million of incremental expense from acquisitions engineering expense decreased 48 million due to cost control measures on research and development projects partially offset by incremental expense from acquisitions amortization expense increased 44 million due to the acquisition of ge transportation 

interest expense net 

interest expense net decreased 20 million in the 2020 over the same period in 2019 attributable to lower variable interest rates and lower overall average debt balances in 2020 

other income expense net 

other expense net was 12 million of income in 2020 compared to 3 million of income in the same period of 2019 the variance is primarily driven by lower foreign exchange losses in the current year and an increase in income from equity method investments 

income taxes 

the effective income tax rate was 260 and 269 in 2020 and 2019 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate in 2020 is primarily the result of nondeductible transaction related expenses incurred during 2019 as a result of the ge transportation acquisition that did not recur in 2020 and a decrease in the estimated liabilities resulting from provisions of the tax cuts and jobs act that were recognized in 2019 

freight segment

the following table shows the major components of the change in net sales for the freight segment in 2020 from 2019 



net sales 

freight segment sales decreased by 359 million or 66 to 5082 million primarily due to an organic decrease of 833 million due to lower locomotive equipment sales lower sales in components from a reduction of freight carbuilds in 2020 compared to 2019 and a decrease in services sales due to lower freight rail volumes and an increase in parking of locomotives particularly in north america the lower freight rail volumes and increased parking of locomotives is partially due to the covid19 pandemic and its impact on the economy these decreases were partially offset by sales from acquisitions of 543 million primarily related to ge transportation unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by 69 million 

cost of sales 

freight segment cost of sales decreased by 266 million to 3594 million in 2020 the decrease is attributable to the organic sales decrease discussed above partially offset by 391 million of incremental cost of sales from acquisitions mainly the acquisition of ge transportation included in cost of sales in 2020 is 30 million of restructuring costs primarily for costs for footprint rationalization and related headcount actions as part of the ongoing integration actions related to the ge transportation acquisition and in response to the covid19 pandemic cost of sales in 2019 includes a 185 million charge related to purchase price accounting for the stepup of ge transportation inventory and 34 million of restructuring costs primarily for costs for footprint rationalization and related headcount reductions to integrate our combined businesses excluding these charges cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 701 in 2020 and 669 in 2019 representing a 32 percentage point increase the increase can be attributed to an unfavorable sales mix and lower absorption of overhead costs due to the decrease in organic sales volumes partially offset by increased synergy savings related to the ge transportation acquisition and efforts to reduce costs in response to the covid19 pandemic

freight segment operating expenses decreased 34 million or 36 in 2020 to 178 of sales restructuring and transaction costs primarily for headcount actions and costs related to acquisition of ge transportation included in sga were 46 million and 33 million for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively sga expenses excluding restructuring and transaction costs in both years decreased 116 million primarily due to synergy savings a reduction in employee benefit costs and lower sales volumes partially offset by 56 million in incremental expense from acquisitions primarily ge transportation additionally engineering expense decreased 32 million due to cost control measures on research and development projects partially offset by incremental expense from acquisitions amortization expense increased 44 million due to the acquisition of ge transportation 

transit segment 

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for our transit segment 



the following table shows the major components of the change in net sales for the transit segment in 2020 from 2019 



net sales 

transit segment net sales decreased by 285 million or 103 primarily due to disruptions to our operations caused by the covid19 pandemic particularly in asia and europe this impact was felt in both the original equipment manufacturing and aftermarket product lines as the pandemic lead to shutdowns that affected factory output and ridership levels favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes increased net sales by 19 million 

cost of sales

operating expenses 

transit segment operating expenses decreased 63 million to 419 million or 129 in 2020 to 170 of net sales sga expenses decreased 47 million in 2020 primarily due to lower sales and cost saving initiatives put in place to offset the adverse impact of covid19 and reduced employee benefit costs sga included restructuring charges mainly for severance of 14 million and 13 million for the year ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively engineering expense decreased 16 million due to cost savings measures put in place as a result of the covid19 pandemic and amortization expense remained consistent year over year the combination of improved operational performance and cost saving initiatives mentioned above have resulted in a 200 basis point operating margin improvement in 2020 from 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is provided by operating cash flow and borrowings under the company’s senior notes and unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks the following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data 



  operating activities  cash provided by operations in 2020 was 784 million compared with 1016 million in 2019 in comparison to 2019 cash provided by operations decreased due to an unfavorable change in other assets and liabilities of 492 million primarily due to the timing of payments related to accrued expenses including litigation settlements unfavorable change in accounts payable of 125 million due to the timing of payments to suppliers an unfavorable change in accrued liabilities and customer deposits of 80 million primarily related to the timing of accrued compensation payments and an unfavorable change in inventory of 75 million  these unfavorable changes were offset by higher net income of 86 million a favorable change in noncash items of 35 million related primarily to increased depreciation and amortization as a result of the acquisition of ge transportation and a favorable change in accounts receivable of 321 million due to improved collections and the acceleration of collections due to the newly implemented revolving receivable program

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories business combinations the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves stock based compensation income taxes and revenue recognition management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of expected losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience relevant credit forecast information changes to customers solvency and other currently available evidence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our estimated losses we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories 

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories and net realizable value reserves 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence a decline in market value or loss of a customer with specific inventory 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value or demand for of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring writedowns to adjust inventory value to a net realizable value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

business combinations 

description the company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with asc 805 business combinations which requires the purchase price of the acquired business to be allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the respective fair values the amount of purchase price which is in excess of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the fair values of acquired contract backlog customer relationships intellectual property intangibles and belowmarket customer contract liabilities the significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the intangible assets and belowmarket customer contract liabilities included revenue growth rates projected profit margins discount rates royalty rates customer attrition rates revenue obsolescence rates and market participant profit margins these significant assumptions are forwardlooking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions different assumptions may result in materially different values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed which may impact the companys financial position and future results of operations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the company has identified three reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment two reporting units exist within the freight segment and the transit segment is also a reporting unit the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations for example based on the quantitative analysis performed as of october 1 2020 a decline in the terminal growth rate by 100 basis points would decrease fair market value by 1218 million or an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by 2031 million even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values at december 31 2020 all three of the company’s reporting units had fair values which were substantially in excess of their carrying values  see note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

warranty reserves 

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for warranty expense 

stockbased compensation 

description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new threeyear performance cycle with the most recently completed cycle being 20182020 no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock units vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts upon the initial grant of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate from period to period for example a 10 decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stockbased compensation expense by approximately 25 million 

income taxes 

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which new information changes the expected outcome of an uncertain tax position a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

revenue recognition 

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” company recognizes a portion of its revenues on longterm customer agreements involving the design and production of highly engineered products that require revenue to be recognized over time because these products have no alternative use without significant economic loss and the agreements contain an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin from the customer in the event of contract termination generally the company uses an input method for determining the amount of revenue cost and gross margin to recognize over time for these customer agreements the input methods used for these agreements include costs of material and labor both of which give an accurate representation of the progress made toward complete satisfaction of a particular performance obligation 

judgments and uncertainties accounting for longterm customer agreements involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages contract estimates related to longterm projects are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that could span several years these assumptions include cost of materials labor availability and productivity complexity of the work to be performed and the performance of suppliers customers and subcontracts that may be associated with the contract factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements generally pricing is defined in our contracts but may include an estimate of variable consideration when required by the terms of the individual customer contract types of 

variable consideration that the company typically has include volume discounts prompt payment discounts liquidating damages and performance bonuses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgments in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods some of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts

general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 30 isabella street in pittsburgh pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccorpcom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries george westinghouse founded the original westinghouse air brake co in 1869 when he invented the air brake westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” the company went public on the new york stock exchange in 1995 

throughout the years the company has made a number of strategic acquisitions leading the company to where it is today these have primarily included 

• the 1999 merger with motivepower industries inc whereby the company adopted its current name of westinghouse air brake technologies corporation or wabtec 

• the 2017 acquisition of faiveley transport sa “faiveley transport” a leading provider of valueadded integrated systems and services primarily for the global transit rail market based in france the faiveley transport business has roots to 1919 and made wabtec a leader in manufacturing pantographs automatic door mechanisms air conditioning systems railway braking systems and couplers and 

• the 2019 merger with ge transportation a business unit of general electric company this brought a global technology leader and supplier of locomotives equipment services and digital solutions to the rail mining marine stationary power and drilling industries into wabtec 

as a result of the aforementioned acquisitions as well as other smaller acquisitions and organic growth wabtec is now one of the world’s largest providers of locomotives valueadded technologybased equipment systems and services for the global freight rail and passenger transit industries with over 27500 employees and operations in over 50 countries we believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and efficiency and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on a large percentage of locomotives freight cars passenger transit cars and buses around the world in 2019 the company had net sales of approximately 82 billion and net income attributable to our shareholders of about 327 million in 2019 net sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 55 of total net sales while net sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 60 of total net sales 

through both internal growth as well as acquisitions wabtec has positioned itself with the following strategic benefits

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the global freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of freight railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization and growth in developing markets a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness increasing investment in technology solutions an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight rail and passenger transit 

according to the 2018 biannual edition of a market study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services was more than 100 billion and was expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 26 through 2023 the three largest geographic markets which represented about 80 of the total accessible market were europe north america and asia pacific unife projected aboveaverage growth rates in north america latin america and africamiddle east with asia pacific and europe growing at about the industry average unife said trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support continue to drive investment the largest product segments of the market were rolling stock services and infrastructure which represent almost 90 of the accessible market unife projected spending on turnkey management projects and infrastructure to grow at aboveaverage rates unife estimated that the global installed base of diesel and electric locomotives was about 114800 units with about 33 in asia pacific about 26 in north america and about 18 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states wabtec estimates that about 2900 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2019 unife estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 51 million with about 33 in north america about 26 in asia pacific and about 24 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 174000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2019 unife estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 600000 units with about 45 in asia pacific about 33 in europe and about 12 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 35000 new passenger transit vehicles were ordered worldwide in 2019 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental policies encourage continued investment in public mass transit and modal shift from car to rail according to unife france germany and the united kingdom were the largest western european transit markets representing almost twothirds of industry spending in the european union unife projected the accessible western european rail market to grow at about 23 annually led by investments in new rolling stock in france and germany about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in recent years the european commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the european rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements unife believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 50 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems 

growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets india is 

making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system for example the country has awarded a 1000unit locomotive order to ge transportation 

other key geographic markets include russiacis and africamiddle east with about 12 million freight cars and about 20000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives according to unife emerging markets were expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in its study unife also said it expected increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management and in rail control technologies both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry unife said datadriven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

• iconic legacy and strong reputation with a history of over 150 years of innovation  the rail industry has been in operation for over 150 years and we have been at the forefront of shaping and transforming the rail landscape through various innovations and technologies dating back to 1869 and george westinghouse’s invention of the air brake we are an established leader in the rail industry for freight and passenger transit vehicles for over 110 years ge transportation has served the worldwide rail industry which is a critical component of the global transportation system and the global economy with an installed base of more than 22500 locomotives worldwide faiveley transport founded in 1919 has a long history and is a market leader for its core products including pantographs automatic door mechanisms and air conditioning systems we have leveraged our leading positions by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to supplying integrated parts and assemblies from a full locomotive through the end of the train we are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording measuring and communications systems positive train control equipment highly engineered compressors and heat exchangers for locomotives and a leading manufacturer of freight car components including electronic braking equipment draft gears trucks brake shoes and electronic endoftrain devices we are also a leading provider of braking equipment heating ventilation and air conditioning equipment door assemblies and platform screen doors lifts and ramps couplers and current collection equipment such as pantographs for passenger transit vehicles 

• breadth of product offering with a stable mix of original equipment market oem and aftermarket business  our product portfolio is one of the broadest in the rail industry as we offer a wide selection of quality parts components and assemblies across the entire train and worldwide we provide our products in both the original equipment market and the aftermarket our substantial installed base of products with endusers such as the railroads and the passenger transit authorities is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because these customers often look to purchase safety and performancerelated replacement parts from the original equipment components supplier in addition as oems and railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency these products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment in 2019 net sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 55 of total net sales 

• market leader with longstanding customer partnerships in a critical infrastructure sector for more than a century rail has been a cornerstone of the global transportation system and thus the economy rail remains one of the most costeffective energyefficient modes of transport both domestically and internationally as the largest global producer of dieselelectric locomotives we have a significant market share both in north america and globally 

• leading design and engineering capabilities  we believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and engineering practice which has assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment we believe both our customers and government authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to innovation as we seek not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous improvement of product performance the company designs develops and manufactures critical components and systems for the rail mining and marine industries which include proprietary propulsion systems engine platforms and controls technology these innovative and differentiated solutions serve as the building blocks for the rail mining and marine industries and help keep our global customers at the forefront of advancing technologies when coupled with our advanced digital analytic capabilities our solutions help drive increased energy management performance and reliability to our products to that end we have assembled a wide range of patented products which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 

• leading the digital transformation of wabtec’s industries  our early investment in data analytics and software has allowed us to become a strategic partner for customers looking to derive new value from assets and digitally transform their operations through these initiatives the transportation industry from mine to port from shipper to receiver from port to intermodal terminals to main line locomotives and railcars and across train yards and operation centers has 

evolved to include digital solutions the breadth of our digital and electronic solutions gives customers confidence in our ability to address their current and future needs 

• experience with industry regulatory requirements  the freight rail and passenger transit industries are governed by various government agencies and regulators in each country and region these groups mandate rigorous manufacturer certification new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet costeffectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess certification processes are lengthy and often require local presence and expertise in addition each transit agency places a high degree of importance on vehicle customization which requires experience and technical expertise to meet everevolving specifications 

• streamlined cost structure and operational excellence provide operating leverage and support wabtec’s growth  wabtec’s lean manufacturing and continuous improvement initiatives known as the wabtec excellence program wep have been a part of the company’s culture for more than 25 years and have enabled wabtec to manage successfully through cycles in the rail supply market building on our legacy wep program we are continuing to expand our operating excellence focus to also include industry 40 as an additional lever in driving productivity and delighting customers our operating excellence program leverages the breath and depth of our one wabtec expertise across the organization in sharing of best practice instilling a culture of learning problem solving continuous improvement and driving standard operating practices this coupled with our overall manufacturing and supply base footprint initiatives will drive increased flexibility and improved responsiveness to our customer needs while driving margin improvement through productivity 

business strategy 

we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs utilizing global sourcing and supply chain management these practices enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments we also rely on functional experts within the company across various disciplines to train coach and share best practices throughout the corporation while benchmarking against bestinclass competitors and peers over time we expect to continue to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

• product innovation and new technologies  we continue to emphasize innovation and development funding to create new products and capabilities such as vehicle monitoring and data analytics we have a multiyear initiative to build on our existing expertise and technologies in the digital and electronics areas in addition we invest in developing enhancements and new features to existing products such as brake discs and heat exchangers we are focusing on technological advances especially in the areas of electronics braking products and other onboard equipment as a means to deliver new product growth we seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits with costeffective investments 

• global and market expansion we believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth in 2019 net sales to nonus customers were approximately 48 billion we intend to increase international sales through direct sales of existing products to current and new customers by developing specific new products for application in new geographic markets by making strategic acquisitions and through joint ventures with railway suppliers which have a strong presence in their local markets in transit we are focused on mature markets such as europe and emerging markets such as india in freight we are targeting markets that operate significant fleets of usstyle locomotives and freight cars including australia brazil china india russia south africa and other select areas within europe and south america in addition we have opportunities to increase the sale of certain products that we currently manufacture for the rail industry into other industrial markets such as mining offhighway and energy these products include heat exchangers and friction materials 

• aftermarket products and services  historically aftermarket sales are less cyclical than oem sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance and service work must be performed even during an industry slowdown in 2019 net sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 55 of total net sales as a long time supplier of original equipment we have an extensive installed base of equipment in the field which generates recurring aftermarket sales wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its components and we seek to expand this business with customers who currently perform the work inhouse in this way we expect to benefit as transit authorities and railroads outsource certain maintenance and overhaul functions 

• acquisitions joint ventures and alliances  we continue to invest in acquisitions joint ventures and alliances using a disciplined selective approach and rigorous financial criteria these transactions are expected to meet our financial criteria and contribute to growth strategies of product innovation and new technologies global expansion and 

aftermarket products and services we believe these expansion strategies will help wabtec to grow profitably expand geographically and dampen the impact from potential cycles in the north american freight rail industry 

recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 5 of this report for additional information about our recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 224 billion at december 31 2019 for 2019 about 60 of total net sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages generally if a customer were to cancel a contract we would have an enforceable right to payment for work completed up to the date of cancellation which would include a reasonable profit margin substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or canceled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018 and the expected year of completion are as follows 



engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we invested about 2099 million 875 million and 952 million respectively on product development and improvement activities significant incremental engineering expense is incurred with the execution of original equipment customer contracts across the corporation we have established multiple centers of competence which have specialized technical expertise in various disciplines and product areas 

our engineering and development program includes investments in data analytics train control and other new technologies with an emphasis on developing products that enhance safety productivity and efficiency for our customers for example we have developed advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other industry suppliers 

we use our product development system to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

positive train control ptc 

ptc is a collisionavoidance system that uses gps to monitor and control the movement of passenger and freight trains in 2008 the us mandated the use of ptc on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us the federal railroad administration the fra eventually approved the use of wabtec’s electronic train management system® as the onboard locomotive standard for the deployment of this technology our system includes an onboard locomotive computer and related software the deadline to implement this technology was december 31 2018 and we worked with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to meet this deadline the railroads have until december 31 2020 to complete testing of the systems 

intellectual property 

we have 7133 active patents worldwide and on average file for approximately 350 new patents each year we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property we also follow the product development practices of our competitors to monitor any possible patent infringement by them and to evaluate their strategies and plans 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees are beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

we provide products and services for more than 500 customers worldwide our customers include passenger transit authorities and railroads throughout north america europe asia pacific south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars passenger transit vehicles and buses and companies that lease and maintain such equipment 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 our top five customers accounted for approximately 27 of net sales bnsf railway canadian national railway indian railways komatsu ltd and union pacific railroad no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated net sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally although market shares vary by product lines and geographies we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines and geographies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel a division of caterpillar and knorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america knorr is our main competitor although not in every product line or geography in addition our competitors often include smaller local suppliers in most international markets depending on the product line and geography we can also compete with our customers such as crrc corporation limited a chinabased manufacturer of rolling stock 

employees 

at december 31 2019 we employed approximately 27500 fulltime employees around the world this figure includes employees subject to collective bargaining agreements most of which are outside of north america we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations and labor relations will be so 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the us and around the world these entities typically govern equipment safety and interoperability standards for freight rail rolling stock and passenger transit oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers new products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy as a result of these regulations and requirements we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries the governing bodies include the fra and the association of american railroads aar in the us and the international union of railways “uic” and the european railway agencies in europe also in europe the european committees for standardization continually draft new european standards which cover for example the reliability availability maintainability and safety of railways systems to guarantee interoperability in europe the european union for railway agencies is responsible for defining and implementing technical standards of interoperability which covers areas such as infrastructure energy rolling stock telematic applications traffic operation and management subsystems noise pollution and waste generation protection against fire and smoke and system safety 

most countries and regions in which wabtec does business have similar rulemaking bodies in russia a gostr certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals in russian territory in china any product or system sold on the chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards in the local indian market most products are covered by regulations patterned after aar and uic standards 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal the third quarter results may be affected by the timing of services performed under our locomotive maintenance contracts and vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers and fourth quarter results may be affected by the timing of spare parts and service orders placed by transit agencies worldwide quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays 

environmental matters 

additional information on environmental matters is included in note 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally particularly in our key end markets could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result customer order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations furthermore the average service life of certain products in our end markets has increased in recent years due to innovations in technologies and manufacturing processes which has also allowed end users to replace parts less often as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a global competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do may have a more extensive lowcost sourcing strategy and presence in lowcost regions than we do or may receive significant governmental support price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers with significant negotiating power has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support if our competitors invest heavily in innovation and develop products that are more efficient or effective than our products we may not be able to compete effectively there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

• difficulties in achieving identified financial and operating synergies including the integration of operations services and products 

• diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns 

• the assumption of unknown liabilities and 

• unanticipated changes in the market conditions business and economic factors affecting such an acquisition joint venture or alliance 

we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify or consummate suitable acquisitions joint ventures or alliances we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in such strategic transactions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement this strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our existing products or to react appropriately to changes in demand we may experience delayed product shipments and customer dissatisfaction if demand increases significantly from current levels both we and our suppliers may have difficulty meeting such demand particularly if such demand increases occur rapidly alternatively we may carry excess inventory if demand for our products decreases below projected levels 

additionally we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors furthermore we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

failure to accurately predict and react to customer demand could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to respond adequately or in a timely manner to innovative changes in new technology 

in recent years the global transportation landscape has been characterized by rapid changes in technology leading to innovative transportation and logistics concepts that could change the way the railway industry does business there may be additional innovations impacting the railway industry that we cannot yet foresee any failure by us to quickly adapt to and adopt new innovations in products and processes desired by our customers may result in a significant loss of demand for our product and service offerings in addition advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control mandate from the us federal government 

in 2015 the us rail industrys ptc deadline was extended by congress by three years through december 31 2018 which also included the ability of railroads to request an additional two years for compliance with the approval of the department of transportation if certain parameters are met the department of transportation has largely granted the additional two years for compliance all freight railroads are required to have testing complete and positive train control fully implemented across the required network by december 31 2020 these extensions could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering ptc services to our customers 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects in economic downturns 

railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical and is influenced by a variety of factors new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced by a variety of factors including major replacement programs the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities and the quality and cost of alternative modes of transportation to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or canceled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 approximately 60 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the united states we intend to continue to expand our international operations including in emerging markets in the future our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france and we conduct other international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures including in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland russia spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

• lack of complete operating control 

• lack of local business experience 

• currency exchange fluctuations and devaluations 

• restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds or limitations on our ability to repatriate income or capital 

• the complexities of operating within multiple tax jurisdictions 

• foreign trade restrictions and exchange controls 

• adverse impacts of international trade policies such as import quotas capital controls or tariffs 

• difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights 

• the challenges of complying with complex and changing laws regulations and policies of foreign governments 

• the difficulties involved in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• the potential for nationalization of enterprises 

• economic political and social instability 

• possible local catastrophes such as natural disasters and epidemics and 

• possible terrorist attacks conflicts and wars including those against american interests 

our exposure to the risks associated with international operations may intensify if our international operations expand in the future 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including anticorruption laws in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to various laws rules and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions in which we do business such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act the french law n° 20161691 sapin ii and the uk bribery act relating to our business and our employees we are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations including regulations administered by the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security the us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control and various nonus government entities including applicable export control regulations economic sanctions on countries and persons customs requirements 

currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations despite our policies procedures and compliance programs our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect us from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could damage our reputation subject us to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt our business and as a result could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition our manufacturing operations are subject to safety operations maintenance and mechanical standards rules and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations both domestically and internationally our business may be adversely impacted by new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules or regulations which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of certain of our products or could make such products obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to their useful lives we are unable to predict what impact these or other regulatory changes may have if any on our business or the industry as a whole we cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with any new standards or regulations will not be material to our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water substances in products the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we have incurred and will continue to incur both operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations including costs associated with the cleanup and investigation of some of our current and former properties and offsite disposal locations we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have significant consequences on our business and results of operations including the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations injunctive relief including requirements that we limit or cease operations at affected facilities and reputational risk 

in addition certain of our products are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent statutory and regulatory requirements governing eg  emissions and noise including standards imposed by the us environmental protection agency the european union and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures relating to compliance with these standards the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of these standardsparticularly in emerging marketsare unpredictable and subject to change 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

we have followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation we have reviewed the potential challenges for us that climate change policy and legislation may pose any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time we cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on our operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

the occurrence of litigation in which we are or could be named as a defendant is unpredictable 

from time to time we are subject directly or through our subsidiaries to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business customers suppliers creditors stockholders product liability including asbestos claims intellectual property infringement competition and antitrust claims warranty claims or environmentalrelated matters 

due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all in addition although in some cases we may be indemnified by nonaffiliated entities that retain liabilities in connection with specific 

matters there can be no assurance that these indemnitors will remain financially viable and capable of satisfying their obligations 

any litigation even a claim without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we may be adversely affected 

our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely primarily on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and unfair competition laws as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights however filing prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive moreover existing us legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights as a result a significant portion of our technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology further although we routinely conduct anticounterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions we have encountered counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights counterfeit components of low quality may negatively impact our brand value accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon counterfeiting or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights then our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

in addition we operate in industries in which there are many thirdparty owners of intellectual property rights owners of intellectual property that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable third party intellectual property owners may assert infringement claims against us based on their intellectual property portfolios if we are sued for intellectual property infringement we may incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims even if we prevail 

we face cybersecurity and data protection risks relating to cyber attacks and information technology failures that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on information technology in our business we also collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information including proprietary business information personal data and other information that may be subject to privacy and security laws regulations andor customerimposed data protection controls we also provide technological products integral to train operation accordingly our business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to our own or thirdparty information technology infrastructure which could result from individual or highlycoordinated cyber attacks including but not limited to data theft system breaches malfeasance or improper use or unauthorized access to it systems our business may also be adversely impacted by unintentional technology disruptions including those resulting from programming errors employee operational errors and software defects 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor shortages and labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we depend on skilled labor in our manufacturing and other businesses due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate we may not be able to retain recruit and train the personnel we require particularly when the economy expands production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases 

we collectively bargain with labor unions at some of our operations throughout the world failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations furthermore nonunion employees in certain countries have the right to strike if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel 

any such labor shortages or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

equipment failures interruptions delays in deliveries or extensive damage to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

all of our facilities equipment supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as disease outbreak fires earthquakes explosions floods tornadoes hurricanes or weather conditions an interruption in our manufacturing capabilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems whether as a result of such catastrophic loss or any other reason could reduce prevent or delay our production and shipment of our product offerings result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses this could result in the delay or termination of orders the loss of future sales and a negative impact to our reputation with our customers 

thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to such matters will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses any of these risks coming to fruition could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be exposed to raw material shortages supply shortages and fluctuations in raw material energy and commodity prices 

we purchase energy steel aluminum copper rubber and rubberbased materials chemicals polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources and traditionally have not had longterm pricing contracts with our pure raw material suppliers the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers experience a lag in our ability to pass increases to our customers or operational efficiencies are not achieved our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our businesses compete globally for key production inputs in addition we rely upon thirdparty suppliers including certain singlesourced suppliers for various components for our products in the event of a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs we may experience challenges sourcing certain of our components to meet our production requirements and may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of certain raw materials or key inputs any such shortage may materially adversely affect our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs 

changes to international trade policies including tariffs and foreign trade restrictions could adversely affect our business 

as a global transportation company we generate export sales from our us operations and also derive international sales through our foreign subsidiaries licensees and joint ventures we also do business with industry suppliers located in various international markets a protectionist trade environment in either the united states or those foreign countries in which we do business such as a change in the current tariff structures export compliance or other trade policies may adversely affect our business in particular such policies may impact or delay our customers investments in our products reduce the competitiveness of our products in certain markets and inhibit our ability to costeffectively purchase necessary inputs from certain suppliers in addition to the extent developments in international trade relations result in reduced global trade or slower growth in global trade it is likely that this would result in reductions in investment in freight and transit rail 

international trade policies are affected by a diverse array of factors including global and national economic and political conditions which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions although we actively monitor developments in international trade and proactively engage in efforts to mitigate the effect of trade policies there can be no guarantee that these efforts will be successful 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn and report revenues and vice versa in addition a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from nonus operations and the translated value of the net assets of our nonus operations when reported in us dollars in our consolidated financial statements we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

if we lose our senior management or key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

the success of our business is largely dependent on our senior management team as well as on our ability to attract and retain other qualified key personnel it cannot be assured that we will be able to retain all of our current senior management personnel and attract and retain other key personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of 

senior management and other key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have substantial operations located in emerging markets and are subject to regulatory economic social and political uncertainties in such markets 

we have substantial operations located in emerging markets such as brazil india kazakhstan the russian federation and ukraine operations in such emerging markets are inherently risky due to a number of regulatory economic social and political uncertainties these risks include economies that may be dependent on only a few products and are therefore subject to significant fluctuations weak legal systems which may affect our ability to enforce contractual rights possible exchange controls unstable governments nationalization or privatization actions or other government actions affecting the flow of goods and currency 

significant changes in economic and regulatory policy in emerging countries as well as social or political uncertainties could significantly harm business and economic conditions in these markets generally and could disproportionately impact the rail industry which could adversely affect our business and prospects in these markets 

in addition physical and financial infrastructure may be less developed in some emerging countries than that of many developed nations any disruptions with respect to banking and financial infrastructure communication systems or any public facility including transportation infrastructure could disrupt our normal business activity such disruptions could interrupt our business operations and significantly harm our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2019 we had total debt of 44 billion including 35 billion related to senior notes and 09 billion related to term loans and amounts drawn under our revolving loan facility in each case under the senior credit facility being indebted could have important consequences to us for example our indebtedness could 

• increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industries in which we operate 

• place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt and 

• limit our ability to borrow additional funds 

the indentures for our outstanding senior notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

our credit agreement subjects us to customary i affirmative covenants including requirements with respect to certain reporting obligations on us and our subsidiaries and ii negative covenants including limitations on indebtedness liens restricted payments fundamental changes including certain changes in control business activities transactions with affiliates restrictive agreements changes in fiscal year and use of proceeds in addition we are required to maintain i a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least 300 to 100 over each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on the last day of a fiscal quarter and ii a leverage ratio calculated as of the last day of a fiscal quarter for a period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of 325 to 100 or less provided that in connection with the acquisition of ge transportation and in the event of any further material acquisition in which the cash consideration to be paid exceeds 5000 million the maximum leverage ratio permitted adjusts to x 375 to 100 at the end of the fiscal quarter in which such acquisition is consummated and each of the three fiscal quarters immediately following such fiscal quarter and y 350 to 100 at the end of each of the fourth and fifth full fiscal quarters after the consummation of such acquisition 

the indentures under which our senior notes were issued contain covenants and restrictions which limit subject to certain exceptions certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to principal properties the incurrence of secured debt without equally and ratably securing the senior notes and certain merger and consolidation transactions in addition the indentures require that we offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes upon the occurrence of certain change of control triggering events 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

although we believe that our recent acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these 

improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

• the uncertainty that an acquired business will achieve anticipated operating results 

• significant expenses to integrate 

• diversion of management’s attention from business operations to integration matters 

• departure of key personnel from the acquired business 

• effectively managing entrepreneurial spirit and decisionmaking 

• integration of different information systems 

• unanticipated costs and exposure to unforeseen liabilities and 

• impairment of assets

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend

overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of locomotives valueadded technologybased equipment systems and services for the global freight rail and passenger transit industries our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and efficiency and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in over 50 countries in 2019 net sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 55 of total net sales while 60 of the company’s net sales came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec excellence program and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including product innovation and new technologies global and market expansion aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and transit rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight and transit rail 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtecs products and services 

according to the 2018 biannual edition of a market study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services was more than 100 billion and was expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 26 through 2023 the three largest geographic markets which represented about 80 of the total accessible market were europe north america and asia pacific unife projected aboveaverage growth rates in north america latin america and africamiddle east with asia pacific and europe growing at about the industry average unife said trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support continue to drive investment the largest product segments of the market were rolling stock services and infrastructure which represent almost 90 of the accessible market unife projected spending on turnkey management projects and infrastructure to grow at aboveaverage rates unife estimated that the global installed base of diesel and electric locomotives was about 114800 units with about 33 in asia pacific about 26 in north america and about 18 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states wabtec estimates that about 2900 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2019 unife estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 51 million with about 33 in north america about 26 in asia pacific and about 24 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 174000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2019 unife estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 600000 units with about 45 in asia pacific about 33 in europe and about 12 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 35000 new passenger transit vehicles were ordered worldwide in 2019 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental policies encourage continued investment in public mass transit and modal shift from car to rail according to unife france germany and the united kingdom were the largest western european transit markets representing almost twothirds of industry spending in the european union unife projected the accessible western european rail market to grow at about 23 annually led by investments in new rolling stock in france and germany about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in recent years the european commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the european rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements unife believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 50 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems 

growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets india is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system for example the country has awarded a 1000unit locomotive order to ge transportation 

other key geographic markets include russiacis and africamiddle east with about 12 million freight cars and about 20000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives according to unife emerging markets were expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in its study unife also said it expected increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management and in rail control technologies both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry unife said datadriven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives 

in 2020 and beyond general global economic and market conditions will have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

cash pooling 

wabtec aggregates the companys domestic cash position on a daily basis outside the united states the company uses cash pooling arrangements with banks to help manage our liquidity requirements in these pooling arrangements wabtec subsidiaries “participants” agree with a single bank that the cash balances of any of the pool participants with the bank will be subject to a full right of setoff against amounts other participants owe the bank and the bank provides for overdrafts as long as the net balance for all participants does not exceed an agreedupon level typically each participant pays interest on outstanding overdrafts and receives interest on cash balances the companys consolidated balance sheets reflect cash net of bank overdrafts under all pooling arrangements

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves pensions and other postretirement benefits stock based compensation and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 18 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories 

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring writedowns to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

business combinations 

description the company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with asc 805 business combinations which requires the purchase price of the acquired business to be allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the respective fair values the amount of purchase price which is in excess of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties discounted cash flow models are used to estimate the fair values of acquired contract backlog customer relationships intellectual property intangibles and belowmarket customer contract liabilities the significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the intangible assets and offmarket customer contract liabilities included revenue growth rates projected profit margins discount rates royalty rates customer attrition rates revenue obsolescence rates and market participant profit margins these significant assumptions are forwardlooking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions different assumptions may result in materially different values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed which may impact the companys financial position and future results of operations 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations for example based on the quantitative analysis performed as of october 1 2019 a decline in the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by 794 million or an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by 2168 million even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values see note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

warranty reserves 

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for warranty expense 

stockbased compensation 

description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new threeyear performance cycle with the most recently completed cycle being 20172019 no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance 

goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock units vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts in the initial grant year of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period for example a 10 decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stockbased compensation expense by approximately 15 million 

income taxes 

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

revenue recognition 

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” the company recognizes revenues on longterm customer agreements involving the design and production of highly engineered products that require revenue to be recognized over time because these products have no alternative use without significant economic loss and the agreements contain an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin from the customer in the event of contract termination generally the company uses an input method for determining the amount of revenue cost and gross margin to recognize over time for these customer agreements the input methods used for these agreements include costs of material and labor both of which give an accurate representation of the progress made toward complete satisfaction of a particular performance obligation 

judgments and uncertainties accounting for longterm customer agreements involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages contract estimates related to longterm projects are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that could span several years these assumptions include cost of materials labor availability and productivity complexity of the work to be performed and the performance of suppliers customers and subcontracts that may be associated with the contract factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements generally pricing is defined in our contracts but may contain include an estimate of variable consideration when required by the terms of the individual customer contract types of variable consideration that the company typically has include volume discounts prompt payment discounts liquidating damages and performance bonuses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may 

adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods some of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts

 in 2017 wabtec completed the acquisition of faiveley transport sa “faiveley transport” a leading provider of valueadded integrated systems and services primarily for the global transit rail market for a purchase price of approximately 15 billion  based in france faiveley transport has roots to 1919 and became a leader in manufacturing pantographs automatic door mechanisms and air conditioning systems faiveley transport was listed on the paris stock exchange in 1994 and during the next 20 years acquired a number of rail industry leaders including sab wabco a specialist in railway braking systems and couplers wabtec believes that the acquisition of faiveley transport provided the following strategic benefits 



 today we are one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment systems and services for the global passenger transit and freight rail industries we believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on most locomotives freight cars passenger transit cars and buses around the world in 2018  the company had sales of approximately 44 billion  and net income attributable to our shareholders of about 2949 million  in 2018  sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 57  of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 67  of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the global passenger transit and freight rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of passenger transit agencies and freight railroads around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization and growth in developing markets a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness increasing investment in technology solutions an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in passenger transit and freight rail 

according to the 2018 biannual edition of a market study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services was more than 100 billion and was expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 26 through 2023 the three largest geographic markets which represented about 80 of the total accessible market were europe north america and asia pacific unife projected aboveaverage growth rates in north america latin america and africamiddle east with asia pacific and europe growing at about the industry average unife said trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support continue to drive investment the largest product segments of the market were rolling stock services and infrastructure which represent almost 90 of the accessible market unife projected spending on turnkey management projects and infrastructure to grow at aboveaverage rates unife estimated that the global installed base of locomotives was about 114000 units with about 33 in asia pacific about 26 in north america and about 18 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states wabtec estimates that about 2500 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2018 and we expect deliveries of about 2900 in 2019 unife estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 51 million with about 33 in north america about 26 in asia pacific and about 24 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 175000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2018 and we expect deliveries of about 174000 in 2019 unife estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 600000 units with about 45 in asia pacific about 33 in europe and about 12 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 30000 new passenger transit vehicles were ordered worldwide in 2018 and we expect orders of about the same number in 2019 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage continued investment in public mass transit according to unife france germany and the united kingdom were the largest western european transit markets representing almost twothirds of industry spending in the european union unife projected the accessible western european rail market to grow at about 23 annually led by investments in new rolling stock in france and germany about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in recent years the european commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the european rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements unife believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 50 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare 

box revenues demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems 

growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets india is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system for example the country has awarded a 1000unit locomotive order to ge transportation 

other key geographic markets include russiacis and africamiddle east with about 12 million freight cars and about 20000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives according to unife emerging markets were expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in its study unife also said it expected increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management and in rail control technologies both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry unife said datadriven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives

 recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 45 billion  at december 31 2018  for 2018  about 57  of total sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages generally if a customer were to cancel a contract we would have an enforceable right to payment for work completed up to the date of cancellation which would include a reasonable profit margin substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or canceled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  and the expected year of completion are as follows 



engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we invested about 875 million  952 million  and 714 million  respectively on product development and improvement activities the engineering resources of the company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts across the corporation we have established multiple centers of competence which have specialized technical expertise in various disciplines and product areas 

           our engineering and development program includes investments in data analytics train control and other new technologies with an emphasis on developing products that enhance safety productivity and efficiency for our customers for example we have developed advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other industry suppliers 

we use our product development system to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

positive train control ptc 

           ptc is a collisionavoidance system that uses gps to monitor and control the movement of passenger and freight trains in 2008 the us mandated the use of ptc on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us the federal railroad administration the fra eventually approved the use of wabtec’s electronic train management system® as the onboard locomotive standard for the deployment of this technology our system includes an onboard locomotive computer and related software the deadline to implement this technology was december 31 2018 and we worked with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to meet this deadline under certain conditions the deadline could be extended through 2019 and 2020 in 2018 wabtec recorded about 395 million  of revenue from freight and transit train control and signaling projects which includes ptc 

intellectual property 

we have 3333  active patents worldwide and on average file for approximately 150  new patents each year we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property we also follow the product development practices of our competitors to monitor any possible patent infringement by them and to evaluate their strategies and plans 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees are beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

we provide products and services for more than 500 customers worldwide our customers include passenger transit authorities and railroads throughout north america europe asia pacific south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars passenger transit vehicles and buses and companies that lease and maintain such equipment 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018  our top five customers accounted for approximately 15  of net sales bombardier inc alstom the greenbrier companies indian railways and trinity industries no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally although market shares vary by product lines and geographies we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines and geographies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel a division of caterpillar and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america knorr is our main competitor although not in every product line or geography in addition our competitors often include smaller local suppliers in most international markets depending on the product line and geography we can also compete with our customers such as crrc corporation limited a chinabased manufacturer of rolling stock 

employees 

at december 31 2018  we employed approximately 18000  fulltime employees around the world this figure includes employees subject to collective bargaining agreements most of which are outside of north america we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations and labor relations will be so 

regulation 

           in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the us and around the world these entities typically govern equipment safety and interoperability standards for passenger transit and freight rail rolling stock oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers new products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy as a result of these regulations and requirements we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries the governing bodies include the fra and the association of american railroads aar in the us and the international union of railways “uic” and the european railway agencies in europe also in europe the european committees for standardization continually draft new european standards which cover for example the reliability availability maintainability and safety of railways systems to guarantee interoperability in europe the european union for railway agencies is responsible for defining and implementing technical standards of interoperability which covers areas such as infrastructure energy rolling stock telematic applications traffic operation and management subsystems noise pollution and waste generation protection against fire and smoke and system safety 

most countries and regions in which wabtec does business have similar rulemaking bodies in russia a gostr certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals in russian territory in china any product or system sold on the chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards in the local indian market most products are covered by regulations patterned after aar and uic standards 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal the third quarter results may be affected by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers and fourth quarter results may be affected by the timing of spare parts and service orders placed by transit agencies worldwide quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays 

environmental matters

risk factors 

tableend

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally particularly in our key end markets could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result customer order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations furthermore the average service life of certain products in our end markets has increased in recent years due to innovations in technologies and manufacturing processes which has also allowed end users to replace parts less often as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a global competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do may have a more extensive lowcost sourcing strategy and presence in lowcost regions than we do or may receive significant governmental support price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers with significant negotiating power has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support if our competitors invest heavily in innovation and develop products that are more efficient or effective than our products we may not be able to compete effectively there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify or consummate suitable acquisitions joint ventures or alliances we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in such strategic transactions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement this strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business 

if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our existing products or to react appropriately to changes in demand we may experience delayed product shipments and customer dissatisfaction if demand increases significantly from current levels both we and our suppliers may have difficulty meeting such demand particularly if such demand increases occur rapidly alternatively we may carry excess inventory if demand for our products decreases below projected levels 

additionally we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer 

acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors furthermore we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

failure to accurately predict and react to customer demand could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may fail to respond adequately or in a timely manner to innovative changes in new technology 

in recent years the global transportation landscape has been characterized by rapid changes in technology leading to innovative transportation and logistics concepts that could change the way the railway industry does business there may be additional innovations impacting the railway industry that we cannot yet foresee any failure by us to quickly adapt to and adopt new innovations in products and processes desired by our customers may result in a significant loss of demand for our product and service offerings in addition advances in technology may require us to increase investments in order to remain competitive and our customers may not be willing to accept higher prices to cover the cost of these investments 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ptc mandate from the us federal government which requires the use of onboard locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018  we had sales of about 395 million  related to train control and signaling which includes ptc in 2015 the industrys ptc deadline was extended by three years through december 31 2018 which also included the ability of railroads to request an additional two years for compliance with the approval of the department of transportation if certain parameters are met this could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering ptc services 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical and is influenced by a variety of factors new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced by a variety of factors including major replacement programs the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities and the quality and cost of alternative modes of transportation to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018  approximately 67  of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the united states we intend to continue to expand our international operations including in emerging markets in the future our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france and we conduct other international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures including in australia austria brazil canada 

china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland russia spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 our exposure to the risks associated with international operations may intensify if our international operations expand in the future 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against us and certain of our affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that we acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that have retained the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with most other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations including anticorruption laws in various jurisdictions 

we are subject to various laws rules and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions in which we do business such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act the french law n° 20161691 sapin ii and the uk bribery act relating to our business and our employees we are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations including regulations administered by the us department of commerce’s bureau of industry and security the us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control and various nonus government entities including applicable export control regulations economic sanctions on countries and persons customs requirements currency exchange regulations and transfer pricing regulations despite our policies procedures and compliance programs our internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect us from prohibited acts willfully committed by our employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could damage our reputation subject us to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt our business and as a result could materially adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition our manufacturing operations are subject to safety operations maintenance and mechanical standards rules and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations both domestically and internationally our business may be adversely impacted by new rules and regulations or changes to existing rules or regulations which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of certain of our products or could make such products obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to their useful lives we are unable to predict what impact these or other regulatory changes may have if any on our business or the industry as a whole we cannot assure that costs incurred to comply with any new standards or regulations will not be material to our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water substances in products the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we have incurred and will continue to incur both operating and capital costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations including costs associated with the cleanup and 

investigation of some of our current and former properties and offsite disposal locations we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have significant consequences on our business and results of operations including the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations injunctive relief including requirements that we limit or cease operations at affected facilities and reputational risk 

in addition certain of our products are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent statutory and regulatory requirements governing eg  emissions and noise including standards imposed by the us environmental protection agency the european union and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures relating to compliance with these standards the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of these standardsparticularly in emerging marketsare unpredictable and subject to change 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

we have followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation we have reviewed the potential challenges for us that climate change policy and legislation may pose any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time we cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on our operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

the occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable 

from time to time we are subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business customers suppliers creditors stockholders product liability intellectual property infringement warranty claims or environmentalrelated matters due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims any litigation even a claim without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all 

if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we may be adversely affected 

our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely primarily on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and unfair competition laws as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights however filing prosecuting and defending patents on our products in all countries and jurisdictions throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive moreover existing us legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights as a result a significant portion of our technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology further although we routinely conduct anticounterfeiting activities in multiple jurisdictions we have encountered counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights counterfeit components of low quality may negatively impact our brand value accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon counterfeiting or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights then our business results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted 

in addition we operate in industries in which there are many thirdparty owners of intellectual property rights owners of intellectual property that we need to conduct our business as it evolves may be unwilling to license such intellectual property rights to us on terms we consider reasonable third party intellectual property owners may assert infringement claims against us based on their intellectual property portfolios if we are sued for intellectual property infringement we may incur significant expenses investigating and defending such claims even if we prevail 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business in addition we collect process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information in the normal course of business cybersecurity attacks could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include employee education password encryption frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace and frequent backups however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyberattack a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees customers and suppliers and potentially violate certain domestic and international privacy laws furthermore a cybersecurity attack on our customers and suppliers could compromise our confidential information in the possession of our customers and suppliers a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations including through lawsuits by thirdparties in addition the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is constantly changing and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor shortages and labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we depend on skilled labor in our manufacturing and other businesses due to the competitive nature of the labor markets in which we operate we may not be able to retain recruit and train the personnel we require particularly when the economy expands production rates are high or competition for such skilled labor increases 

we collectively bargain with labor unions at some of our operations throughout the world failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations furthermore nonunion employees in certain countries have the right to strike if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel 

any such labor shortages or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

equipment failures interruptions delays in deliveries or extensive damage to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems could adversely affect our business 

all of our facilities equipment supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires earthquakes explosions floods tornados hurricanes or weather conditions an interruption in our manufacturing capabilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems whether as a result of such catastrophic loss or any other reason could reduce prevent or delay our production and shipment of our product offerings result in defective products or services damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expenses this could result in the delay or termination of orders the loss of future sales and a negative impact to our reputation with our customers 

thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain with respect to such matters will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to 

protect us against losses any of these risks coming to fruition could materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be exposed to raw material shortages supply shortages and fluctuations in raw material energy and commodity prices 

we purchase energy steel aluminum copper rubber and rubberbased materials chemicals polymers and other key manufacturing inputs from outside sources and traditionally have not had longterm pricing contracts with our pure raw material suppliers the costs of these raw materials have been volatile historically and are influenced by factors that are outside our control if we are unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials on to our customers experience a lag in our ability to pass increases to our customers or operational efficiencies are not achieved our operating margins and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

our businesses compete globally for key production inputs in addition we rely upon thirdparty suppliers including certain singlesourced suppliers for various components for our products in the event of a shortage or discontinuation of certain raw materials or key inputs we may experience challenges sourcing certain of our components to meet our production requirements and may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of certain raw materials or key inputs any such shortage may materially adversely affect our competitive position versus companies that are able to better or more cheaply source such raw materials or key inputs 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs may be denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn and report revenues and vice versa in addition a decrease in the value of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar could reduce our profits from nonus operations and the translated value of the net assets of our nonus operations when reported in us dollars in our consolidated financial statements we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

if we lose our senior management or key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

the success of our business is largely dependent on our senior management team as well as on our ability to attract and retain other qualified key personnel it cannot be assured that we will be able to retain all of our current senior management personnel and attract and retain other key personnel necessary for the development of our business the loss of the services of senior management and other key personnel or the failure to attract additional personnel as required could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

following the consummation of the acquisition of ge transportation we will have substantial operations located in india and will be subject to regulatory economic social and political uncertainties in india 

although we currently have operations in india following the consummation of our acquisition of ge transportation these operations will be substantially more significant including a largescale project involving the construction of a factory in the state of bihar which includes a township to house employees the project also includes construction of two service sheds in the states of uttar pradesh and gujarat operations in india are inherently risky due to a number of regulatory economic social and political uncertainties for example in september 2017 several media outlets reported that the indian government expressed a desire to switch the countrys rail system from diesel to electric locomotives which would threaten to interfere with the completion of the project and curtail the viability of our ongoing operations in india while no such actions have been taken to date any change in policy with respect to india’s rail system could have a material adverse effect on the business of the combined company 

in addition the indian government has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy since 1991 successive indian governments have generally pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms including by significantly relaxing restrictions on the private sector nevertheless the role of the indian central and state governments in the indian economy as producers consumers and regulators has remained significant and we cannot assure you that such liberalization policies will continue the rate of economic liberalization could change and specific laws and policies affecting foreign investments in india could change as well including exposure to possible expropriation nationalization or other governmental actions 

further protests against privatizations and government corruption scandals which have occurred in the past could slow the pace of liberalization and deregulation a significant change in india’s policy of economic liberalization and deregulation or 

any social or political uncertainties could significantly harm business and economic conditions in india generally and our business and prospects 

india’s physical infrastructure is less developed than that of many developed nations any congestion or disruption with respect to communication systems or any public facility including transportation infrastructure could disrupt our normal business activity any deterioration of india’s physical infrastructure would harm the national economy disrupt the transportation of people goods and supplies and add costs to doing business in india these disruptions could interrupt our business operations and significantly harm our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 30  countries in 2018  about 67  of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec excellence program and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including product innovation and new technologies global and market expansion aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and transit rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight and transit rail 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtecs products and services 

according to the 2018 biannual edition of a market study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services was more than 100 billion and was expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 26 through 2023 the three largest geographic markets which represented about 80 of the total accessible market were europe north america and asia pacific unife projected aboveaverage growth rates in north america latin america and africamiddle east with asia pacific and europe growing at about the industry average unife said trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support continue to drive investment the largest product segments of the market were rolling stock services and infrastructure which represent almost 90 of the accessible market unife projected spending on turnkey management projects and infrastructure to grow at aboveaverage rates unife estimated that the global installed base of locomotives was about 114000 units with about 33 in asia pacific about 26 in north america and about 18 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states wabtec estimates that about 2500 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2018 and we expect deliveries of about 2900 in 2019 unife estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 51 million with about 33 in north america about 26 in asia pacific and about 24 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 175000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2018 and we expect deliveries of about 174000 in 2019 unife estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 600000 units with about 45 in asia pacific about 33 in europe and about 12 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 30000 new passenger transit vehicles were ordered worldwide in 2018 and we expect orders of about the same number in 2019 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage continued investment in public mass transit according to unife france germany and the united kingdom were the largest western european transit markets representing almost twothirds of industry spending in the european union unife projected the accessible western european rail market to grow at about 23 annually led by investments in new rolling stock in france and germany about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in recent years the european commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the european rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements unife believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 50 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems 

growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets india is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system for example the country has awarded a 1000unit locomotive order to ge transportation 

other key geographic markets include russiacis and africamiddle east with about 12 million freight cars and about 20000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives according to unife emerging markets were expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in its study unife also said it expected increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management and in rail control technologies both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry unife said datadriven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives 

 in 2019  and beyond general global economic and market conditions will have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

freight segment cost of sales increased 25 as a percentage of sales to 683 in 2017 compared to 658 for the same period of 2016 the increase is primarily related to lower demand for freight original equipment rail products and train control and signaling products and services which typically offer a higher margin higher project adjustments of 69 million on certain existing contracts related to labor material and warranty costs and 45 million of restructuring and integration costs related to recent acquisitions 

transit segment cost of sales increased 34 as a percentage of sales to 748 in 2017 compared to 714 for the same period in 2016 the increase is primarily related to product mix largely attributable to the acquisition of faiveley transport which has lower overall margins and higher project adjustments of 376 million on certain existing contracts primarily related to material and warranty costs and 73 million of restructuring and integration costs related to recent acquisitions 

included in cost of sales is warranty expense the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters warranty expense was 504 million in 2017 compared to 289 million in 2016 the increase in warranty expense is primarily related to the increase in sales and the contract adjustments noted above 

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves pensions and other postretirement benefits stock based compensation and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 19 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories 

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring writedowns to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations for example based on the quantitative analysis performed as of october 1 2018 a decline in the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by 398 million or an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by 1156 million even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values necessitating no step 2 calculations see note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

warranty reserves 

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses 

accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits 

description the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for example a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense 11 million  or decrease expense 19 million  respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation 438 million  or decrease the obligation 548 million  respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense 28 million  if the actual asset values at december 31 2018  had been 1 lower the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease 02 million  

stockbased compensation 

description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new three 

year performance cycle with the most recently completed cycle being 20162018 no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock units vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts in the initial grant year of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period for example a 10 decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stockbased compensation expense by approximately 15 million  and 15 million  respectively 

income taxes 

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

revenue recognition 

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc 606 “revenue from contracts with customers” the company recognizes revenues on longterm customer agreements involving the design and production of highly engineered products that require revenue to be recognized over time because these products have no alternative use with significant economic loss and the agreements contain an enforceable right to payment including a reasonable profit margin from the customer in the event of contract termination generally the company uses an input method for determining the amount of revenue cost and gross margin to recognize over time for these customer agreements the input methods used for these agreements include costs of material and labor both of which give an accurate representation of the progress made toward complete satisfaction of a particular performance obligation 

judgments and uncertainties accounting for longterm customer agreements involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages contract estimates related to longterm projects are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events that could span several years these assumptions include cost of materials labor availability and productivity complexity of the work to be performed and the performance of suppliers customers and subcontracts that may be associated with the contract factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements generally pricing is defined in our contracts but may contain include an estimate of variable consideration when required by the terms of the individual customer contract types of variable consideration that the company typically has include volume discounts prompt payment discounts liquidating damages and performance bonuses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of 

expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2018  had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1 it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately 300 million a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts

interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variablerate debt the company’s variable rate debt represents 22 and 38 of total longterm debt at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively

general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries george westinghouse founded the original westinghouse air brake co in 1869 when he invented the air brake westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” the company went public on the new york stock exchange in 1995 in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc and adopted the name wabtec 

in 2017 wabtec completed the acquisition of faiveley transport sa “faiveley transport” a leading provider of valueadded integrated systems and services primarily for the global transit rail market for a purchase price of approximately 15 billion  based in france faiveley transport has roots to 1919 and became a leader in manufacturing pantographs automatic door mechanisms and air conditioning systems faiveley transport was listed on the paris stock exchange in 1994 and during the next 20 years acquired a number of rail industry leaders including sab wabco a specialist in railway braking systems and couplers wabtec believes that the acquisition of faiveley transport provides the following strategic benefits 

 today we are one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment systems and services for the global passenger transit and freight rail industries we believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on most locomotives freight cars passenger transit cars and buses around the world in 2017  the company had sales of approximately 39 billion  and net income attributable to our shareholders of about 2623 million  in 2017  sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 56  of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 66  of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the global passenger transit and freight rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of passenger transit agencies and freight railroads around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization and growth in developing markets a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness increasing investment in technology solutions an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in passenger transit and freight rail 

according to the 2016 biannual edition of a market study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services was more than 100 billion and was expected to grow at about 32 annually through 2021 the three largest geographic markets which represented about 80 of the total accessible market were europe north america and asia pacific unife projected aboveaverage growth in asia pacific and europe due to overall economic growth and trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support the largest product segments of the market were rolling stock services and infrastructure which represent almost 90 of the accessible market unife projected spending on rolling stock to grow at an aboveaverage rate due to increased investment in passenger transit vehicles unife estimated that the global installed base of locomotives was about 114000 units with about 32 in asia pacific about 25 in north america and about 18 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states wabtec estimates that about 2600 new 

locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2017 and we expect deliveries of about 2700 in 2018 unife estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 55 million units with about 37 in north america about 26 in russiacis and about 20 in asia pacific wabtec estimates that about 155000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2017 and it expects deliveries of about 148000 in 2018 unife estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 569000 units with about 43 in asia pacific about 32 in europe and about 14 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 34000 new passenger transit vehicles were delivered worldwide in 2017 and we expect deliveries of about 44000 in 2018 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage continued investment in public mass transit according to unife france germany and the united kingdom were the largest western european transit markets representing almost twothirds of industry spending in the european union unife projected the western european rail market to grow at about 36 annually led by investments in new rolling stock in france and germany significant investments were also expected in turkey the largest market in eastern europe about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in recent years the european commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the european rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements unife believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 50 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems 

growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets india is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system for example the country has awarded a 1000unit locomotive order to a us manufacturer unife expected the increased spending in india to offset decreased spending on veryhighspeed rolling stock in china 

other key geographic markets include russiacis and africamiddle east with about 14 million freight cars and about 20000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives according to unife emerging markets were expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in its study unife also said it expected increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management and in rail control technologies both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry unife said datadriven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the transit segment and the freight segment both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers the acquisition of faiveley transport significantly strengthened our capabilities and presence in the worldwide transit market 

the transit segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically regional trains high speed trains subway cars lightrail vehicles and buses supplies rail control and infrastructure 

products including electronics positive train control equipment and signal design and engineering services builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes passenger transit vehicles customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of passenger transit vehicles and buses around the world demand in the transit market is primarily driven by general economic conditions passenger ridership levels government spending on public transportation and investment in new rolling stock in 2017  the transit segment accounted for 64  of our total sales with about 21  of its sales in the us about twothirds of the transit segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market the addition of faiveley transport’s key products strengthened wabtecs presence in the following areas highspeed braking and door systems heating ventilation and air conditioning systems pantographs and power collection information systems platform screen doors and gates couplers and aftermarket services maintenance and spare parts geographically faiveley transport significantly strengthened wabtec’s presence in the european and asia pacific transit markets 

the freight segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotives and freight cars supplies rail control and infrastructure products including electronics positive train control equipment and signal design and engineering services overhauls locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars and utilities demand is primarily driven by general economic conditions and industrial activity traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings investment in new technologies and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2017  the freight segment accounted for 36  of our total sales with about 58  of its sales in the us in 2017  slightly more than half of the freight segment’s sales were in the aftermarket 

following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments 

specialty products  electronics 

 brake products 

 remanufacturing overhaul and build 

 transit products 



we have become a leader in the passenger transit and freight rail industries by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovations and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments supported by our technical staff of over 2300  engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers 

in recent years we have introduced a number of significant new products including positive train control “ptc” equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols we are making additional investments in this technology which we believe will provide customers with opportunities to improve safety and efficiency in part through data analytics solutions other new products include hvac inverter integrated solutions brake discs and brake controls platform doors and gates and door controllers

 recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 46 billion  at december 31 2017  for 2017  about 56  of total sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages generally if a customer were to cancel a contract we would have an enforceable right to payment for work completed up to the date of cancellation which would include a reasonable profit margin substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or canceled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  and the expected year of completion are as follows 



engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we invested about 952 million  714 million  and 712 million  respectively on product development and improvement activities the engineering resources of the company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts across the corporation we have established multiple centers of competence which have specialized technical expertise in various disciplines and product areas 

           our engineering and development program includes investments in data analytics train control and other new technologies with an emphasis on developing products that enhance safety productivity and efficiency for our customers for example we have developed advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other industry suppliers 

we use our product development system to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

positive train control ptc 

           ptc is a collisionavoidance system that uses gps to monitor and control the movement of passenger and freight trains in 2008 the us mandated the use of ptc on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us the federal railroad administration fra eventually approved the use of wabtec’s electronic train management system ® as the onboard locomotive standard for the deployment of this technology our system includes an onboard locomotive computer and related software the deadline to implement this technology is december 31 2018 and we are working with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to meet this deadline under certain conditions the deadline could be extended through 2019 and 2020 in 2017 wabtec recorded about 322 million  of revenue from freight and transit train control and signaling projects which includes ptc 

intellectual property 

we have 3135  active patents worldwide and on average file for approximately 150  new patents each year we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property we also follow the product development practices of our competitors to monitor any possible patent infringement by them and to evaluate their strategies and plans 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees are beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

we provide products and services for more than 500 customers worldwide our customers include passenger transit authorities and railroads throughout north america europe asia pacific south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars passenger transit vehicles and buses and companies that lease and maintain such equipment 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017  our top five customers accounted for approximately 18  of net sales bombardier inc alstom the greenbrier companies siemens and union pacific corporation no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally although market shares vary by product lines and geographies we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines and geographies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel a division of caterpillar ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america knorr is our main competitor although not in every product line or geography in addition our competitors often include smaller local suppliers in most international markets depending on the product line and geography we can also compete with our customers such as crrc corporation limited a chinabased manufacturer of rolling stock 

employees 

at december 31 2017  we employed approximately 18000  fulltime employees around the world this figure includes employees subject to collective bargaining agreements most of which are outside of north america we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations and labor relations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

           in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the us and around the world these entities typically govern equipment safety and interoperability standards for passenger transit and freight rail rolling stock oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers new products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy as a result of these regulations and requirements we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries the governing bodies include the fra and the association of american railroads aar in the us and the international union of railways “uic” and the european railway agencies in europe also in europe the european committees for standardization continually draft new european standards which cover for example the reliability availability maintainability and safety of railways systems to guarantee interoperability in europe the european union for railway agencies is responsible for defining and implementing technical standards of interoperability which covers areas such as infrastructure energy rolling stock telematic applications traffic operation and management subsystems noise pollution and waste generation protection against fire and smoke and system safety 

most countries and regions in which wabtec does business have similar rulemaking bodies in russia a gostr certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals on russian territory in china any product or system sold on the chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards in the local indian market most products are covered by regulations patterned after aar and uic standards 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal the third quarter results may be affected by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers and fourth quarter results may be affected by the timing of spare parts and service orders placed by transit agencies worldwide quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays 

environmental matters 

additional information on environmental matters is included in note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

risk factors 

tableend

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017  our top five customers accounted for approximately 18  of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a global competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ptc mandate from the us federal government which requires the use of onboard locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018 

for the year ended december 31 2017  we had sales of about 322 million  related to train control and signaling which includes ptc in 2015 the industrys ptc deadline was extended by three years through december 31 2018 which also included the ability of railroads to request an additional two years for compliance with the approval of the department of transportation if certain parameters are met this could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2017  approximately 66  of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france and we currently conduct other international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland russia spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with most other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

the occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable 

from time to time the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business customers suppliers creditors shareholders product liability intellectual property infringement warranty claims or environmentalrelated matters due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims any litigation even a claim without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all 

the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act the french law n° 20161691 sapin ii and the uk bribery act relating to its business and its employees despite the companys policies procedures and compliance programs its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could damage the companys reputation subject it to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt the companys business and as a result could materially adversely impact the companys business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we may be adversely affected 

our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely primarily on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and unfair competition laws as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights however a significant portion of our technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology moreover 

existing us legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights then our business results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include employee education password encryption frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace and frequent backups however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyberattack a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees customers and supplier and potentially violate certain domestic and international privacy laws furthermore a cybersecurity attack on our customers and suppliers could compromise our confidential information in the possession of our customers and suppliers a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations including through lawsuits by thirdparties 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions at some of our operations throughout the world failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations furthermore nonunion employees in certain countries have the right to strike if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

being indebted could have important consequences to us at december 31 2017  we had total debt of 18705 million  if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under our 2016 refinancing credit agreement the 8531 million  currently borrowed under this facility and the 7477 million  3450 senior notes and the 2486 million  4375 senior notes for example it could 



the indenture for our 750 million  3450 senior notes due in 2026 our 250 million  4375 senior notes due in 2023 and our 2016 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the 2016 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2016 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and see note 8 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this report 

the indentures under which the senior notes were issued contain covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2016 and 2017 we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of 1865 million  which included our acquisition of faiveley transport for 1507 million  although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 31  countries in 2017  about 66  of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec excellence program and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including product innovation and new technologies global and market expansion aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and transit rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight and transit rail 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtecs products and services 

according to the 2016 edition of a market study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services was more than 100 billion and was expected to grow at about 32 annually through 2021 the three largest geographic markets which represented about 80 of the total accessible market were europe north america and asia pacific unife projected aboveaverage growth in asia pacific and europe due to overall economic growth and trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support the largest product segments of the market were rolling stock services and infrastructure which represented almost 90 of the accessible market unife projected spending on rolling stock to grow at an aboveaverage rate due to increased investment in passenger transit vehicles unife estimated that the global installed base of locomotives was about 114000 units with about 32 in asia pacific about 25 in north america and about 18 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states wabtec estimates that about 2600 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2017 and it expects deliveries of about 2700 in 2018 unife estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 55 million units with about 37 in north america about 26 in russiacis and about 20 in asia pacific wabtec estimates that about 155000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2017 and it expects deliveries of about 148000 in 2018 unife estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 569000 units with about 43 in asia pacific about 32 in europe and about 14 in russiacis wabtec estimates that about 34000 new passenger transit vehicles were delivered worldwide in 2017 and it expects deliveries of about 44000 in 2018 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage continued investment in public mass transit according to unife france germany and the united kingdom were the largest western european transit markets representing almost twothirds of industry spending in the european union unife projected the western european rail market to grow at about 36 annually led by investments in new rolling stock in france and germany significant investments were also expected in turkey the largest market in eastern europe about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in recent years the european commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the european rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements unife believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 50 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems 

growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets india is making significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system for example the country has awarded a 1000unit locomotive order to a us manufacturer unife expected the increased spending in india to offset decreased spending on veryhighspeed rolling stock in china 

other key geographic markets include russiacis and africamiddle east with about 14 million freight cars and about 20000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives according to unife emerging markets were expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade led to increased freight volumes and urbanization led to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in its study unife also said it expected increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management and in rail control technologies both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry unife said datadriven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives 

           in 2018  and beyond general global economic and market conditions will have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

net sales increased by 9506 million  to 38818 million  in 2017  from 29312 million  in 2016  the increase is due to sales from acquisitions of 11832 million  with the majority related to the faiveley transport acquisition this increase was partially offset by a 1560 million  decrease for specialty products and electronics due to lower demand for freight original equipment rail products and train control and signaling products and services a 686 million  decrease for remanufacturing overhaul and build primarily due to the absence of a large locomotive rebuild contract that completed in 2016 and a 491 million  decrease for brake products due to lower demand for original equipment brakes from freight and transit customers unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales 53 million  

freight segment sales decreased by 1465 million  or 95  primarily due to a 1645 million  decrease for specialty products and electronics sales from lower demand for freight original equipment rail products and train control and signaling products attributable to lower freight car and locomotive builds a decrease of 791 million  for remanufacturing overhaul and build sales due to a large locomotive rebuild contract that was completed in 2016 and a 516 million  decrease in brake products sales from lower demand for original equipment brakes and aftermarket services acquisitions increased sales by 1481 million  and favorable foreign exchange increased sales by 11 million  

transit segment sales increased by 10971 million  or 790  primarily due to an increase in sales from acquisitions of 10351 million  with the majority related to the faiveley transport acquisition additionally transit products sales increased 455 million  from increased demand in original train doors air conditioning systems and other transit electronics overhaul  build sales increased 105 million  due to an increase in transit overhaul demand and specialty products  electronics sales increased 85 million  due to increased demand for transit train control and signaling products and services unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by 64 million

cost of sales increased by 8095 million  to 28164 million  in 2017  compared to 20069 million  in the same period of 2016  for the twelve months ended 2017  cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 725  compared to 684  in the same period of 2016  the increase as a percentage of sales is due to product mix largely attributable to higher transit segment sales due to acquisitions along with an unfavorable product mix within the freight segment also contributing to the increase were higher project adjustments of 445 million recorded on certain existing contracts and 118 million of restructuring and integration costs related to recent acquisitions 

freight segment cost of sales increased 25  as a percentage of sales to 683  in 2017 compared to 658  for the same period of 2016 the increase is primarily related to lower demand for freight original equipment rail products and train control and signaling products and services which typically offer a higher margin higher project adjustments of 69 million on certain existing contracts related to labor material and warranty costs and 45 million of restructuring and integration costs related to recent acquisitions 

transit segment cost of sales increased 34  as a percentage of sales to 748  in 2017 compared to 714  for the same period in 2016 the increase is primarily related to product mix largely attributable to the acquisition of faiveley transport which has lower overall margins and higher project adjustments of 376 million on certain existing contracts primarily related to material and warranty costs and 73 million of restructuring and integration costs related to recent acquisitions 

included in cost of sales is warranty expense the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters warranty expense was 504 million  in 2017 compared to 289 million  in 2016  the increase in warranty expense is primarily related to the increase in sales and the contract adjustments noted above 

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses 



total operating expenses were 166  and 159  of sales for 2017 and 2016 respectively selling general and administrative expenses increased 1401 million  or 377  primarily due to 1747 million in incremental expense from   acquisitions partially offset by lower costs due to cost saving initiatives and lower organic sales volumes engineering expense increased 238 million  or 333  primarily due to additional expenses from acquisitions and remained a relatively consistent as a percentage of sales amortization expense increased 138 million  due to amortization of intangibles associated with new acquisitions 

the following table shows our segment operating expenses 



freight segment operating expenses decreased 53 million  or 29  in 2017  and increased 150 basis points to 127  of sales the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced sales volumes and realized benefits associated with the cost saving initiatives undertaken in 2017 partially offset by 197 million of incremental operating expenses from acquisitions and 32 million related to integration and restructuring costs 

transit segment operating expenses increased 2091 million  or 927  in 2017  and increased 290 basis points to 175  of sales the increase is primarily related to 191 million of incremental operating expenses related to acquisitions and 20 million related to integration and restructuring costs related to recent acquisitions

interest expense net overall interest expense net increased 261 million  in 2017  due to a higher overall debt balance in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily related to the faiveley transport acquisition and higher interest rates 

other expense net other expense net decreased 20 million  to 10 million  for 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to an increase in equity income earned on unconsolidated subsidiaries 

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 255  and 241  in 2017  and 2016  respectively on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the us tax reform bill on december 23 2017 the french government enacted the finance act for 2018 and it was published in the official bulletin on december 31 2017 as a result tax expense increased by 550 million related to the us tax reform bill see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 8 of this report for further explanation this was offset by decreases of 507 million primarily due to the revaluation of the net us and french deferred tax liabilities as a result of the tax law enactments and the result of a lower earnings mix in higher tax rate jurisdictions the net favorable deferred tax benefits related to the adjustment of deferred tax liabilities which had originally been established in prior periods 

2016  compared to 2015

net sales decreased by 3768 million to 29312 million in 2016 from 33080 million in 2015 the decrease is primarily due to lower sales for specialty products and electronics of 4027 million and lower brake products sales of 551 million due to decreased demand for freight products attributable to lower freight car and locomotive builds and train control and signaling products and services and lower other products sales of 269 million from decreased demand for freight spare part kits acquisitions increased sales 1892 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales 711 million 

freight segment sales decreased by 5116 million or 249 primarily due to a 4383 million decrease for specialty products and electronics sales from lower demand for freight original equipment rail products and train control and signaling products attributable to lower freight car and locomotive builds a decrease of 507 million for brake products sales from lower demand for original equipment brakes and aftermarket services a decrease of 337 million for remanufacturing overhaul and build sales due to a large locomotive rebuild contract that completed in 2016 and a decrease of 269 million for other product sales from decreased demand for freight spare part kits acquisitions increased sales by 551 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by 172 million 

transit segment sales increased by 1348 million or 108 primarily due to a 356 million increase for specialty products and electronics from higher demand for original equipment conduction systems and current collectors and an increase of 227 million for remanufacturing overhaul and build sales from higher demand for aftermarket locomotive builds acquisitions increased sales by 1341 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by 539 million 

cost of sales and gross profit the following table shows the major components of cost of sales for the periods indicated 

cost of sales decreased by 2532 million to 20069 million in 2016 compared to 22602 million in the same period of 2015 for the twelve months ended 2016 cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 684 compared to 683 in the same period of 2015 

freight segment cost of sales decreased 05 as a percentage of sales to 658 in 2016 compared to 663 for the same period of 2015 the decrease as a percentage of sales is primarily related to sales with lower material content lower overall material costs due to ongoing sourcing efforts and decreases in various commodity prices partially offset by an increase in overhead costs as a percentage of sales which is primarily due to certain fixed overhead costs 

transit segment cost of sales decreased 03 as a percentage of sales to 714 in 2016 compared to 717 for the same period in 2015 the decrease is primarily due to better margin performance from prior year acquisitions and ongoing sourcing savings these benefits were partially offset by 138 million of costs related to adjustments on certain longterm contracts 

included in cost of sales is warranty expense the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters warranty expense was 289 million in 2016 compared to 354 million in 2015 

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses 



total operating expenses were 159 and 134 of sales for 2016 and 2015 respectively selling general and administrative expenses increased 244 million or 70 primarily due to 389 million of costs related to the faiveley acquisition and 54 million in costs related to restructuring activity these costs were partially offset by lower incentive and noncash compensation expense and the effects of foreign exchange engineering expense was consistent with the prior year amortization expense increased 10 million due to amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 

  

the following table shows our segment operating expenses 



freight segment operating expenses decreased 261 million or 125 in 2016 and increased 160 basis points to 118 of sales the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced sales volumes and realized benefits associated with the cost saving initiatives undertaken in 2016 partially offset by 88 million of incremental operating expenses from acquisitions 

transit segment operating expenses increased 202 million or 98 in 2016 and decreased 10 basis points to 163 of sales the increase is primarily related to 262 million of incremental operating expenses related to acquisitions and 71 million related to the faiveley transport transaction this increase is partially offset by lower operating expenses due to foreign exchange 

corporate nonallocated operating expenses increased 315 million in 2016 primarily due to 318 million of costs related to the faiveley acquisition partially offset by realized benefits from cost saving initiatives in 2016 

interest expense net overall interest expense net increased 257 million in 2016 due to a higher overall debt balance in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily related to the faiveley transport acquisition and 149 million of debt refinancing costs refer to note 8 of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional information on debt 

other expense net other expense net decreased 23 million to 30 million for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to foreign exchange adjustments 

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 241 and 319 in 2016 and 2015 respectively the decrease in the effective rate is primarily the result of an enacted tax rate change which reduces the corporate income tax rate in france and a higher earnings mix in lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by 2016 transaction charges related to the acquisition of faiveley transport that are not deductible

2016 refinancing credit agreement 

on june 22 2016  the company amended its existing revolving credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks this “2016 refinancing credit agreement” provides the company with a 12 billion  5  year revolving credit facility and a 

4000 million  delayed draw term loan the “term loan” the company incurred approximately 33 million  of deferred financing cost related to the 2016 refinancing credit agreement the facility expires on june 22 2021  the 2016 refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed as described below at december 31 2017  the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of 354 million  of letters of credit of approximately 6790 million  subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 

the term loan was drawn on november 25 2016 the company incurred a 10  basis point commitment fee from june 22 2016  until the initial draw on november 25 2016 

under the 2016 refinancing credit agreement the company may elect a base rate of interest for us dollar denominated loans or for certain currencies an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” of interest or other rates appropriate for such currencies in any case “the alternate rate” the base rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus 050 per annum the pnc na prime rate or the daily libor rate plus 100  basis points plus a margin that ranges from 0  to 75  basis points the alternate rate is based on the quoted rates specific to the applicable currency plus a margin that ranges from 75  to 175  basis points both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to ebitda ratios the initial base rate margin is 0  basis points and the alternate rate margin is 175  basis points  

at december 31 2016 the weighted average interest rate on the company’s variable rate debt was 292  on january 12 2012 the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of 1500 million  the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is july 31 2013 and the termination date was november 7 2016 the impact of the interest rate swap agreement converted a portion of the company’s outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixedrate borrowing during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value was fixed at 1415  plus the alternate rate margin on june 5 2014 the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of 1500 million  the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is november 7 2016 and the termination date is december 19 2018 the impact of the interest rate swap agreement converts a portion of the company’s outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixedrate borrowing during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 256  plus the alternate rate margin as for these agreements the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparties are large financial institutions with excellent credit ratings and history of performance the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible 

the 2016 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2016 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 30  and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio of 325  the company is in compliance with the restrictions and covenants of the 2016 refinancing credit agreement and does not expect that these measurements will limit the company in executing our operating activities

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves pensions and other postretirement benefits stock based compensation and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 17 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories 

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring writedowns to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations for example based on the quantitative analysis performed as of october 1 2017 a decline in the terminal growth rate by 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by 334 million or an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by 984 million even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values necessitating no step 2 calculations see note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

warranty reserves 

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses 

accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits 

description the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for example a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense 12 million  or decrease expense 18 million  respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation 531 million  or decrease the obligation 672 million  respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense 30 million  if the actual asset values at december 31 2017  had been 1 lower the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease 02 million  a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would increase or decrease the 

expense less than 01 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would increase or decrease the obligation 03 million  

stockbased compensation 

description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new threeyear performance cycle with the most recently completed cycle being 20152017 no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock units vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts in the initial grant year of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period for example a 10 decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stockbased compensation expense by approximately 07 million  and 07 million  respectively 

income taxes 

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

revenue recognition 

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc 605 “revenue recognition” the company recognizes revenues on longterm contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting the unitsofdelivery method or other inputbased or outputbased measures as appropriate are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined certain preproduction costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts 

judgments and uncertainties revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers title has passed and the price for the product has been determined contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages for each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method the amount reported as revenue is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period due to the size duration and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of 

total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends business base and other economic projections factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements for longterm contracts revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined preproduction costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company’s progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2017  had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1 it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately 298 million a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of preproduction costs could be realized if the company’s estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled

interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variablerate debt the company’s variable rate debt represents 38 and 36 of total longterm debt at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively on an annual basis a 1 change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31 2017  would increase or decrease interest expense by about 71 million 

to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixedrate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts refer to “financial derivatives and hedging activities” in note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk

general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries george westinghouse founded the original westinghouse air brake co in 1869 when he invented the air brake westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” the company went public on the new york stock exchange in 1995 in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

in 2016 wabtec acquired majority ownership of faiveley transport sa “faiveley transport” a leading provider of valueadded integrated systems and services primarily for the global transit rail market for a purchase price of approximately 7465 million  based in france faiveley transport has roots to 1919 and became a leader in manufacturing pantographs automatic door mechanisms and air conditioning systems faiveley transport was listed on the paris stock exchange in 1994 and during the next 20 years acquired a number of rail industry leaders including sab wabco a specialist in railway braking systems and couplers faiveley transport had revenues of about 12 billion in 2016 wabtec believes that the acquisition of faiveley transport provides the following strategic benefits 

 today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment systems and services for the global freight and transit rail industries we believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on most us locomotives freight cars passenger transit cars and buses around the world in 2016  the company had sales of approximately 29 billion  and net income attributable to wabtec shareholders of about 3049 million  in 2016  sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 59  of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 54  of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and transit rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies in general trends such as increasing urbanization a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness an aging equipment fleet and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight and transit rail 

according to the 2016 edition of a market study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 100 billion and it is expected to grow at about 32 annually through 2021 the three largest geographic markets which represent about 80 of the total accessible market are europe north america and asia pacific over the next five years unife projects aboveaverage growth in asia pacific and europe due to overall economic growth and trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support the largest product segments of the market are rolling stock services and infrastructure which represent almost 90 of the accessible market over the next five years unife projects spending on rolling stock to grow at an aboveaverage rate due to increased investment in passenger transit vehicles unife estimates that the global installed base of locomotives is about 114000 units with about 32 in asia pacific about 25 in north america and about 18 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states wabtec estimates that 

about 3400 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2016 and it expects deliveries of about 3200 in 2017 unife estimates the global installed base of freight cars is about 55 million units with about 37 in north america about 26 in russiacis and about 20 in asia pacific wabtec estimates that about 108000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2016 and it expects deliveries of about 97000 in 2017 unife estimates the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 569000 units with about 43 in asia pacific about 32 in europe and about 14 in russiacis unife estimates that about 208000 new passenger transit vehicles were ordered annually from 20132015 and that about 184000 will be ordered annually from 20162018 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage continued investment in public mass transit france germany and the united kingdom are the largest western european transit markets representing almost twothirds of industry spending in the european union unife projects the western european rail market to grow at about 36 annually during the next five years led by investments in new rolling stock in france and germany significant investments are also expected in turkey the largest market in eastern europe about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in recent years the european commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the european rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements unife believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 55 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems 

growth in the asia pacific market has been driven mainly by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investments in freight rail rolling stock and infrastructure in australia to serve its mining and natural resources markets during the next five years unife expects india to make significant investments in rolling stock and infrastructure to modernize its rail system for example the country has awarded a 1000unit locomotive order to a us manufacturer unife expects the increased spending in india to offset decreased spending on veryhighspeed rolling stock in china during the next five years 

other key geographic markets include russiacis and africamiddle east with about 14 million freight cars and about 20000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest in both freight and transit rolling stock prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa is expected to continue to invest in new transit cars and new locomotives according to unife emerging markets are expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in its study unife also said it expects increased investment in digital tools for data and asset management and in rail control technologies both of which would improve efficiency in the global rail industry during the next five years unife said datadriven asset management tools have the potential to reduce equipment maintenance costs and improve asset utilization while rail control technologies have been focused on increasing track capacity improving operational efficiency and ensuring safer railway traffic wabtec offers products and services to help customers make ongoing investments in these initiatives 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight segment and the transit segment both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers the acquisition of faiveley transport significantly strengthened our capabilities and presence in the worldwide transit market 

the freight segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotives and freight cars supplies rail control and infrastructure products including electronics positive train control equipment and signal design and engineering services overhauls locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars and utilities demand is primarily driven by general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight carloadings investment in new technologies and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2016  the freight segment accounted for 53  of our total sales with about 59  of its sales in the us in 2016  slightly more than half of the freight segment’s sales were in aftermarket 

the transit segment mainly operating worldwide as faiveley transport primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically regional trains high speed trains subway cars lightrail vehicles and buses supplies rail control and infrastructure products including electronics positive train control equipment and signal design and engineering services builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes passenger transit vehicles customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of passenger transit vehicles and buses around the world demand in the transit market is primarily driven by general economic conditions passenger ridership levels government spending on public transportation and investment in new rolling stock in 2016  the transit segment accounted for 47  of our total sales with about 33  of its sales in the us about twothirds of the transit segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market the addition of faiveley transport’s key products strengthens wabtec’s presence in the following areas highspeed braking and door systems heating ventilation and air conditioning systems pantographs and power collection information systems platform screen doors and gates couplers and aftermarket services maintenance and spare parts geographically wabtec’s presence in the european and asia pacific transit markets has been strengthened significantly through the acquisition of faiveley transport 

following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments 

specialty products  electronics 

 brake products 

 remanufacturing overhaul and build 

 transit products 



 we have become a leader in the freight and transit rail industries by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments supported by our technical staff of over 2900  engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers 

over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in the us for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  or positive train control “ptc” technology which offers safety benefits to the rail industry ptc includes onboard locomotive computer and related software which must be installed on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us to meet the requirements of a 2008 rail safety bill with our electronic train management system ®  we are the leading supplier of this onboard train control equipment and we are working with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology by the deadline of december 31 2018 in 2016  wabtec recorded about 345 million  of revenue from freight and transit train control and signaling projects which includes ptc new products introduced for the transit market in recent years include hvac inverter integrated solutions brake discs and platform doors and gates

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 



 business strategy 

using wep we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wep and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs such as global sourcing and supply chain management these practices enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments we also rely on functional experts within the company across various disciplines to train coach and share best practices throughout the corporation while benchmarking against bestinclass competitors and peers over time we believe the principles of wep will enable us to continue to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 

recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

in addition to the faiveley transport acquisition wabtec has completed the following acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above 

 backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 40 billion  at december 31 2016  for 2016  about 59  of total sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or canceled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  and the expected year of completion are as follows 



engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we invested about 714 million  712 million  and 619 million  respectively on product development and improvement activities the engineering resources of the company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts across the 

corporation we have established multiple centers of competence which have specialized technical expertise in various disciplines and product areas 

our engineering and development program includes investment in train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads we have also developed advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other industry suppliers 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have 2382  active patents worldwide and on average file for approximately 150  new patents each year we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property we also follow the product development practices of our competitors to monitor any possible patent infringement by them and to evaluate their strategies and plans 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

we provide products and services for more than 500 customers worldwide our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout north america europe asia pacific south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars passenger transit vehicles and buses and companies that lease and maintain such equipment 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  our top five customers accounted for 23  of net sales csx corporation trinity industries the bnsf railway the greenbrier companies and norfolk southern railway no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe we hold a leading market share for many of our core product lines globally our market shares are typically higher in north america and lower in other regions of the world depending on specific product lines and geographies we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines and geographies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel a division of caterpillar ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america no individual 

company is our principal competitor in all of our operating locations the largest competitor for brake and transit products is knorr in addition our competitors often include smaller local suppliers in most international markets 

employees 

at december 31 2016  we had approximately 20000  fulltime employees approximately 35  of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are outside north america and these agreements are generally effective from 2017 through 2019 agreements expiring at various times during 2017 cover approximately 20  of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations and standards of governments and other agencies in the us and around the world these entities typically govern equipment safety and interoperability standards for freight rail and passenger transit rolling stock oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers new products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy as a result of these regulations and requirements we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries the governing bodies include the fra and aar in the us and the international union of railways “uic” and the european railway agencies euar in europe also in europe the european committees for standardization cen and cenelec continually draft new european standards which cover for example the reliability availability maintainability and safety of railways systems to guarantee interoperability in europe the european union for railway agencies is responsible for defining and implementing technical standards of interoperability tsi which covers areas such as infrastructure energy rolling stock telematic applications traffic operation and management subsystems noise pollution and waste generation protection against fire and smoke and system safety 

most countries and regions in which wabtec does business have similar rulemaking bodies in russia a gostr certificate of conformity is mandatory for all products related to the safety of individuals on russian territory in china any product or system sold on the chinese market must have been certified in accordance with national standards in the local indian market most products are covered by regulations patterned after aar and uic standards 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be affected by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period quarterly results can also be affected by the timing of projects in backlog and by project delays 

environmental matters 

additional information on environmental matters is included in note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

risk factors 

tableend

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  our top five customers accounted for 23  of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a global competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to customer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ptc mandate from the us federal government which requires the use of onboard locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018 

for the year ended december 31 2016  we had sales of about 345 million  related to train control and signaling which includes ptc in 2015 the industrys ptc deadline was extended by three years through december 31 2018 which also included the ability of railroads to request an additional two years for compliance with the approval of the department of transportation if certain parameters are met this could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of government spending on railway projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2016  approximately 54  of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future with the acquisition of faiveley transport we anticipate over 60 of our consolidated net sales will be to customers outside of the us our global headquarters for the transit group is located in france and we currently conduct other international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland russia spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with most other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

the occurrence of litigation in which we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable 

from time to time the company is subject to litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to our business customers suppliers creditors shareholders product liability intellectual property infringement warranty claims or environmentalrelated matters due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation commercial disputes or other legal or regulatory proceedings the company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome including the outcome of any related appeals we may incur significant expense to defend or otherwise address current or future claims any litigation even a claim without merit could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations although we maintain insurance policies for certain risks we cannot make assurances that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to potential future claims or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices or at all 

the company is subject to national and international laws and regulations such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act the french law n° 20161691 sapin ii and the uk bribery act relating to its business and its employees despite the companys policies procedures and compliance programs its internal controls and compliance systems may not be able to protect the company from prohibited acts willfully committed by its employees agents or business partners that would violate such applicable laws and regulations any such improper acts could damage the companys reputation subject it to civil or criminal judgments fines or penalties and could otherwise disrupt the companys business and as a result could materially adversely impact the companys business financial condition or results of operations 

if we are not able to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we may be adversely affected 

our success can be impacted by our ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights we rely primarily on patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and unfair competition laws as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights however a significant portion of our 

technology is not patented and we may be unable or may not seek to obtain patent protection for this technology moreover existing us legal standards relating to the validity enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights offer only limited protection may not provide us with any competitive advantages and may be challenged by third parties the laws of countries other than the united states may be even less protective of intellectual property rights accordingly despite our efforts we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or otherwise gaining access to our technology if we fail to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights then our business results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 35  of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2017 through 2019 agreements expiring at various times during 2017 cover approximately 20  of the company’s workforce failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2016  we had total debt of 18928 million  if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under our 2016 refinancing credit agreement the 7962 million  currently borrowed under this facility and the 7475 million  3450 senior notes and the 2483 million  4375 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 the indenture for our 7475 million  3450 senior notes due in 2026 our 2483 million  4375 senior notes due in 2023 and our 2016 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the 2016 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2016 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments 

loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to ebitda ratio 

the indentures under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2015 and 2016 we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of 9960 million  which included our acquisition of a 51 controlling stake in faiveley transport for 7465 million  additionally we launched a tender offer for the remaining publicly traded shares with the intention of acquiring 100 ownership of faiveley transport and currently having a 78 controlling interest although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 30  countries in 2016  about 54  of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec excellence program and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including product innovation and new technologies global and market expansion aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtec’s product and services in its 2016 study unife estimates the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 100 billion and it is expected to grow at about 32 annually through 2021 with the highest expected growth rates in asia pacific and europe 

in north america the aar compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry including carloadings which is generally referred to as “rail traffic” based on changes in rail traffic trends railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars in 2016 north american carloadings decreased 45 including a 72 decrease in commodity carloadings and a 15 decrease in intermodal carloadings deliveries of new locomotives decreased 20 and deliveries of new freight cars decreased 27 in 2017 we expect locomotive and freight car deliveries to be lower than in 2016 unife projects an annual growth rate of about 23 in north america but the actual figure depends on the growth of the economy 

in north america the american public transportation association apta compiles ridership statistics and trends based on preliminary figures for 2016 ridership decreased about 10 in the us and was about flat in canada ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities which use these funds along with state and local money primarily for equipment maintenance in 2015 the us congress passed a new fiveyear transportation funding bill which includes annual spending increases a majority of the money that transit agencies spend to purchase new equipment or infrastructure comes from the federal government 

wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the us particularly in europe and asia pacific to gauge activity in these markets we monitor trends in rail traffic and the spending plans of our customers in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is significantly larger than the transit market in the us our presence in the uk and continental europe and especially the acquisition of a majority ownership of faiveley transport has positioned the company to take advantage of this market unife projects the western european rail market to grow annually by about 36 during the next five years with france and germany expected to invest in new rolling stock unife projects the market in asiapacific the world’s second largest according to the study to grow annually by about 54 primarily reflecting strong spending in china other growth markets around the world according to unife include latin america projected to grow at about 21 africamiddle east projected to grow at about 19 and russiacis projected to grow at about 15 actual growth rates will be affected by the general global economic conditions and specific economic conditions in each market through wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures wabtec has a presence in every key freight rail and passenger transit market around the world 

in 2016 and beyond general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally will have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies 

developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

net sales decreased by 3768 million  to 29312 million  in 2016  from 33080 million  in 2015  the decrease is primarily due to lower sales for specialty products and electronics of 4027 million  and lower brake products sales of 551 million  due to decreased demand for freight products attributable to lower freight car and locomotive builds and train control and signaling products and services and lower other products sales of 269 million  from decreased demand for freight spare part kits acquisitions increased sales 1892 million  and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales 711 million  

freight segment sales decreased by 5116 million  or 249  primarily due to a 4383 million  decrease for specialty products and electronics sales from lower demand for freight original equipment rail products and train control and signaling products attributable to lower freight car and locomotive builds a decrease of 507 million  for brake products sales from 

lower demand for original equipment brakes and aftermarket services a decrease of 337 million  for remanufacturing overhaul and build sales due to a large locomotive rebuild contract that completed in 2016 and a decrease of 269 million  for other product sales from decreased demand for freight spare part kits acquisitions increased sales by 551 million  and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by 172 million  

transit segment sales increased by 1348 million  or 108  primarily due to a 356 million  increase for specialty products and electronics from higher demand for original equipment conduction systems and current collectors and an increase of 227 million  for remanufacturing overhaul and build sales from higher demand for aftermarket locomotive builds acquisitions increased sales by 1341 million  and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by 539 million  

cost of sales and gross profit the following table shows the major components of cost of sales for the periods indicated 

cost of sales decreased by 2532 million  to 20069 million  in 2016  compared to 22602 million  in the same period of 2015  for the twelve months ended 2016  cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 684  compared to 683  in the same period of 2015  

freight segment cost of sales decreased 05  as a percentage of sales to 658  in 2016 compared to 663  for the same period of 2015 the decrease as a percentage of sales is primarily related to sales with lower material content lower overall material costs due to ongoing sourcing efforts and decreases in various commodity prices partially offset by an increase in overhead costs as a percentage of sales which is primarily due to certain fixed overhead costs 

transit segment cost of sales decreased 03  as a percentage of sales to 714  in 2016 compared to 717  for the same period in 2015 the decrease is primarily due to better margin performance from prior year acquisitions and ongoing sourcing savings these benefits were partially offset by 138 million of costs related to adjustments on certain longterm contracts 

included in cost of sales is warranty expense the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters warranty expense was 289 million  in 2016 compared to 354 million  in 2015  

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses 



total operating expenses were 159  and 134  of sales for 2016 and 2015 respectively selling general and administrative expenses increased 244 million  or 70  primarily due to 389 million of costs related to the faiveley acquisition and 54 million in costs related to restructuring activity these costs were partially offset by lower incentive and noncash compensation expense and the effects of foreign exchange engineering expense was consistent with the prior year amortization expense increased 10 million  due to amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 

the following table shows our segment operating expenses 



freight segment operating expenses decreased 261 million  or 125  in 2016  and increased 160 basis points to 118  of sales the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced sales volumes and realized benefits associated with the cost saving initiatives undertaken in 2016 partially offset by 88 million of incremental operating expenses from acquisitions 

transit segment operating expenses increased 202 million  or 98  in 2016  and decreased 10 basis points to 163  of sales the increase is primarily related to 262 million of incremental operating expenses related to acquisitions and 71 million related to the faiveley transport transaction this increase is partially offset by lower operating expenses due to foreign exchange 

corporate nonallocated operating expenses increased 315 million  in 2016  primarily due to 318 million of costs related to the faiveley acquisition partially offset by realized benefits from cost saving initiatives in 2016 

interest expense net overall interest expense net increased 257 million  in 2016  due to a higher overall debt balance in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily related to the faiveley transport acquisition and 149 million of debt refinancing costs refer to note 8 of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on debt 

other expense net other expense net decreased 23 million  to 30 million  for 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to foreign exchange adjustments 

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 241  and 319  in 2016  and 2015  respectively the decrease in the effective rate is primarily the result of an enacted tax rate change which reduces the corporate income tax rate in france and a higher earnings mix in lower tax rate jurisdictions partially offset by 2016 transaction charges related to the acquisition of faiveley transport that are not deductible 

2015  compared to 2014   

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 



the following table shows the major components of the change in sales in 2015  from 2014  



net sales increased by 2635 million to 33080 million in 2015 from 30445 million in 2014 the increase is primarily due to a 1565 million increase for specialty products and electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment products and aftermarket electronic and ptc electronic products acquisitions increased sales 2628 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales 1518 million 

freight segment sales increased by 3232 million or 187 primarily due to a 1457 million increase for specialty products and electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment rail products ptc electronics and aftermarket rail products and 804 million for remanufacturing overhaul and build products due to higher demand for aftermarket locomotive builds acquisitions increased sales by 1455 million and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by 496 million 

transit segment sales decreased by 597 million or 45 due to a decrease of 1023 million related to unfavorable foreign exchange a 539 million decrease in remanufacturing overhaul and build from lower demand for original transit locomotive because a multiyear project was substantially completed in 2014 and a 231 million decrease for brake products from lower demand for braking products in europe and braking systems in north america these decreases were partially offset by 1173 million in sales from acquisitions 

cost of sales and gross profit the following table shows the major components of cost of sales for the periods indicated 

cost of sales increased by 1517 million to 22602 million in 2015 compared to 21085 million in the same period of 2014 for the twelve months ended 2015 cost of sales as a percentage of sales was 683 compared to 693 in the same period of 2014 the decrease of cost of sales as a percentage of sales is due to lower material costs primarily due to lower original equipment transit locomotive sales and higher specialty product and electronics sales 

freight segment cost of sales increased 05 as a percentage of sales to 663 in 2015 compared to 658 for the same period of 2014 the increase is primarily related to slightly lower margins related to recent acquisitions and cost overruns on a project nearing completion partially offset by higher specialty products and electronics sales 

  

transit segment cost of sales decreased 22 as a percentage of sales to 717 in 2015 compared to 739 for the same period in 2014 the decrease in 2015 is primarily due to lower material costs associated with lower original equipment locomotive sales and lower original equipment and aftermarket brake product sales which carry higher raw material content partially offset by additional costs incurred on the closeout of several projects 

included in cost of sales is warranty expense the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters warranty expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 increased 13 million to 354 million from 341 million in 2014 primarily due to increased sales 

gross profit for the twelve months ended december 31 2015 increased 1118 million to 10478 million from 9360 million for the twelve months ended december 2014 and the gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 317 from 307 at december 31 2014 these increases are due to higher sales volume favorable sales mix and the reasons discussed above 

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses 



total operating expenses were 134 for both the years ending december 31 2015 and 2014 selling general and administrative expenses increased 228 million or 70 primarily due to 247 million of expenses from acquisitions partially offset by lower incentive and noncash compensation expense and the effects of foreign exchange engineering 

expense increased by 93 million or 151 primarily due to 35 million of expenses from acquisitions the remainder of the increase can be attributed to the company concentrating resources on new product development specifically in the electronics market costs related to engineering for specific customer contracts are included in cost of sales amortization expense decreased 08 million due to lower amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 

the following table shows our segment operating expenses 



freight segment operating expenses increased 198 million or 105 in 2015 but decreased 70 basis points to 102 of sales the increase primarily relates to 84 million of incremental operating expenses from acquisitions and 79 million for engineering attributable to the company concentrating resources on new product development 

transit segment operating expenses increased 86 million or 44 in 2015 and increased 140 basis points to 164 of sales the increase is primarily related to 198 million of incremental operating expenses related to acquisitions this increase is partially offset by lower operating expenses due to foreign exchange 

corporate nonallocated operating expenses increased 29 million in 2015 primarily due to higher administrative and transaction costs associated with growing our business 

income from operations income from operations totaled 6076 million or 184 of sales in 2015 compared to 5271 million or 173 of sales in 2014 income from operations increased due to higher sales volume partially offset by increased operating expenses discussed above 

interest expense net overall interest expense net decreased 07 million in 2015 due to lower average debt balances 

other expense net other expense net increased 36 million to 53 million for 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to foreign exchange adjustments 

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 319 and 308 in 2015 and 2014 respectively the increase in the effective rate is primarily the result of a higher earnings mix in higher tax rate jurisdictions 

net income net income for 2015 increased 133 or 469 million to 3986 million compared to 2014 the increase in net income is due to the reasons discussed above

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves pensions and other postretirement benefits stock based compensation and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 17 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories 

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring writedowns to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations for example based on the quantitative analysis performed as of october 1 2016 a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by 477 million or an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by 1191 million even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values necessitating no step 2 calculations see note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

warranty reserves 

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses 

accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits 

description the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for example a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense 18 million or decrease expense 14 million respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation 634 million or decrease the obligation 498 million respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense 27 million if the actual asset values at december 31 2016  had been 1 lower the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease 02 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would increase or decrease the expense less than 01 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would increase or decrease the obligation 03 million 

stockbased compensation 

description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new threeyear performance cycle with the most recently completed cycle being 20142016 no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock units vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts in the initial grant year of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period for example a 10 decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stockbased compensation expense by approximately 08 million  and 08 million  respectively 

income taxes 

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs 

from the recorded amount a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

revenue recognition 

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc605 “revenue recognition” the company recognizes revenues on longterm contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting the unitsofdelivery method or other inputbased or outputbased measures as appropriate are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined certain preproduction costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts 

judgments and uncertainties revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers title has passed and the price for the product has been determined contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages for each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method the amount reported as revenues is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period due to the size duration and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends business base and other economic projections factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements for longterm contracts revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined preproduction costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company’s progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2016  had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1 it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately 121 million a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of preproduction costs could be realized if the company’s estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars subway cars and buses and on many of these vehicles around the world in 2015  the company had sales of approximately 33 billion  and net income of about 3986 million  in 2015  sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 62  of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 47  of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems 

according to a recent study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 100 billion and it is expected to grow at about 27 annually through 2019 the three largest markets which represent about 75 of the total market are europe asiapacific and north america unife projects the overall market to remain stable through 2020 as emerging markets show aboveaverage growth due to overall economic growth and trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support while developed markets grow at a slower pace unife projects growth in all major product segments with rail control and services expected to grow the fastest at about 3 each 

by using various industry publications and market studies we estimate that the global installed base of locomotives is about 110000 units with about 35 in asiapacific about 25 in russiacis commonwealth of independent states and about 20 in north america we estimate the global installed base of freight cars is about 52 million units with about 30 each in russiacis and north america and about 20 in asiapacific we estimate the global installed base of transit cars is about 330000 units with about 55 in asiapacific about 20 in europe and about 10 in russia 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 55 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in 2015 the association of american railroads “aar” reported total carloads decreased 22 as a 21 increase in intermodal traffic was more than offset by a 58 decrease in commodities carloads generally a decrease in carloads reflects a slowing economy deliveries of new locomotives were about 1200 units in 2015 compared to about 1500 in 2014 and the average of about 1200 in the past 10 years deliveries of new freight cars were about 82000 units in 2015 compared to about 67000 in 2014 and the average of about 50000 in the past 10 years 

in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues the new york city region is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems in 2015 the us congress passed a fiveyear transportation funding bill that includes transit spending of about 118 billion in fiscal 2016 an increase of about 10 compared to the prior year the number of new transit cars delivered in 2015 was about 850 compared to about the same in 2014 the number of new buses delivered in 2015 was about 4600 compared to about the same in 2014 in the past 10 years the average number of new transit cars delivered annually is about 800 and the average number of new buses delivered annually is about 4700    public transit ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities which use these funds along with state and local money primarily for equipment and system maintenance based on preliminary figures from the american public transportation association ridership on us transit vehicles decreased about 10 in 2015 

outside of north america countries such as australia brazil china india russia and south africa have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world some governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies according to unife emerging markets are expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit france germany the united kingdom and italy are the largest transit markets representing about twothirds of passenger traffic in the european union unife projected the western european rail market to grow at about 20 annually in the next few years with the united kingdom and france expected to invest in new rolling stock according to the uk’s office of rail regulation passenger rail usage has steadily increased in the past decade with the office reporting a 14 increase in second quarter ridership in its most recent quarterly report for the same time period the office also reported a decrease of 165 in freight volume driven by a reduction in coal shipments germany has the largest rail network in europe about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in the first nine months of 2015 the federal statistical office of germany reported a 21 decrease in freight volumes compared to the same period in 2014 for the first six months of 2015 sncf french national railway reported an increase of 40 in revenue for local and regional ridership and flat freightrelated revenue we estimate that the european rail market consists of about 11000 locomotives about 750000 freight cars and about 72000 passenger transit cars 

the asiapacific market is now the secondlargest geographic segment according to unife this market consists primarily of china india and australia growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investments in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries we estimate that this market consists of 35000 locomotives and about 10 million freight cars china is expected to increase spending on rail infrastructure and equipment as it resumes investment in highspeed rail programs in its most recent report the indian government reported that in the first six months of its fiscal 2015 freight rail volume increased about 26 and earnings from passenger rail traffic increased about 85 india is expected to increase spending significantly in future years as it seeks to modernize its rail system for example it recently awarded a 1000unit locomotive order to a us manufacturer 

other key geographic markets include russiacis south africa and brazil with about 15 million freight cars and about 28000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest significantly in new rolling stock and infrastructure russian railways a stateowned company provides both freight and passenger transportation in 2015 russian railways announced a decrease of 12 in freight loadings and a decrease of 44 in passenger ridership south africa in 2012 announced a major program to invest in its freight rail and passenger transit infrastructure during the next 20 years as part of this program prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa plans to purchase about 3600 new transit cars and about 1000 new locomotives brazil has also been investing in its passenger transport systems in advance of hosting the 2016 olympics 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight segment and the transit segment both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers 

the freight segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotive and freight cars supplies railway electronics positive train control equipment signal design and engineering services builds switcher 

locomotives rebuilds freight locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars and utilities as discussed previously demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2015  the freight segment accounted for 62  of our total sales with about 81  of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers in 2015  slightly more than half of the freight segment’s sales were in aftermarket 

the transit segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world as discussed previously demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership in 2015  the transit segment accounted for 38  of our total sales with about 39  of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers about twothirds of the transit segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market 

following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments 

specialty products  electronics 

 brake products 

 remanufacturing overhaul and build 

 transit products 

 we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments supported by our technical staff of over 1500  engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers 

over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of positive train control “ptc” technology which includes onboard locomotive computer and related software on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us with our electronic train management system ®  we are the leading supplier of this onboard train control equipment and we are working with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology the rail safety bill included a deadline of december 31 2015 for ptc 

implementation but the deadline has been extended until the end of 2018 the deadline extension is expected to affect the rate of industry spending on this technology in 2015  wabtec recorded about 400 million  of revenue from freight and transit ptc projects

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

 business strategy 

using wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

wabtec has completed certain significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above 

 backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 21 billion  at december 31 2015  for 2015  about 62  of total sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other 

reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  and the expected year of completion are as follows 



engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we invested about 712 million  619 million  and 463 million  respectively on product development and improvement activities the engineering resources of the company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts 

our engineering and development program includes investment in train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads we are also investing in technology such as advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other industry suppliers 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have 2312  active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe asia south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses and lessors of such equipment 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2015  our top five customers accounted for 22  of net sales the bnsf railway csx corporation general electric transportation trinity industries and union pacific corporation no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel a division of caterpillar ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america no individual company is our principal competitor in all of our operating locations the largest competitors for brake and transit products are faiveley transport and knorr in addition our competitors often include smaller local suppliers in most international markets 

employees 

at december 31 2015  we had approximately 13000  fulltime employees approximately 30  of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are outside north america and these agreements are generally effective from 2016 through 2018 agreements expiring at various times during 2016 cover approximately 26  of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of governments and other agencies in the us and around the world these entities typically govern equipment and safety standards for freight rail and passenger transit rolling stock oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers new products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy as a result of these regulations and requirements we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries the governing bodies include fra and aar in the us the international union of railways “uic” and the european railway agency in europe the federal agency of railway transport in russia the agencia nacional de transportes terrestres in brazil the national railway administration formerly the ministry of railway in china and the ministry of railways in india 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be affected by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period 

environmental matters

risk factors 

tableend

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2015  our top five customers accounted for 22  of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ptc mandate from the us federal government which requires the use of onboard locomotive computers and software by the end of 2018 

for the year ended december 31 2015  we had sales of about 400 million  related to ptc in 2015 the industrys ptc deadline was extended by three years which could change the timing of our revenues and could cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales have been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2015  approximately 47  of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland russia spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with most other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 30  of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2016 through 2018 agreements expiring at various times during 2016 cover approximately 26  of the company’s workforce failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in 

the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us although we cannot guarantee that this will continue to occur 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2015  we had total debt of 6957 million  if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under our 2013 refinancing credit agreement the 4450 million  currently borrowed under this facility and the 2500 million  4375 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 the indenture for our 250 million  4375 senior notes due in 2023 and our 2013 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the 2013 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2013 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2014 and 2015 we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of 4247 million  although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 20  countries in 2015  about 47  of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec performance system and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity while transit markets are driven primarily by government funding and passenger ridership changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtec’s product and services in its 2014  2019 study unife projected annual growth of about 27 in the worldwide rail supply market over the next several years with the highest expected growth rates in africa the middle east and latin america 

in north america the aar compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry including revenue tonmiles and carloadings which are generally referred to as “rail traffic” based on changes in rail traffic trends railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars in 2015 north american carloadings decreased 22 including a 58 decrease in commodity carloadings and a 21 increase in intermodal carloadings deliveries of new locomotives decreased 20 and deliveries of new freight cars increased 22 in 2016 we expect locomotive and freight car deliveries to be lower than in 2015 unife projected an annual growth rate of about 30 in north america but the actual figure depends on the growth of the economy 

in north america the american public transportation association apta compiles ridership statistics and trends based on preliminary figures for 2015 ridership decreased about 10 in the us and about 10 in canada ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities which use these funds along with state and local money primarily for equipment maintenance in 2015 the us congress passed a new fiveyear transportation funding bill which includes an increase in spending of about 100 in the first year and smaller increases in future years a majority of the money that transit agencies spend to purchase new equipment or infrastructure comes from the federal government 

wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the us particularly in europe asiapacific and south america to gauge activity in these markets we monitor trends in rail traffic and the spending plans of our customers in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is larger than the transit market in the us our presence in the uk germany and italy has positioned the company to take advantage of this market unife projected the western european rail market to grow annually by about 20 in the next few years with the united kingdom and france expected to invest in new rolling stock unife projected the market in asiapacific the world’s second largest according to the study to grow annually by about 40 primarily reflecting strong spending in china in recent years other growth markets around the world according to unife include latin america projected to grow at about 50 and the commonwealth of independent states projected to grow at about 10 actual growth rates will be affected by the general global economic conditions and specific economic conditions in each market through wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures wabtec has a presence in every key freight rail and passenger transit market around the world 

in 2016 and beyond general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally will have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies 

developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

net sales increased by 2635 million  to 33080 million  in 2015  from 30445 million  in 2014  the increase is primarily due to a 1565 million  increase for specialty products and electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment products and aftermarket electronic and ptc electronic products acquisitions increased sales 2628 million  and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales 1518 million  

freight segment sales increased by 3232 million  or 187  primarily due to a 1457 million  increase for specialty products and electronics sales from higher demand for freight original equipment rail products ptc electronics and aftermarket rail products and 804 million  for remanufacturing overhaul and build products due to higher demand for aftermarket locomotive builds acquisitions increased sales by 1455 million  and unfavorable foreign exchange decreased sales by 496 million  

transit segment sales decreased by 597 million  or 45  due to a decrease of 1023 million  related to unfavorable foreign exchange a 539 million  decrease in remanufacturing overhaul and build from lower demand for original transit locomotive because a multiyear project was substantially completed in 2014 and a 231 million  decrease for brake products from lower demand for braking products in europe and braking systems in north america these decreases were partially offset by 1173 million  in sales from acquisitions

transit segment cost of sales decreased 22  as a percentage of sales to 717  in 2015 compared to 739  for the same period in 2014 the decrease in 2015 is primarily due to lower material costs associated with lower original equipment locomotive sales and lower original equipment and aftermarket brake product sales which carry higher raw material content partially offset by additional costs incurred on the closeout of several projects 

included in cost of sales is warranty expense the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters warranty expense for the twelve months ended december 31 2015  increased 13 million  to 354 million  from 341 million  in 2014  primarily due to increased sales

the 2013 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2013 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 30  and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325  the company does not expect that these measurements will limit the company in executing its operating activities see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves pensions and other postretirement benefits stock based compensation and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 3 and 19 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 3 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories 

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring writedowns to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations for example based on the last quantitative analysis performed as of october 1 2013 a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by 1752 million or an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by 4829 million even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values necessitating no step 2 calculations see note 3 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

warranty reserves 

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses 

accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits 

description the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of 

return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for example a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense 20 million or decrease expense 23 million respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation 347 million or decrease the obligation 426 million respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense 21 million respectively if the actual asset values at december 31 2015  had been 1 lower the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease 01 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would increase the expense 004 million or decrease expense 002 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would increase or decrease the obligation 03 million respectively 

stockbased compensation 

description the company has issued incentive stock units to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new threeyear performance cycle with the most recently commenced cycle being 20132015 no incentive stock units will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock units vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts in the initial grant year of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period for example a 10 decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stockbased compensation expense by approximately 14 million  and 14 million  respectively 

income taxes 

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

revenue recognition 

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc605 “revenue recognition” the company recognizes revenues on longterm contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting the unitsofdelivery method or other inputbased or outputbased measures as appropriate are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined certain preproduction costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts 

judgments and uncertainties revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers title has passed and the price for the product has been determined contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages for each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method the amount reported as revenues is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period due to the size duration and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends business base and other economic projections factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements for longterm contracts revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined preproduction costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company’s progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2015  had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1 it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately 122 million a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of preproduction costs could be realized if the company’s estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled

general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars subway cars and buses and on many of these vehicles around the world in 2014 the company had sales of approximately 304 billion and net income of about 3517 million in 2014 sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 61 of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 50 of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffic volumes as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems 

according to a recent study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 100 billion and it is expected to grow at about 27 annually through 2019 the three largest markets which represent about 75 of the total market are europe asiapacific and north america unife projects the overall market to remain stable through 2020 as emerging markets show aboveaverage growth due to overall economic growth and trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility deregulation investments in new technologies energy and environmental issues and increasing government support while developed markets grow at a slower pace unife projects growth in all major product segments with rail control and services expected to grow the fastest at about 3 each

by using various industry publications and market studies we estimate that the global installed base of locomotives is about 110000 units with about 35 in asiapacific about 25 in russiacis and about 20 in north america we estimate the global installed base of freight cars is about 52 million units with about 30 each in russiacis and north america and about 20 in asiapacific we estimate the global installed base of transit cars is about 330000 units with about 55 in asiapacific about 20 in europe and about 10 in russia

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 55 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in 2014 the association of american railroads “aar” reported total carloads increased 44 including a 54 increase in intermodal traffic which generally reflected a growing economy deliveries of new locomotives were about 1450 units in 2014 compared to about 1300 in 2013 and the average of about 1200 in the past 10 years deliveries of new freight cars were about 67000 units in 2014 compared to about 53000 in 2013 and the average of about 50000 in the past 10 years

in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues the new york city region is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems in 2014 the us congress passed a bill that includes transit spending of about 11 billion in fiscal 2015 an increase of about 2 the number of new transit cars delivered in 2014 was about 850 compared to about 1000 in 2013 the number of new buses delivered in 2014 was about 4600 compared to about the same in 2013 in the past 10 years the average number of new transit cars delivered annually is about 800 and the average number of new buses delivered annually is about 4700 public transit ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities which use these funds along with state and local money primarily for equipment and system maintenance based on preliminary figures from the american public transportation association ridership on us transit vehicles increased about 09 in 2014

outside of north america countries such as australia brazil china india russia and south africa have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world some governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies according to unife emerging markets are expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit france germany the united kingdom and italy are the largest transit markets representing about twothirds of passenger traffic in the european union unife projects the western european rail market to grow at about 20 in the next few years with the united kingdom and france expected to invest in new rolling stock according to the uk’s office of rail regulation passenger rail usage has steadily increased in the past decade with the office reporting a 44 increase in second quarter ridership in its most recent quarterly report for the same time period the office also reported an decrease of 80 in freight volume driven by a reduction in coal shipments germany has the largest rail network in europe about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in the first nine months of 2014 the federal statistical office of germany reported a 08 increase in freight volumes compared to the same period in 2013 for the first nine months of 2014 sncf french national railway reported an increase of 34 in revenue for local and regional ridership and an increase of about 08 in freightrelated revenue we estimate that the european rail market consists of about 11000 locomotives about 750000 freight cars and about 72000 passenger transit cars 

the asiapacific market is now the secondlargest geographic segment according to unife this market consists primarily of china india and australia growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries as well as in australia we estimate that this market consists of about 35000 locomotives and about 10 million freight cars china is expected to increase spending on rail infrastructure and equipment in 2015 as it resumes investment in highspeed rail programs in its most recent report the indian government reported that in the first nine months of its fiscal 2014 freight rail traffic increased about 53 and passenger rail traffic decreased about 14 india is expected to increase spending significantly in 2015 as it seeks to modernize its rail system 

other key geographic markets include russiacis south africa and brazil with about 15 million freight cars and about 28000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest significantly in new rolling stock and infrastructure russian railways a stateowned company provides both freight and passenger transportation in 2014 russian railways announced a decrease of 08 in freight loadings and a decrease of 1 in passenger ridership south africa in 2012 announced a major program to invest in its freight rail and passenger transit infrastructure during the next 20 years as part of this program prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa plans to purchase about 3600 new transit cars and about 1000 new locomotives brazil has also been investing in its passenger transport systems in advance of hosting the 2016 2016 olympics

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight segment and the transit segment both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers 

the freight segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotive and freight cars  supplies railway electronics positive train control equipment signal design and engineering services builds switcher locomotives rebuilds freight locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars and utilities as discussed previously demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2014 the freight segment accounted for 57 of our total sales with about 75 of its sales in north 

america and the remainder to international customers in 2014 slightly more than half of the freight segment’s sales were in aftermarket 

the transit segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world as discussed previously demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership in 2014 the transit segment accounted for 43 of our total sales with about 45 of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers about twothirds of the transit segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market 

following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments 

specialty products  electronics 

















brake products 





remanufacturing overhaul and build 





transit products 







we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments supported by our technical staff of over 1200 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers 

over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of positive train control “ptc” technology which includes onboard locomotive computer and related software on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us with our electronic train management system ®  we are the leading supplier of this onboard train control equipment and we are working with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology the rail safety bill included a deadline of december 31 2015 for ptc implementation but railroads and transit authorities have stated in recent years that they cannot achieve full implementation by that deadline in early 2014 the aar said the railroads had equipped about half of the required locomotives with ptc equipment various bills have been introduced in congress to 

extend the deadline but to date there has been no change an extension of the deadline could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology in 2014 wabtec recorded about 290 million of revenue from freight and transit ptc projects

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 











business strategy 

using wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 









recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

wabtec has completed certain significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above 















backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 232 billion at december 31 2014 for 2014 about 61 of total sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 and the expected year of completion are as follows 



engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we invested about 619 million 463 million and 413 million respectively on product development and improvement activities the engineering resources of the company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts 

our engineering and development program includes investment in train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads we are also investing in technology such as advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other industry suppliers 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have 2241 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe asia south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses and lessors of such equipment 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2014 our top five customers accounted for 17 of net sales the massachusetts bay transportation authority general electric transportation csx corporation trinity industries and union pacific corporation no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel a division of caterpillar ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america no individual company is our principal competitor in all of our operating locations the largest competitors for brake and transit products are faiveley transport and knorr in addition our competitors often include smaller local suppliers in most international markets

employees 

at december 31 2014 we had approximately 12600 fulltime employees approximately 28 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are outside north america and these agreements are generally effective from 2015 through 2017 agreements expiring at various times during 2015 cover approximately 21 of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of governments and other agencies in the us and around the world these entities typically govern equipment and safety standards for freight rail and passenger transit rolling stock oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers new products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy as a result of these regulations and requirements we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries the governing bodies include the fra and aar in the us the the international union of railways “uic” and the european railway agency in europe the federal agency of railway transport in russia the agencia nacional de transportes terrestres in brazil the national railway administration formerly the ministry of railway china and the ministry of railways in india

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be affected by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period 

environmental matters 

information on environmental matters is included in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

risk factors 

tableend

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2014 our top five customers accounted for 17 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 









we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ptc mandate from the us federal government which requires the use of onboard locomotive computers and software by december 31 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2014 we had sales of about 290 million related to ptc in recent years the railroads and transit authorities have stated they cannot achieve full implementation of ptc by the deadline and various bills have been introduced to extend it but to date there has been no change in the deadline should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing scope or requirements of the safety bill there could be an adverse impact on our revenues in future periods and would cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales have been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of our customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2014 approximately 50 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland russia spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 















in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with most other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 28 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2015 through 2017 agreements expiring at various times during 2015 cover approximately 21 of the company’s workforce failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2014 we had total debt of 5218 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2013 refinancing credit agreement the 2700 million currently borrowed under this facility and the 2500 million 4375 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 











the indenture for our 250 million 4375 senior notes due in 2023 and our 2013 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the 2013 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2013 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2013 and 2014 we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of 5222 million although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 20 countries in 2014 about 50 of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec performance system and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity freight rail markets around the world are driven primarily by overall economic conditions and activity while transit markets are driven primarly by government funding and passenger ridership changes in these market drivers can cause fluctuations in demand for wabtec’s product and services unife projects growth of about 27 in the worldwide rail supply market over the next several years with the highest expected growth rates in africa the middle east and latin america

in north america the aar compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry including revenue tonmiles and carloadings which are generally referred to as “rail traffic” based on changes in rail traffic trends railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars in 2014 north american carloadings increased 44 including a 54 increase in intermodal carloadings while deliveries of new locomotives and new freight cars increased 15 and 27 respectively in 2015 we expect demand for new locomotives to be slightly lower than in 2014 while we expect demand for new freight cars to be higher unife projects a growth rate of about 30 in north america 

in north america the american public transportation association apta compiles ridership statistics and trends based on preliminary figures for 2014 ridership increased about 09 in the us and about 14 in canada ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities which use these funds along with state and local money primarily for equipment maintenance in 2014 the us congress passed a budget that is expected to increase spending on transit projects to 11 billion in 2015 an increase of about 2 from 2014 levels a majority of federal money is used by transit agencies to purchase new equipment or infrastructure

wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the us particularly in europe asiapacific and south america to gauge activity in these markets we monitor trends in rail traffic and the spending plans of our customers in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is larger than the transit market in the us our presence in the uk germany and italy has positioned the company to take advantage of this market unife projects the western european rail market to grow at about 20 in the next few years with the united kingdom and france expected to invest in new rolling stock unife projects the market in asiapacific the world’s second largest according to the study to grow by 40 over the next several years primarily reflecting strong spending in china in recent years other growth markets around the world according to unife include latin america expected to grow at about 50 and the commonwealth of independent states expected to grow at about 10 through wholly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures wabtec has a presence in every key freight rail and passenger transit market around the world

in 2015 and beyond general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally will have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

critical accounting estimates

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves pensions and other postretirement benefits stock based compensation and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 18 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

inventories

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring the cost of additional reserves to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations for example based on the last quantitative analysis performed as of october 1 2013 a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by 1752 million or an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by 4829 million even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values necessitating no step 2 calculations see note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

warranty reserves

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses 

accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits

description the company provides pension and postretirement benefits for its employees these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for example a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense 29 million or decrease expense 23 million respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation 510 million or decrease the obligation 411 million respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense 22 million respectively if the actual asset values at december 31 2014 had been 1 lower the amortization of losses in the following year would decrease 01 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would decrease or increase expense 04 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would decrease the obligation 46 million or increase the obligation 54 million respectively 

stockbased compensation

description the company has issued incentive stock awards to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new threeyear performance cycle with the most recently commenced cycle being 20122014 no incentive stock awards will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock awards vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts in the initial grant year of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period for example a 10 decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stockbased compensation expense by approximately 08 million and 08 million respectively 

income taxes

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

revenue recognition

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc605 “revenue recognition” the company recognizes revenues on longterm contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting the unitsofdelivery method or other inputbased or outputbased measures as appropriate are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined certain preproduction costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts 

judgments and uncertainties revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers title has passed and the price for the product has been determined contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages for each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method the amount reported as revenues is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period due to the size duration and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends business base and other economic projections factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements for longterm contracts revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined preproduction costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company’s progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2014 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1 it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately 83 million a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of preproduction costs could be realized if the company’s estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled

interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variablerate debt the company’s variable rate debt represents 23 and 11 of total longterm debt at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively on an annual basis a 1 change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31 2014 would increase or decrease interest expense by about 12 million 

to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixedrate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts refer to “financial derivatives and hedging activities” in note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk

general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars subway cars and buses and on many of these vehicles around the world in 2013 the company had sales of approximately 26 billion and net income of about 2922 million in 2013 sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 57 of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 48 of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions traffi c volumes as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems 

according to a recent study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 100 billion and it is expected to grow at about 27 annually through 2017 the three largest markets which represent about 75 of the total market are europe asiapacific and north america unife projects the overall market to remain stable through 2020 as emerging markets show aboveaverage growth due to increasing global trade and freight volumes urbanization and growth in public mass transport systems and increasing environmental awareness while developed markets grow at a slower pace 

by using various industry publications and market studies we estimate that the global installed base of locomotives is about 110000 units with about 35 in asiapacific about 25 in russiacis and about 20 in nafta we estimate the global installed base of freight cars is about 52 million units with about 30 each in russiacis and nafta and about 20 in asiapacific we estimate the global installed base o f transit cars is about 330000 units with about 55 in asiapacific about 20 in europe and about 10 in russia 

in north america railroads carry about 40  of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods including coal metals minerals chemicals grain and petroleum these commodities represent about 55 of total rail carloadings with intermodal carloads accounting for the rest intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including rail traffic and production of new locomotives and new freight cars in 2013 



 





in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles the new york city region is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit servi ces 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including government funding deliveries of new subway cars and buses and ridership 

the us federal government provides money to local transit authorities primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems in 2012 the us congress passed a new twoyear funding bill which maintained spending at the same level about 107 billion as in prior years the number of new transit cars delivered in 2013 was about 1000 compared to about 600 in 2012 the number of new buses delivered in 2013 was about 4400 compared to about the same in 2012 in the past 10 years the average number of new transit cars delivered annually is about 800 and the average number of new buses delivered annually is about 4700 

ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities which use these funds along with state and local money primarily for equipment and system maintenance based on preliminary figures from the american public transportation association ridership on us transit vehicles increased slightly about 02 in 2013 after a 25 increase in 2012 

outside of north america  many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia brazil india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world some governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies according to unife emerging markets are expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit france germany the united kingdom and italy are the largest transit markets representing about twothirds of passenger traffic in the european union unife projects the western european rail market to grow at about 2 in the next few years with the united kingdom and france expected to invest in new rolling stock according to the uk’s office of rail regulation passenger rail usage has steadily increased in the past decade with the office reporting a 39 increase in second quarter ridership in its most recent quarterly report for the same time period the office also reported an increase of 89 in freight volume driven by a strong increase in coal shipments germany has the largest rail network in europe in its most recent report the federal statistical office of germany reported an increase in passenger traffic of 08 in 2013 about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in the first nine months of 2013 the federal statistical office of germany reported a 11 decrease in freight volumes compared to the same period in 2012 for 2013 sncf french national railway reported decreases of about 15 in local and regional passenger rail traffic and about 30 in freightrelated revenue we estimate that the european rail market consists of about 11000 locomotives about 750000 freight cars and about 72000 passenger transit cars 

the asiapacific market is now the secondlargest geographic segment according to unife this market consists primarily of china india and australia growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries as well as in australia we estimate that this market consists of about 35000 locomotives and about 10 million freight cars china is expected to increase spending on rail infrastructure and equipment in 2014 as it resumes investment in highspeed rail programs the australian railway association in a september 2013 study reported an increase of freight volume of 8 and an increase of passenger ridership of 2 in its most recent report the indian government reported that in the first nine months of its fiscal 2013 freight rail traffic increased about 50 and passenger rail traffic decreased about 05 india is expected to increase spending significantly in 2014 as it seeks to modernize its rail system 

other key geographic markets include russiacis south africa and brazil with about 15 million freight cars and about 28000 locomotives russiacis is among the largest freight rail markets in the world and it’s expected to invest significantly in new rolling stock and infrastructure russian railways a stateowned company provides both freight and passenger transportation in 2012 the most recent full year of reported data freight traffic increased 29 and passenger traffic increased 34 south africa in 

 

2012 announced a major program to invest in its freight rail and passenger transit infrastructure during the next 20 years as part of this program prasa the passenger rail agency of south africa plans to purchase about 3600 new transit cars and about 1000 new locomotives in brazil mrs logistica one of the country’s largest railroads reported a 56 increase in freight carloadings in its most recent quarter the country has also been investing in its passenger transport systems in advances of hosting the 2014 world cup and the 2016 olympics 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight segment and the transit segment both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers 

the freight segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotive and freight cars  supplies railway electronics positive train control equipment signal design and engineering services builds switcher locomotives rebuilds freight locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars and utilities as discussed previously demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2013 the freight segment accounted for 54 of our total sales with about 55 of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers in 2013 slightly more than half of the freight segment’s sales were in aftermarket 

the transit segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world as discussed previously demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership in 2013 the transit segment accounted for 46 of our total sales with about 48 of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers about twothirds of the transit segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market 

following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments 

specialty products  electronics 

















brake products 





remanufacturing overhaul and build 





transit products 







 

we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments supported by our technical staff of over 1100 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers 

over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of positive train control “ptc” technology which includes onboard locomotive computer and related software on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us with our electronic train management system ®  we are the leading supplier of this onboard train control equipment and we are working with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology by the december 31 2015 deadline set in the rail safety bill in recent years the railroads and transit authorities have stated they cannot achieve full implementation of ptc by the deadline and various bills have been introduced to extend it but to date there has been no change in the deadline 

in 2013  wabtec recorded about 235 million of revenue from implementation of ptc projects both foreign and domestic these multiyear projects include a 165 million contract to design and install a train control system for mrs logistica the fourthlargest railroad in brazil a 63 million contract to provide train control equipment and services for denver transit partners for three new commuter rail lines and a 27 million contract to provide train control equipment for metrolink a commuter rail agency in los angeles

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 









 



business strategy 

using wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 









recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

wabtec has completed certain significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above 



• on september 24 2013 the company acquired longwood industries inc “longwood” a manufacturer of specialty rubber products for transportation oil and gas and industrial markets for a net purchase price of approximately 839 million net of cash 

 















backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 169 billion at december 31 2013 for 2013 about 57 of total sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 201 3 and december 31 2012 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

 



engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013  2012 and 2011 we invested about 463 million 413 million and 372 million respectively on product development and improvement activities the engineering resources of the company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts 

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durabilit y we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have more than 2150 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan  nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe asia south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses and lessors of such equipment 

in 2013  about 48 of sales were to customers outside the us and to more than 100 countries throughout the world about 57 of sales were in the aftermarket with a majority of our remaining sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2013  our top five customers accounted for 15 of net sales the massachusetts bay transportation authority general electric transportation csx corporation trinity industries and union pacific corporation no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel a division of caterpillar ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america no individual company is our principal competitor in all of our operating locations the largest competitors for brake and transit products are faiveley transport and knorr 

 

employees 

at december 31 2013  we had 10234 fulltime employees approximately 27 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements are generally effective from 2014 through 2016 agreements expiring at various times during 2014 cover approximately 15 of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes as a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended decembe r 31 2013 our top five customers accounted for 15 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 









we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ptc mandate from the us federal government which requires the use of onboard locomotive computers and software by december 31 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2013  we had sales of about 235 million related to ptc in recent years the railroads and transit authorities have stated they cannot achieve full implementation of ptc by the deadline and various bills have been introduced to extend it but to date there has been no change in the deadline should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing scope or requirements of the safety bill there could be an adverse impact on our revenues in future periods and would cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in frei ght traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a 

 

substantial portion of our net sales have been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

our backlog is not necessarily indicative of the level of our future revenues 

our backlog represents future production and estimated potential revenue attributable to firm contracts with or written orders from our customers for delivery in various periods instability in the global economy negative conditions in the global credit markets volatility in the industries that our products serve changes in legislative policy adverse changes in the financial condition of ou r customers adverse changes in the availability of raw materials and supplies or unremedied contract breaches could possibly lead to contract termination or cancellations of orders in our backlog or request for deferred deliveries of our backlog orders each of which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 201 3 approximately 48 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 















in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united state s by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with most other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislatio n on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 27 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2014 through 2016 agreements expiring at various times during 2014 cover approximately 15 of the company’s workforce failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2013  we had total debt of 4507 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2013 refinancing credit agreement the 2000 million currently borrowed under this facility and the 2500 million 4375 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 





 







the indenture for our 250 million 4375 senior notes due in 2023 and our 2013 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the 2013 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2013 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the inc urrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2012 and 2013 we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of 3719 million although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 19 countries in 2013 about 48 of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec performance system and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity the north america freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic based on those fluctuations railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars the aar compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry including revenue tonmiles and carloadings which are generally referred to as “rail traffic” in 2013 north american carloadings increased 21 including a 44 increase in intermodal carloadings in 2014 we expect demand for new locomotives to be about the same as in 2013 while we expect demand for new freight cars to be slightly higher future demand depends largely on the strength in the overall economy and in rail traffic volumes 

in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of ptc technology which includes onboard locomotive computer and related software on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us with our electronic train management system ®  we are the leading supplier of this onboard train control equipment and we are working with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology by the december 31 2015 deadline set in the rail safety bill in recent years the railroads and transit authorities have stated they cannot achieve full implementation of ptc by the deadline and various bills have been introduced to extend it but to date there has been no change in the deadline an extension of the deadline could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology wabtec’s ptc revenue was about 235 million in 2013 

the north american transit rail industry is driven by government spending and ridership in 201 2 the us congress passed a new twoyear funding bill which maintained spending at about the same level about 107 billion as in prior years ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities which use these funds along with state and local money primarily for equipment and system maintenance based on preliminary figures from the american public transportation association ridership on us transit vehicles increased slightly about 02 in 2013 after a 25 increase in 2012 spending in 2014 is expected to remain at about current levels 

wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the us  particularly in europe asiapacific and south america to gauge activity in these markets we monitor trends in rail traffic and the spending plans of our customers in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is larger than the transit market in the us our presence in the uk germany and italy has positioned the company to take advantage of this market unife projects the western european rail market to grow at about 2 in the next few years with the united kingdom and france expected to invest in new rolling stock asiapacific is a growth market and our various joint ventures and direct exports to china have positioned the company to take advantage of this growth growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of countries such as china and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries as well as in australia china is expected to increase spending on rail infrastructure and equipment in 2014 as it resumes investment in highspeed rail programs economic growth in australia has been an area of expansion for the company as commodity suppliers use our products to meet the demands of their regional customers the company is delivering on a ptc contract expanding locations and has completed two acquisitions in brazil allowing us to increase our sales in that market 

in 2014 and beyond general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy 

 

including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

results of operations 

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 

  



2013 compared to 2012 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

  



the following table shows the major components of the change in sales in 2013 from 2012 

  



net sales increased by  1753 million to 25664 million in 2013 from 23911 million in 2012 the increase is due to sales related to acquisitions of 1579 million higher brake products sales of 355 million due to higher demand for transit original equipment brakes higher remanufacturing overhaul and build sales of 748 million from increased demand for transit original 

 

equipment locomotives and aftermarket services for locomotives and an increase in other transit products of 59 million these increases were partially offset by a 849 million decrease for specialty products and electronics sales from lower demand for freight original equipment rail products lower demand heat exchange products partially offset by an increased demand for positive train control products company net sales decreased 156 million and income from operations decreased 07 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange net income for 2013 was 2922 million or 301 per diluted share net income increased due to higher sales volume

critical accounting estimates 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the ac counting for allowance for doubtful accounts inventories the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment warranty reserves pensions and other postretirement benefits stock based compensation and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 18 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report and is incorporated by reference herein management believes that the application of the se policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

 

accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 

description the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated losses on uncollectible accounts receivable 

 

judgments and uncertainties   the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions   if our estimates regarding the collectability of troubled accounts andor our actual losses within our receivable portfolio exceed our historical experience we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our allowance for doubtful accounts 

 

inventories 

description inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and are reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories 

 

judgments and uncertainties cost is determined under the firstin firstout fifo method inventory costs include material labor and overhead the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog and anticipated future requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if the market value of our products were to decrease due to changing market conditions the company could be at risk of incurring the cost of additional reserves to adjust inventory value to a market value lower than stated cost if our estimates regarding sales and backlog requirements are inaccurate we may be exposed to the expense of increasing our reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventory 

 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles 

 

description goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the company performs its annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and more frequently when indicators of impairment are present the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill 

 

judgments and uncertainties a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the impairment test including the identification of macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors overall financial performance wabtec specific events and share price trends and making the assessment on whether each relevant factor will impact the impairment test positively or negatively and the magnitude of any such amount 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its reporting units are estimated however actual amounts realized may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations for example based on the last quantitative analysis performed as of october 1 2013 a decline in the terminal growth rate greater than 50 basis points would decrease fair market value by 1752 million or an increase in the weightedaverage cost of capital by 100 basis points would result in a decrease in fair market value by 4829 million even with such changes the fair value of the reporting units would be greater than their net book values as of the valuation date of october 1 2013 necessitating no step 2 calculations see note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional discussion regarding impairment testing 

 

warranty reserves 

 

description the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods 

 

judgments and uncertainties in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability the company may be at risk of realizing material gains or losses 

 

accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits 

 

description these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality 

 

 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets the differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in expense using the normal amortization of gains and losses per asc 715 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the pension and other postretirement benefits change significantly these costs can fluctuate materially from period to period the key assumptions in determining the pension and other postretirement expense and obligation include the discount rate expected return on assets and health care cost trend rate for example a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement expense would increase expense 37 million or decrease expense 19 million respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the discount rate used in determining the pension and postretirement obligation would increase the obligation 380 million or decrease the obligation 300 million respectively a 1 decrease or increase in the expected return on assets used in determining the pension expense would increase or decrease expense 20 million respectively if the actual asset values at december 31 2012 had been 1 lower the amortization of losses in the following year would increase 02 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement expense would decrease or increase expense 04 million a 1 decrease or increase in the health care cost trend rate used in determining the postretirement obligation would decrease the obligation 31 million or increase the obligation 36 million respectively

description the company has issued incentive stock awards to eligible employees that vest upon attainment of certain cumulative threeyear performance goals the program is structured as a rolling threeyear plan each year starts a new threeyear performance cycle with the most recently commenced cycle being 20122014 no incentive stock awards will vest for performance below the threeyear cumulative threshold the company utilizes an economic profit measure for this performance goal economic profit is a measure of the extent to which the company produces financial results in excess of its cost of capital based on the company’s achievement of the threshold and threeyear cumulative performance the stock awards vested can range from 0 to 200 of the shares granted 

 

judgments and uncertainties significant judgments and estimates are used in determining the estimated threeyear performance which is then used to estimate the total shares expected to vest over the three year vesting cycle and corresponding expense based on the grant date fair value of the award when determining the estimated threeyear performance the company utilizes a combination of historical actual results budgeted results and forecasts in the initial grant year of a performance cycle the company estimates the threeyear performance at 100 as actual performance results for a cycle begin to accumulate and the company completes its budgeting and forecasting cycles the performance estimates are updated these judgments and estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions if assumptions used in determining the estimated threeyear performance change significantly stockbased compensation expense related to the unvested incentive stock awards can fluctuate materially from period to period for example a 10 decrease or increase in the estimated vesting percentage for incentive stock awards would decrease or increase stockbased compensation expense by approximately 08 million and 08 million respectively 

 

income taxes 

 

description wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates in accordance with asc 74010 accounting for income taxes and accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

 

judgments and uncertainties the estimate of our tax obligations are uncertain because management must use judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions as well as realization of our deferred tax assets asc 74010 establishes a recognition and measurement threshold to determine the amount of tax benefit that should be recognized related to uncertain tax positions 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount a deferred tax valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

 

 

revenue recognition 

 

description revenue is recognized in accordance with asc605 “revenue recognition” the company recognizes revenues on longterm contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting the unitsofdelivery method or other inputbased or outputbased measures as appropriate are used to measure the progress toward completion of individual contracts contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined certain preproduction costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be recognized over the life of the contracts 

 

judgments and uncertainties revenue is recognized when products have been shipped to the respective customers title has passed and the price for the product has been determined contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract which results in the development of estimated profit margin percentages for each contract with revenue recognized using the percentage of completion method the amount reported as revenues is determined by calculating cost incurred to date as a percentage of the total expected contract costs to determine the percentage of total contract revenue to be recognized in the current period due to the size duration and nature of many of our contracts the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities modified by our assumptions regarding contract options change orders and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or indexbased clauses total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms historical performance trends business base and other economic projections factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends technical and schedule risk internal and subcontractor performance trends business volume assumptions asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements for longterm contracts revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised quarterly at a minimum and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as such amounts are determined preproduction costs are recognized over the expected life of the contract usually based on the company’s progress toward the estimated number of units expected to be delivered under the production or supply contract 

 

effect if actual results differ from assumptions should market conditions and customer demands dictate changes to our standard shipping terms the company may be impacted by longer than typical revenue recognition cycles the development of expected contract costs and contract profit margin percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process it is likely that materially different revenue amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change changes in underlying assumptionsestimates supplier performance or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods if the combined profit margin for all contracts recognized on the percentage of completion method during 2013 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1 it would have increased or decreased revenue and gross profit for the year by approximately 83 million a few of our contracts are expected to be completed in a loss position provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts a charge to expense for unrecognized portions of preproduction costs could be realized if the company’s estimate of the number of units to be delivered changes or the underlying contract is cancelled

interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variablerate debt the company’s variable rate debt represents 11 and 53 of total longterm debt at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively on an annual basis a 1 change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31 2013 would increase or decrease interest expense by about 05 million 

to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixedrate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts refer to “financial derivatives and hedging activities” in note 2 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for additional information regarding interest rate risk

 item 1 business tableend general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars subway cars and buses in 2012 the company had sales of approximately 24 billion and net income of about 2517 million in 2012 sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 54 of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 50 of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems 

according to a recent study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 1000 billion and it is expected to grow at 225 annually through 2016 the three largest markets which represent about 75 of the total market are europe asiapacific and north america 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods coal is the singlelargest item representing about 40 of carloadings in 2012 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including 

 

   

  

  

 in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles the new york city region is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

 outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia brazil india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world some governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies according to unife emerging markets are expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit france germany the united kingdom and italy are the largest transit markets representing about twothirds of passenger traffic in the european union in its most recent financial report deutsche bahn german national railway reported an increase in passenger traffic of 40 for the first six months of 2012 about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom in the first half of 2012 deutsche bahn reported a 26 decrease in freightrelated revenues compared to the same period in 2011 according to unife the european rail market consists of about 33000 locomotives about 700000 freight cars and about 150000 passenger transit cars in recent years the european market purchased on average about 1300 new locomotives about 1000 new freight cars and about 8500 new passenger transit cars annually 

  

the asiapacific market is now the secondlargest geographic segment according to a recent unife study this market consists primarily of china india and australia growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries as well as in australia according to unife this market consists of about 34000 locomotives and about 10 million freight cars china is expected to increase spending on rail infrastructure and equipment in 2013 the indian government reported that in the first nine months of its fiscal 2012 freight rail traffic increased about 4 and passenger rail traffic increased about 3 india is expected to increase spending significantly in 2013 as it seeks to modernize its rail system 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight segment and the transit segment both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers 

the freight segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotive and freight cars  supplies railway electronics positive train control equipment signal design and engineering services builds switcher locomotives rebuilds freight locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars and utilities as discussed previously demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2012 the freight segment accounted for 63 of our total sales with about 70 of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers in 2012 slightly less than half of the freight segment’s sales were in aftermarket 

the transit segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world as discussed previously demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership in 2012 the transit segment accounted for 37 of our total sales with about 54 of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers about twothirds of the transit segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market 

following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments

 transit products 

 

  

  

 we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments supported by our technical staff of over 1120 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers 

over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of positive train control “ptc” technology which includes onboard locomotive computer and related software on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us with our electronic train management system ®  we are the leading supplier of this onboard train control equipment and we are working with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology by the december 31 2015 deadline set in the rail safety bill as part of its new surface transportation funding bill a house committee has proposed extending this deadline 

in 2012 wabtec recorded about 215 million of revenue from implementation of ptc projects both foreign and domestic these multiyear projects include a 165 million contract to design and install a train control system for mrs logistica the fourthlargest railroad in brazil a 63 million contract to provide train control equipment and services for denver transit partners for three new commuter rail lines and a 27 million contract to provide train control equipment for metrolink a commuter rail agency in los angeles

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 business strategy 

using wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time 

  

these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 

  

  

  

 recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

wabtec has completed certain significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 166 billion at december 31 2012 for 2012 about 54 of total sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2012 and december 31 2011 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

 

 engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we invested about 413 million 372 million and 402 million respectively on product development and improvement activities the engineering resources of the company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts 

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its 

  

reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have more than 1475 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe asia south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses and lessors of such equipment 

in 2012 about 50 of sales were to customers outside the us and to more than 100 countries throughout the world about 54 of sales were in the aftermarket with a majority of our remaining sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 our top five customers accounted for 16 of net sales general electric transportation mrs logistica sa national steel car limited trinity industries and the greenbrier companies no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

  

our principal competitors vary across product lines within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag “knorr” and amsted rail company inc a subsidiary of amsted industries corporation are our principal overall oem competitors our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america no individual company is our principal competitor in all our operating locations largest competitors for brake and transit products are faiveley transport and knorr 

employees 

at december 31 2012 we had 9253 fulltime employees approximately 27 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements are generally effective from 2013 through 2015 agreements expiring at various times during 2013 cover approximately 16 of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes as a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period 

environmental matters 

information on environmental matters is included in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012 our top five customers accounted for 16 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

  

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ptc mandate from the us federal government which requires the use of onboard locomotive computers and software by december 31 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we had sales of about 215 million related to ptc as part of its new surface transportation funding bill a house committee has proposed extending the ptc deadline which could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing scope or requirements of the safety bill there could be an adverse impact on our revenues in future periods and would cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales have been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2012 approximately 50 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia mexico the netherlands poland spain south africa turkey and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with most other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are 

  

more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have a history of warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 27 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2013 through 2015 agreements expiring at various times during 2013 cover approximately 16 of the company’s workforce failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2012 we had total debt of 3179 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement the 1670 million currently borrowed under this facility and the 1500 million 6875 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the indenture for our 150 million 6875 senior notes due in 2013 and our 2011 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the 2011 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2011 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2011 and 2012 we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of 2588 million although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained or the timing of such improvements the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 19 countries in 2012 about 50 of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec performance system and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity the north america freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic based on those fluctuations railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars the aar compiles statistics that gauge the level of activity in the freight rail industry including revenue tonmiles and carloadings which are generally referred to as “rail traffic” in 2012 us revenue tonmiles decreased 24 carloadings decreased 31 and intermodal carloadings increased 32 generally reflecting a sluggish economy and reduced coal traffic in anticipation of increased future demand railroads increased their purchases of new locomotives and freight cars which had a favorable effect on the company’s freight segment in 2013 we expect demand for new locomotives to remain about the same as in 2012 while we expect demand for new freight cars to be slightly lower future demand depends largely on the strength in the overall economy and in rail traffic volumes 

in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of ptc technology which includes onboard locomotive computer and related software on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us with our electronic train management system ®  we are the leading supplier of this onboard train control equipment and we are working with the us class i railroads commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology by the december 31 2015 deadline set in the rail safety bill as part of its new surface transportation funding bill a house committee has proposed extending this deadline an extension of the deadline could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology ptc revenue was about 215 million in 2012 

the north american transit rail industry is driven by government spending and ridership in 2012 the us congress passed a new twoyear funding bill which maintained spending at about the same level about 107 billion as in prior years ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities which use these funds along with state and local money primarily for equipment and system maintenance based on preliminary figures from the american public transportation association ridership on us transit vehicles increased about 25 in 2012 after a 2 increase in 2011 spending in 2013 is expected to remain at about current levels 

in 2012 market conditions were mixed in the north america freight rail market demand for new freight cars and locomotives were higher but revenue tonmiles and carloadings were lower in 2012 us revenue tonmiles decreased 24 carloadings decreased 31 and intermodal carloadings increased 32 generally reflecting a sluggish economy and reduced coal traffic in the passenger transit market during 2012 the company believes that existing levels of federal funding and ridership resulted in consistent demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts when compared to previous years however most government entities at all levels are facing budget issues which could have a negative effect on demand for the company’s products and services 

  

wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the us particularly in europe asiapacific and south america in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is larger than the transit market in the us our presence in the uk germany and italy has positioned the company to take advantage of this market asiapacific is a growth market and our various joint ventures and direct exports to china have positioned the company to take advantage of this growth economic growth in australia has been an area of expansion for the company as commodity suppliers use our products to meet the demands of their regional customers the company is delivering on a ptc contract expanding locations and has completed two acquisitions in brazil allowing us to increase our sales in that market 

in 2013 and beyond general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks

2011 refinancing credit agreement 

on november 7 2011 the company refinanced its existing revolving credit and term loan facility with a consortium of commercial banks this “2011 refinancing credit agreement” provides the company with a 600 million fiveyear revolving credit facility the company incurred approximately 19 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2011 refinancing credit agreement the facility expires on november 7 2016 the 2011 refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below at december 31 2012 the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of 325 million of letters of credit of approximately 4005 million subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 

under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement the company may elect a base rate of interest or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” of interest “the alternate rate” the base rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the pnc na prime rate or the daily libor rate plus 100 basis points plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 75 basis points the alternate rate is based on quoted libor rates plus a margin that ranges from 75 to 175 basis points both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the initial base rate margin is 25 basis points and the alternate rate margin is 125 basis points 

at december 31 2012 the weighted average interest rate on the company’s variable rate debt was 121 on january 12 2012 the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional 

  

value of 150 million the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is july 31 2013 and the termination date is november 7 2016 the impact of the interest rate swap agreement will be to convert a portion of the company’s then outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixedrate borrowing during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 1415 plus the alternate rate margin the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible 

the 2011 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2011 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 30 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325 the company does not expect that these measurements will limit the company in executing our operating activities see note 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

2008 refinancing credit agreement 

on november 4 2008 the company refinanced its then existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “2008 refinancing credit agreement” provided the company with a 300 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and a 200 million fiveyear term loan facility the company incurred 29 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2008 refinancing credit agreement both facilities were set to expire in january 2013 

under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement the company may have elected a base rate of interest or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” of interest “the alternate rate” the base rate adjusted on a daily basis and is the greater of the pnc na prime rate 30day libor plus 150 basis points or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points the alternate rate was based on quoted libor rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios 

6875 senior notes due august 2013 in august 2003 the company issued 1500 million of senior notes due in 2013 “the notes” the notes were issued at par interest on the notes accrues at a rate of 6875 per annum and is payable semiannually on january 31 and july 31 of each year the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company’s existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes the principal balance is due in full at maturity the company has both the intent and ability to refinance the notes maturing august 2013 on a long term basis utilizing capacity under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement the 2011 refinancing credit agreement will provide available bank borrowing capacity sufficient to refinance the notes on a longterm basis the notes are included in the longterm portion of debt as of december 31 2012 the company is in compliance with the restrictions and covenants in the indenture under which the notes were issued and expects that these restrictions and covenants will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities for additional information regarding the notes see note 6 of the “notes to condensed consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available may be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements

 item 1 business tableend general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars subway cars and buses in 2011 the company had sales of almost 2 billion and net income of about 170 million in 2011 sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 57 of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 47 of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems 

according to a recent study by unife the association of the european rail industry the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than 1000 billion and it is expected to grow at 225 annually through 2016 the three largest markets which represent about 80 of the total market are europe asiapacific and north america 

in north america railroads carry about 43 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods coal is the singlelargest item representing about 45 of carloadings in 2011 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including 

 

   

  

  

 in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles the new york city region is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

 outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia brazil india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world some governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies according to unife emerging markets are expected to grow at aboveaverage rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient masstransportation systems as this growth occurs wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit france germany the united kingdom and italy are the largest transit markets representing about twothirds of passenger traffic in the european union in their most recent financial reports sncf french national railway and deutsche bahn german national railway reported increases in passenger traffic of 38 for the first nine months of 2011 and 13 for the first six months of 2011 respectively about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland 

  

and the united kingdom in the first half of 2011 deutsche bahn reported an 8 increase in freightrelated revenues compared to the same period in 2010 according to unife the european rail market consists of about 33000 locomotives about 700000 freight cars and about 150000 passenger transit cars in recent years the european market purchased on average about 1300 new locomotives about 1000 new freight cars and about 8500 new passenger transit cars annually 

the asiapacific market is now the secondlargest geographic segment according to a recent unife study this market consists primarily of china india and australia growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of china and india and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries as well as in australia according to unife this market consists of about 34000 locomotives and about 1 million freight cars wabtec estimates that rail equipment spending in china decreased in 2011 as the government continued to invest in expansion of its freight and passenger rail network but curtailed investments in highspeed rail due to a crash in july 2011 the indian government forecasted that in 2011 freight rail traffic increased about 12 and passenger rail traffic increased about 5 india is expected to increase spending significantly in 2012 as it seeks to modernize its rail system 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight group and the transit group both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers

the transit group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world as discussed previously demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership in 2011 the transit group accounted for 39 of our total sales with about half of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers about twothirds of the transit group’s sales are in the aftermarket and the remainder in the original equipment market

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

  

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have more than 1250 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe asia south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses and lessors of such equipment 

in 2011 about 47 of sales were to customers outside the us and to more than 100 countries throughout the world about 57 of sales were in the aftermarket with a majority of our remaining sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 our top five customers accounted for 17 of net sales general electric transportation eversholt formally hsbc rail uk ltd csx transportation electro motive or cat and union pacific no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and 

  

passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace outside of north america no individual company is our principal competitor in all our operating locations largest competitors for brake and transit products are faiveley transport and knorrbremse 

employees 

at december 31 2011 we had 8648 fulltime employees approximately 25 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements are generally effective from 2012 through 2014 agreements expiring at various times during 2012 cover approximately 17 of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes as a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period

 item 1a risk factors tableend prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2011 our top five customers accounted for 17 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious customers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition including 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

  

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

a portion of our sales are related to delivering products and services to help our us railroad and transit customers meet the positive train control ptc mandate from the us federal government which requires the use of onboard locomotive computers and software by december 31 2015 

for the year ended december 31 2011 we had sales of about 125 million related to ptc as part of its new surface transportation funding bill a house committee has proposed extending the ptc deadline to december 31 2020 which could affect the rate of industry spending on this technology should the federal government change its mandate by amending the timing scope or requirements of the safety bill there could be an adverse impact on our revenues in future periods and would cause us to reassess the staffing resources and assets deployed in delivering positive train control services 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales have been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2011 approximately 47 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia austria brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia malaysia mexico poland spain south africa and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

it is management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestosrelated bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors including 1 the asbestos case settlement history of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary rfpc 2 the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general and 3 the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular despite this uncertainty and although the results of the company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestosrelated lawsuits management believes that the final resolution of the company’s asbestosrelated cases will not be material to the company’s overall financial position results of operations and cash flows in general this belief is based upon 1 wabtec’s and rfpc’s history of settlements and dismissals of asbestosrelated cases to date 2 the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc’s product and 3 the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss 

more specifically as to rfpc management’s belief that any losses due to asbestosrelated cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims to date rfpc’s insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions the overall number of new claims being filed against rfpc has dropped significantly in recent years however these new claims and all previously filed claims may take a significant period of time to resolve as to wabtec and its divisions management’s belief that asbestosrelated cases will not have a material impact is also based on 

  

its position that it has no legal liability for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims and that the former owners of wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue to date wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion all of which confirmed wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions these costs have not been material and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 25 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2012 through 2014 agreements expiring at various times during 2012 cover approximately 17 of the company’s workforce failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills 

  

to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2011 we had total debt of 3959 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement along with carrying the 2450 million currently borrowed under this facility and the 1500 million 6875 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 the indenture for our 150 million 6875 senior notes due in 2013 and our 2011 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the 2011 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2011 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2010 and 2011 we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of 2358 million although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results 

  

including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 18 countries in 2011 about 47 of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and implementation of the wabtec performance system and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s current operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity the north america freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic based on those fluctuations railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars in 2011 us freight rail traffic increased due to the improving overall economy according to the association of american railroads in 2011 revenue tonmiles increased 32 carloadings increased 22 and intermodal loadings increased 54 compared to the same period of 2010 as rail traffic rebounded from the 200809 economic recession this has had a favorable effect on the company’s freight group with increased demand for new locomotives and freight cars and for aftermarket products and services about 15 of the company’s revenues are directly related to deliveries of new freight cars so the improvement in that market has had a favorable effect on the company’s financial results whether demand continues to improve will depend largely on continued strength in the overall economy and in rail traffic volumes 

in 2008 the us government enacted rail safety legislation that requires certain freight and passenger railroads to equip certain locomotives with positive train control “ptc” technology by the end of 2015 this technology includes an onboard locomotive computer and related software which are being developed by wabtec as the industry leader wabtec expects to benefit from increased sales of train controlrelated products and engineering services as the technology is deployed throughout the industry ptc revenue was about 125 million in 2011 

the north american transit rail industry is driven by government spending and ridership according to the american public transportation association spending under safetealu the federal government’s transportation funding bill increased about 6 in 2009 and remained consistent in 2010 and 2011 while ridership decreased about 4 and 1 in 2009 and 2010 respectively due to the recession and its impact on employment levels ridership increased about 2 in 2011 although safetealu expired in september 2009 the bill has been extended through march 2012 with funding at about 2009 levels spending in 2012 is expected to remain at about current levels and congress is now considering various multiyear funding bills 

in 2011 market conditions improved in the north america freight rail market demand for new freight cars and locomotives was higher due to increasing freight rail traffic in the passenger transit market during 2011 the company believes that existing levels of federal funding and ridership resulted in consistent demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts when compared to previous years however most government entities at all levels are facing budget issues which could have a negative effect on demand for the company’s products and services 

  

wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the us particularly in europe asiapacific and south america in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is larger than the transit market in the us our presence in the uk germany and italy has positioned the company to take advantage of this market asiapacific is a growth market and our various joint ventures and direct exports to china have positioned the company to take advantage of this growth economic growth in australia has been an area of expansion for the company as commodity suppliers use our products to meet the demands of their regional customers recently the company has announced a contract and an acquisition in brazil allowing us to expand our presence in that market 

in 2012 and beyond general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have an impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy including the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

results of operations 

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 

 

 2011 compared to 2010 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period

under the 2011 refinancing credit agreement the company may elect a base rate of interest or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” of interest “the alternate rate” the base rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the pnc na prime rate or the daily libor rate plus 100 basis points plus a margin that ranges from 0 to 75 basis points the alternate rate is based on quoted libor rates plus a margin that ranges from 75 to 175 basis points both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the initial base rate margin is 25 basis points and the alternate rate margin is 125 basis points 

at december 31 2011 the weighted average interest rate on the company’s variable rate debt was 153 to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert a portion of the debt from a variable to a fixedrate borrowing during the term of the swap contracts on december 31 2011 the notional value of the interest rate swaps outstanding was 1070 million and effectively changed the company’s interest rate on bank debt at december 31 2011 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 219 the interest rate swap agreements mature on december 31 2012 the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible 

on january 12 2012 the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of 150 million the effective date of the interest rate swap agreement is july 31 2013 and the 

  

termination date is november 7 2016 the impact of the interest rate swap agreement will be to convert a portion of the company’s then outstanding debt from a variable rate to a fixedrate borrowing during the term of the interest rate swap agreement the interest rate on the notional value will be fixed at 1415 the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible 

the 2011 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2011 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 30 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325 the company does not expect that these measurements will limit the company in executing our operating activities see note 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

2008 refinancing credit agreement 

on november 4 2008 the company refinanced its then existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “2008 refinancing credit agreement” provided the company with a 300 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and a 200 million fiveyear term loan facility the company incurred 29 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2008 refinancing credit agreement both facilities were set to expire in january 2013 

under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement the company may have elected a base rate of interest or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” of interest “the alternate rate” the base rate adjusted on a daily basis and is the greater of the pnc na prime rate 30day libor plus 150 basis points or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points the alternate rate was based on quoted libor rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios 

6875 senior notes due august 2013 in august 2003 the company issued 150 million of senior notes due in 2013 “the notes” the notes were issued at par interest on the notes accrues at a rate of 6875 per annum and is payable semiannually on january 31 and july 31 of each year the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company’s existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes the principal balance is due in full at maturity 

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities 

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements

in north america railroads carry about 43 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods coal is the singlelargest item representing about 45 of carloadings in 2010 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including 

 

   

  

  

 in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles the new york city region is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

 outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world some governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies these investment programs represent opportunities for wabtec to provide products and services 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit france germany the united kingdom and italy are the largest transit markets representing about twothirds of passenger traffic in the european union about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom according to unife the european market consists of about 33000 locomotives about 700000 freight cars and about 150000 passenger transit cars in recent years the european market purchased on average about 1300 new locomotives about 1000 new freight cars and about 7500 new passenger transit cars annually 

  

the asiapacific market is expected to be the secondlargest geographic segment by 2016 according to the unife study growth is expected to be driven by the continued urbanization of countries such as china and india and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries as well as in australia according to unife this market consists of about 34000 locomotives and about 10 million freight cars 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight group and the transit group both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers 

the freight group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives builds new switcher locomotives rebuilds freight locomotives supplies railway electronics positive train control equipment signal design and engineering services and provides related heat exchange and cooling systems customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars and utilities as discussed previously demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2010 the freight group accounted for 52 of our total sales with about twothirds of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers about twothirds of the freight group’s sales are in the aftermarket and the remainder in the original equipment market 

the transit group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world as discussed previously demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership in 2010 the transit group accounted for 48 of our total sales with about half of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers about half of the transit group’s sales are in the aftermarket and half in the original equipment market 

following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of positive train control technology which includes onboard locomotive computer and related software on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us by december 31 2015 as the leading supplier of onboard train control equipment wabtec is working with the railroads and transit authorities to implement this technology supported by our technical staff of over 550 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

 business strategy 

using wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we strive to improve quality delivery and productivity continuously and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 

  

  

   

  

 recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

wabtec has completed certain significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 expanding its presence in key geographic areas wabtec made several investments as of december 31 2010 the company acquired adantech a brazilian manufacturer of brake shoes and pads for subway cars locomotives and freight cars in september 2010 we formed a joint venture in china to manufacture transformer oil coolers generator coolers and related products for the power generation market for a 60 interest in hubei dengfeng unifin electrical equipment cooling system co ltd “unifin df” in december 2008 wabtec acquired the majority of beijing wabtec huaxia technology company ltd which manufactures friction products for the freight car market in china also in december 2008 the company formed a joint venture in shenyang china which manufactures braking related components for the china freight market increasing upon its original investment in september 2010 wabtec contributed an additional 80 million into this joint venture in 2008 the company formed a joint venture in south africa to manufacture friction products 

  

backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 108 billion at december 31 2010 for 2010 about 55 of sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time as such the company’s backlog is mostly an indicator of future original equipment sales primarily for the transit group and not aftermarket sales 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

 

 engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we invested about 402 million 424 million and 390 million respectively on product development and improvement activities the engineering resources of the company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts 

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have more than 1250 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

  

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe asia south africa and south america manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses and lessors of such equipment 

in 2010 about 46 of sales were to customers outside the us and to approximately 100 countries throughout the world about 55 of sales were in the aftermarket with a majority of our remaining sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 our top five customers accounted for 18 of net sales metrolinx formerly greater toronto transit authority eversholt formally hsbc rail uk ltd general electric transportation virginia railway express and csx transportation no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace 

employees 

at december 31 2010 we had 6654 fulltime employees approximately 28 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements are generally effective from 2011 through 2013 agreements expiring in 2011 cover approximately 11 of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

  

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes as a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period 

environmental matters 

information on environmental matters is included in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2010 our top five customers accounted for 18 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our 

  

dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government 

  

spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales have been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales will be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2010 approximately 46 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia malaysia mexico poland spain south africa and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

  

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

it is management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestosrelated bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors including 1 the asbestos case settlement history of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary rfpc 2 the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general and 3 the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular despite this uncertainty and although the results of the company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestosrelated lawsuits management believes that the final resolution of the company’s asbestosrelated cases will not be material to the company’s overall financial position results of operations and cash flows in general this belief is based upon 1 wabtec’s and rfpc’s history of settlements and dismissals of asbestosrelated cases to date 2 the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc’s product and 3 the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss 

more specifically as to rfpc management’s belief that any losses due to asbestosrelated cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims to date rfpc’s insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions the overall number of new claims being filed against rfpc has dropped significantly in recent years however these new claims and all previously filed claims may take a significant period of time to resolve as to wabtec and its divisions management’s belief that asbestosrelated cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims and that the former owners of wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue to date wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion all of which confirmed wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions these costs have not been material and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the 

  

raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 28 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements are generally effective from 2011 through 2013 agreements expiring in 2011 cover approximately 11 of the company’s workforce failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2010 we had total debt of 4221 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement along with carrying the 2715 million currently borrowed under this facility and the 1500 million 6875 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the indenture for our 150 million 6875 senior notes due in 2013 and our 2008 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the 2008 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2008 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2009 and 2010 we completed multiple acquisitions with a combined investment of 2215 million although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in approximately 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 17 countries in 2010 about 46 of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s shortterm operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity the freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic based on those fluctuations railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars in 2010 us freight rail traffic increased due to the improving overall economy and this has had a favorable effect on the company’s freight group deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars were lower than 2009 levels but order rates have picked up in recent quarters in 2010 revenue tonmiles increased 85 carloadings increased 73 and intermodal loadings increased 142 as rail traffic rebounded strongly from the 200809 economic recession in the us as a lingering effect from the recession 2010 deliveries of new freight locomotives decreased about 20 and deliveries of new freight cars decreased about 25 although both markets are expected to increase in 2011 about 15 of the company’s revenues are directly related to deliveries of new freight locomotives and freight cars so an improvement in those markets would have a favorable effect on the company’s financial results whether demand continues to improve will depend largely on continued strength in the overall economy and in rail traffic volumes 

in 2008 the us government enacted rail safety legislation that requires certain freight and passenger railroads to equip certain locomotives with positive train control technology by the end of 2015 this technology includes an onboard locomotive computer and related software which are being developed by wabtec as the industry leader wabtec expects to benefit from increased sales of train controlrelated products as the technology is deployed throughout the industry 

the north american transit rail industry is driven by government spending and ridership spending under safetealu the federal government’s transportation funding bill increased about 6 in 2009 and remained consistent in 2010 while ridership decreased about 4 and 1 in 2009 and 2010 respectively due to the recession and its impact on employment levels although safetealu was scheduled to expire in september 2009 the bill was extended through march 4 2011 with funding at about 2009 levels spending in 2011 is expected to remain at current levels at least until a new bill has been passed in early 2009 the us federal government passed new spending legislation designed to stimulate the us economy with up to 20 billion to be spent on freight and passenger transportation as follows 84 billion for public transportation 8 billion for highspeed rail 15 billion for discretionary intermodal projects and 13 billion for amtrak most of this funding has already been allocated to specific projects and wabtec expects to benefit slightly from this additional spending as transit authorities invest in new locomotives and buses 

  

in 2011 if the economy continues to improve the company expects conditions to generally improve in the freight rail market and to be slightly weaker in the passenger transit market demand for new freight cars and locomotives are expected to be higher due to increasing freight rail traffic in the passenger transit market the company believes that stable federal funding and ridership would result in stable demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts however most government entities at all levels are expected to continue facing budget issues which could have a negative effect on demand for the company’s products and services in response to current market conditions wabtec may continue to take certain actions to reduce costs including plant consolidations work force reductions and general spending cuts management believes these actions will not affect the company’s ability to continue to invest in its strategic growth initiatives 

wabtec continues to expand its presence in freight rail and passenger transit markets outside the us particularly in europe asiapacific and south america in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is much larger than the transit market in the us asiapacific is the fastestgrowing market segment led by china’s plans to spend at record levels 

in 2011 and beyond unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors cause instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer order or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

results of operations 

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 

 

   

2010 compared to 2009 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales increased by 1054 million to 15070 million in 2010 from 14016 million in 2009 the increase is due to higher freight group sales of 1002 million from original equipment and aftermarket and sales related to acquisitions of 861 million partially offsetting this increase was lower transit group sales of 851 million the company realized a net sales increase of 42 million due to favorable effects of foreign exchange but net earnings were generally not impacted by foreign exchange net income for 2010 was 1231 million or 256 per diluted share net income for 2009 was 1151 million or 239 per diluted share net income increased due to higher sales volume and operating margins partially offset by higher income tax expense 

freight group sales increased by 1961 million or 333 due to higher sales of 818 million from acquisitions 632 million for specialty products 204 million for brake products and 136 million for other freight products for the freight group net sales improved by 141 million due to the favorable effects of foreign exchange 

transit group’s sales decreased by 907 million or 112 due to lower brake product sales of 389 million lower transit related product sales of 263 million and other lower sales of 190 million from remanufacturing overhaul and build of locomotives partially offset by sales from acquisitions of 43 million transit group sales are lower due in part to the completion of major contracts as well as project delays and budget constraints at municipal transit authorities for the transit group net sales were reduced by 99 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange 

gross profit gross profit increased to 4491 million in 2010 compared to 3933 million in 2009 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix in 2010 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 298 compared to 281 in 2009 because of higher sales volume and mix of products the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales which can cause variability in warranty expense between quarters warranty expense was 24 million higher in 2010 compared to 2009 due to increased freight group sales the warranty reserve recorded on the balance sheet is 63 million higher at december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009 this is a result of higher warranty expense driven by higher sales and lower claims actually satisfied in particular certain transit group warranty reserves reflect provisions established for original equipment deliveries in 2010 

  

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses increased 349 million in 2010 compared to 2009 due to expenses from acquisitions and incentive and noncash compensation engineering expense decreased by 22 million in 2010 compared to 2009 as the company focused engineering resources on completing original equipment contracts costs related to engineering for specific customer contracts are included in cost of sales total operating expenses were 163 and 152 of sales for 2010 and 2009 respectively

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 341 and 296 in 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a benefit recorded in 2009 related to the settlement of examinations in various taxing jurisdictions 

net income net income for 2010 increased 80 million compared to 2009 the increase in net income is due to higher sales volume and operating margins partially offset by higher income tax expense 

2009 compared to 2008 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales decreased by 1732 million to 14016 million in 2009 from 15748 million in 2008 the decrease is due to the recession experienced during the previous 12 months which contributed to lower rail traffic and lower freight group sales sales related to acquisitions of 1149 million partially offset the decrease the company realized a net sales reduction of 351 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange but 

  

net earnings were generally not impacted by foreign exchange net income for 2009 was 1151 million or 239 per diluted share net income for 2008 was 1306 million or 266 per diluted share net income decreased due to lower freight group sales severance and other costs related to downsizing and consolidation actions partially offset by costsaving initiatives and lower income taxes net income was also decreased by the 39 million royalty charge included in selling general and administrative expenses related to the final award in the arbitration proceeding between faiveley transport malmo ab and wabtec 

freight group sales decreased by 1852 million or 239 due to lower sales of 1457 million for specialty products 1073 million for brake products and 215 million for remanufacturing overhaul and manufacturing of locomotives offsetting those reductions was an increase in sales of 1031 million from acquisitions

gross profit gross profit decreased to 3933 million in 2009 compared to 4272 million in 2008 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix in 2009 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 281 compared to 271 in 2008 the gross profit percentage increased due to realized cost savings from downsizing and consolidation actions and increased gross profit in the transit segment due to efficiencies realized on certain longterm contracts the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales which can cause variability in warranty between periods the provision for warranty expense was 34 million more in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to specific reserves on certain transit products the warranty reserve recorded on the balance sheet is 15 million lower at december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 this is a result of lower warranty expense compared to claims actually satisfied the balance sheet warranty reserve decreased at december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 due higher than normal settlement of claims 

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses decreased 96 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to costsavings initiatives along with lower costs related to incentive compensation plans partially offset by increased expenses from acquisitions engineering expenses increased by 34 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due mostly to acquisitions costs related to engineering for specific customer contracts are included in cost of sales amortization expense increased 48 million due to acquisitions during 2009 the company sold a facility for net cash proceeds of 36 million to an unrelated third party while certain portions of the building are being leased back this transaction resulted in a gain of 21 million and deferred gain of 06 million the deferred gain will be recognized over five years total operating expenses were 152 and 136 of sales for 2009 and 2008 respectively

the following table shows outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2010 and 2009 

 

 cash balance at december 31 2010 and 2009 was 2369 million and 1887 million respectively 

2008 refinancing credit agreement 

on november 4 2008 the company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “2008 refinancing credit agreement” provides the company with a 300 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and a 200 million fiveyear term loan facility the company incurred 29 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2008 refinancing credit agreement both facilities expire in january 2013 the 2008 refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below at december 31 2010 the weighted average interest rate on the company’s variable rate debt was 158 at december 31 2010 the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of 289 million of letters of credit of approximately 1371 million subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 

under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement the company may elect a base rate of interest or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” of interest “the alternate rate” the base rate adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the pnc na prime rate 30day libor plus 150 basis points or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points the alternate rate is based on quoted libor rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the initial base rate is 25 basis points and the alternate rate margin is 125 basis points to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowing during the term 

  

of the swap contract on december 31 2010 the notional value of the interest rate swap outstanding was 1370 million and effectively changed the company’s interest rate on bank debt at december 31 2010 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 227 the interest rate swap agreement matures at various times through december 2012 the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible 

the 2008 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2008 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 30 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325 the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities see note 8 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

6875 senior notes due august 2013 in august 2003 the company issued 150 million of senior notes due in 2013 “the notes” the notes were issued at par interest on the notes accrues at a rate of 6875 per annum and is payable semiannually on january 31 and july 31 of each year the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company’s existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes the principal balance is due in full at maturity 

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities 

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees the company has grouped these contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements into operating activities financing activities and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information the table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2010 

 

  

           

the above table does not reflect uncertain tax positions of 100 million the timing of which are uncertain except for 13 million that may become payable during 2011 refer to note 10 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on uncertain tax positions

obligations for financing activities cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of longterm debt repayments interest payments and dividend payments to shareholders the company has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders subject to quarterly approval by our board of directors currently at a rate of approximately 19 million annually 

the company arranges for performance bonds to be issued by third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts at december 31 2010 initial value of performance bonds issued on the company’s behalf is about 2267 million 

obligations for investing activities the company typically spends approximately 25 million to 35 million a year for capital expenditures primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization health and safety and environmental control the company expects annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variablerate debt the company’s variable rate debt represents 32 and 38 of total longterm debt at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively on an annual basis a 1 change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31 2010 would increase or decrease interest expense by 13 million 

to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowing during the term of the swap contract the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparty is a large financial institution with an excellent credit rating and history of performance the company currently believes the risk of nonperformance is negligible the company concluded that the interest rate swap agreement qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss net of tax on the balance sheet as of december 31 2010 the company had interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of 1370 million and which effectively changed the company’s interest rate on bank debt at december 31 2010 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 227 the interest rate swap agreements mature at various times through december 2012 as of december 31 2010 the company recorded a current liability of 25 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 15 million net of tax 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates forward contracts are agreements with counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date at the delivery date the company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis 

we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations as of december 31 2010 we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2010 

at december 31 2010 the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand zar and the purchase of us dollars usd the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss net of tax on the balance sheet as of december 31 2010 the company had forward contracts with a notional value of 247 million zar or 34 million us with an average exchange rate of 719 zar per 1 usd resulting in the recording of a current liability of 192000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of 122000 net of tax 

at december 31 2009 the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand zar and the purchase of us dollars usd the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss net of tax on the balance sheet as of december 31 2009 the company had forward contracts with a notional value of 101 million zar or 12 million us with an average exchange rate of 821 zar per 1 usd resulting in the recording of a current liability of 110000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of 70000 net of tax 

we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 54 of wabtec’s net sales were to the united states 11 to canada 3 to mexico 5 to australia 2 to germany 9 to the united kingdom and 16 in other international locations see note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31 2009

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars subway cars and buses in 2009 the company had sales of about 14 billion and net income of about 1151 million in 2009 sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 54 of total sales while sales to customers outside of the us accounted for about 40 of total sales 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries many factors influence these industries including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems 

according to a 2008 study by unife the association of the european rail industry the global market for railway products and services is more than 1000 billion the three largest markets which represent about 85 of the total market are europe north america and asiapacific over the next decade asiapacific is expected to be the fastestgrowing region and to surpass the north american market 

in north america railroads carry about 43 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods coal is the singlelargest item representing about 40 of carloadings in 2009 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america are driven by a number of factors including 

 

   

  

  

 in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles the new york city region is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

 outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world some governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies these investment programs represent opportunities for wabtec to provide products and services 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit france 

  

germany the united kingdom and italy are the largest transit markets representing about twothirds of passenger traffic in the european union about 75 of freight traffic in europe is hauled by truck while rail accounts for about 20 the largest freight markets in europe are germany poland and the united kingdom according to unife the european market consists of about 33000 locomotives about 700000 freight cars and about 150000 passenger transit cars in recent years the european market purchased on average about 1300 new locomotives about 1000 new freight cars and about 7500 new passenger transit cars annually 

the asiapacific market is expected to be the secondlargest geographic segment by 2016 according to the unife study growth is expected to be driven by the continued urbanization of countries such as china and india and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries as well as in australia according to unife this market consists of about 34000 locomotives and about 10 million freight cars in recent years china has embarked on a major rail capital investment program and is expected to spend a record amount of about 120 billion in 2010 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight group and the transit group both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers 

the freight group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives builds new switcher locomotives rebuilds freight locomotives and provides related heat exchange and cooling systems customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars and utilities as discussed previously demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2009 the freight group accounted for 42 of our total sales with about twothirds of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers about twothirds of the freight group’s sales are in the aftermarket and the remainder in the original equipment market 

the transit group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world as discussed previously demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership in 2009 the transit group accounted for 58 of our total sales with about half of its sales in north america and the remainder to international customers and about half in the aftermarket and half in the original equipment market 

following is a summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

 we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of positive train control technology on a majority of the locomotives and track in the us by december 31 2015 as the only supplier with a train control product that has received fra approval wabtec is working with the railroads and transit authorities to implement this technology supported by our technical staff of over 475 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers we currently own over 1250 active patents worldwide and over 500 us patents during the last three years we have filed for more than 350 patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

 

  

   

  

  

 business strategy 

using wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we strive to improve quality delivery and productivity continuously and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 

  

   

  

  

 recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

wabtec has completed certain acquisitions in support of its growth strategies on october 1 2009 the company used cash to acquire unifin international lp and its affiliate cardinal pumps and exchangers inc “unifin” a manufacturer of cooling systems and related equipment for the power generation and transmission industry for a net purchase price of 929 million 

in december 2008 the company acquired 100 of the stock of standard car truck company “sct” for 3026 million net of cash sct is a manufacturer and designer of stabilization systems for freight cars including engineered truck undercarriage components such as springs friction wedges and wear plates its barber ® brand truck design is used throughout the world and holds a leading share of the north american market the company also manufactures and services locomotives components including compressors and pumps in october 2008 the company acquired certain assets related to the development sale service and maintenance of software programs used in train management systems for 45 million in june 2008 the company acquired 100 of the stock of poli spa “poli” for €552 million 870 million net of cash received poli is a europeanbased manufacturer of rail braking equipment including brake discs for highspeed applications as well as tread brake units and pneumatic brake valves that meet international union of railways “uic” standards 

in june 2007 the company acquired 100 of the stock of ricon corporation “ricon” a manufacturer of a variety of electromechanical wheelchair lifts and ramps and antigraffiti windows for 736 million 

during 2008 wabtec expanded its presence in key geographic areas wabtec acquired the majority of beijing wabtec huaxia technology company ltd which manufactures friction products for the freight car market and invested in a joint venture in china to manufacture other brakingrelated components in addition the company formed a joint venture in south africa to manufacture friction products 

backlog 

the company’s backlog was about 951 million at december 31 2009 

in 2009 about 54 of our sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days so they are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time as such the company’s backlog is mostly an indicator of future original equipment sales primarily for the transit group and not aftermarket sales 

  

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

 

 engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we invested about 424 million 390 million and 374 million respectively on product development and improvement activities sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are beginning to conduct pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have more than 1250 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by 

  

acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe asia and south africa manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses and lessors of such equipment 

in 2009 about 40 of our sales were to customers outside the us and to approximately 100 countries throughout the world about 54 of our sales were in the aftermarket with a majority of our remaining sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 our top five customers alstom metrolinx formerly go transit “greater toronto transit authority” kawasaki railcar inc ge transportation systems and hsbc rail accounted for 22 of our net sales no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are generally much smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary across product lines but most competitors tend to be privately held companies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace 

employees 

at december 31 2009 we had 5812 fulltime employees approximately 37 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements generally extend through 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 agreements expiring in 2010 cover approximately 21 of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with our employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight 

  

cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes as a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period 

environmental matters 

information on environmental matters is included in note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 our top five customers alstom metrolinx formerly go transit “greater toronto transit authority” kawasaki railcar inc ge transportation systems and hsbc rail accounted for 22 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an asneeded basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

  

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors in addition we may incur additional warranty or other costs as new products are tested and used by customers 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

  

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales have been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales may be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2009 approximately 40 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia brazil canada china czech republic france germany india italy macedonia malaysia mexico poland spain south africa and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors or insurers will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

  

it is management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestosrelated bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors including 1 the asbestos case settlement history of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary rfpc 2 the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general and 3 the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular despite this uncertainty and although the results of the company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestosrelated lawsuits management believes that the final resolution of the company’s asbestosrelated cases will not be material to the company’s overall financial position results of operations and cash flows in general this belief is based upon 1 wabtec’s and rfpc’s history of settlements and dismissals of asbestosrelated cases to date 2 the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc’s product and 3 the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss 

more specifically as to rfpc management’s belief that any losses due to asbestosrelated cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims to date rfpc’s insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions the overall number of new claims being filed against rfpc has dropped significantly in recent years however these new claims and all previously filed claims may take a significant period of time to resolve as to wabtec and its divisions management’s belief that asbestosrelated cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims and that the former owners of wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue to date wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion all of which confirmed wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions these costs have not been material and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs affect the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs 

the company has followed the current debate over climate change and the related policy discussion and prospective legislation the potential challenges for the company that climate change policy and legislation may pose have been reviewed by the company any such challenges are heavily dependent on the nature and degree of climate change legislation and the extent to which it applies to our industry at this time the company cannot predict the ultimate impact of climate change and climate change legislation on the company’s operations further when or if these impacts may occur cannot be assessed until scientific analysis and legislative policy are more developed and specific legislative proposals begin to take shape any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of greenhouse gas could require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our products in addition the price and availability of certain of the raw materials that we use could vary in the future as a result of environmental laws and regulations affecting our suppliers an increase in the price of our raw materials or a decline in their availability could adversely affect our operating margins or result in reduced demand for our products 

  

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 37 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 agreements expiring in 2010 cover approximately 21 of the company’s workforce failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2009 we had total debt of 3918 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement along with carrying the 2410 million currently borrowed under this facility and the 1500 million 6875 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 the indenture for our 150 million 6875 senior notes due in 2013 and our 2008 refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

  

the 2008 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2008 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2008 and 2009 we completed the acquisition of poli sct and unifin for a combined 4826 million net of cash received although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in approximately 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 17 countries in 2009 about 40 of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s shortterm operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity the freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic based on those fluctuations railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotives and freight cars in 2009 the us economy in general and the company specifically were impacted by the global economic recession during the year this was particularly true for the company’s freight segment in the us for example freight revenue tonmiles and carloadings were down 151 and 161 respectively although they did improve slightly in the second half of the year with rail traffic down significantly railroads put a portion of their locomotive and freight car fleets in storage and reduced purchases of new equipment as a result 2009 deliveries of new freight locomotives decreased about 50 and deliveries of new freight cars decreased about 65 although less than 15 of the company’s revenues are directly related to deliveries of new freight locomotives and freight cars the decline in those markets had a material impact on the company’s financial results to mitigate this impact wabtec initiated a series of restructuring actions that included plant consolidations a work force reduction and other cost reduction efforts 

the north american transit rail industry is driven by government spending and ridership spending increased about 6 in 2009 while ridership decreased about 4 due to the economy in february 2009 the us federal government passed new spending legislation designed to stimulate the us economy of the 789 billion spending package up to 20 billion is to be spent on freight and passenger transportation as follows 84 billion for public transportation 8 billion for highspeed rail 15 billion for discretionary intermodal projects and 13 billion for amtrak wabtec expects to benefit from this additional spending as transit authorities invest in expansion new equipment and other related projects 

in 2010 the company expects conditions to remain challenging in the freight rail market and generally stable in the passenger transit market demand for new freight cars and locomotives are expected to be lower due to the railroads’ amount of surplus equipment in the passenger transit market the company believes that increases in federal funding and stable ridership will continue to have a beneficial effect on the demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts in response to current market conditions wabtec may continue to take certain actions to reduce costs including plant consolidations work force reductions and general spending cuts management believes these actions will not affect the company’s ability to continue to invest in its strategic growth initiatives 

  

in 2010 and beyond unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that the economy is slow to recover and results in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

wabtec downsized its canadian operations by moving certain products to lowercost facilities and outsourcing in the freight segment wabtec recorded charges of 46 million and 36 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively no charges for these operations and this restructuring plan were recorded in the year ended december 31 2009 for these operations cumulative expenses for restructuring and other expenses recorded since 2006 have been 165 million comprised of the 57 million for employee severance costs for approximately 400 employees 55 million of pension and postretirement benefit curtailment for those employees and 53 million related to fixed asset and goodwill impairment goodwill impairment was recorded as amortization expense and most of the other charges were recorded in cost of sales severance costs are contractual liabilities and payment is dependent on the waiver by or expiration of certain seniority rights of those employees as of december 31 2009 42 million of this amount had been paid 

results of operations 

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 

 

   

2009 compared to 2008 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales decreased by 1732 million to 14016 million in 2009 from 15748 million in 2008 the decrease is due to the recession experienced during the previous twelve months which contributed to lower rail traffic and lower freight group sales sales related to acquisitions of 1149 million partially offset the decrease the company realized a net sales reduction of 351 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange but net earnings were generally not impacted by foreign exchange 

net income for 2009 was 1151 million or 239 per diluted share net income for 2008 was 1306 million or 266 per diluted share net income decreased due to lower freight group sales severance and other costs related to downsizing and consolidation actions partially offset by costsaving initiatives and lower income taxes net income was also decreased by the 39 million royalty charge included in selling general and administrative expenses related to the final award in the arbitration proceeding between faiveley transport malmo ab and wabtec 

net sales by segment the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

 

 freight group sales decreased by 1852 million or 239 due to lower sales of 1457 million for specialty products 1073 million for brake products and 215 million for remanufacturing overhaul and manufacturing of locomotives offsetting those reductions was an increase in sales of 1031 million from acquisitions transit group sales increased by 120 million or 15 due to 

increased sales of 171 million for brake products 250 million for other transit related products and 118 million from acquisitions offsetting those increases was a decrease in sales of 100 million for remanufacturing overhaul and build of locomotives for the transit group net sales were reduced by 309 million due to unfavorable effects of foreign exchange on sales mentioned above 

gross profit gross profit decreased to 3933 million in 2009 compared to 4272 million in 2008 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix in 2009 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 281 compared to 271 in 2008 the gross profit percentage increased due to realized cost savings from downsizing and consolidation actions and increased gross profit in the transit segment due to efficiencies realized on certain longterm contracts the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales the provision for warranty expense was 34 more in 2009 compared to 2008 due primarily to specific reserves on certain transit products the warranty reserve decreased at december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 by 15 million due to claims paid on certain freight products 

  

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses 

 

 selling general and administrative expenses decreased 96 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to costsaving initiatives partially offset by increased expenses from acquisitions engineering expenses increased by 34 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to acquisitions offset partially by costsaving initiatives amortization expense increased 48 million due to acquisitions during 2009 the company sold a facility for net cash proceeds of 36 million to an unrelated third party while certain portions of the building are being leased back this transaction resulted in a gain of 21 million and deferred gain of 06 million the deferred gain will be recognized over five years total operating expenses were 152 and 136 of sales for 2009 and 2008 respectively 

income from operations income from operations totaled 1800 million or 128 of sales in 2009 compared to 2125 million or 135 of sales in 2008 income from operations decreased due to lower freight group sales severance and other costs related to downsizing and consolidation actions and the royalty payment to faiveley transport malmo ab partially offset by costsaving initiatives 

interest expense net interest expense net increased 81 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to acquisition financing 

other expense net other expense net decreased 03 million in 2009 compared to 2008 the company recorded foreign exchange expense of 13 million due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings this was offset by 10 million of other miscellaneous income 

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 296 and 361 in 2009 and 2008 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the settlement of examinations in various taxing jurisdictions during 2009 

net income net income for 2009 decreased 155 million compared to 2008 the decrease in net income is due primarily to lower sales 

2008 compared to 2007 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales increased by 2147 million to 15748 million in 2008 from 13601 million in 2007 the increase is due to internal growth from increased sales of 553 million for brake products 368 million for 

  

contracts related to transit authorities 218 million in remanufacturing overhaul and build of locomotives and 166 million for heat exchangers sales related to acquisitions also contributed 593 million to the increase sales related to international expansion also contributed 18 million to the increase offsetting these increases the company did realize a net sales decrease of 122 million due to foreign exchange but net earnings are mostly not impacted by foreign exchange

gross profit gross profit increased to 4272 million in 2008 compared to 3696 million in 2007 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix in 2008 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 271 compared to 272 in 2007 the gross profit percentage was flat due to the changing mix of revenues from freight to transit as transit margins tend to be lower than freight this was offset by ongoing efficiency and cost saving initiatives the provision for warranty expense is generally established for specific losses along with historical estimates of customer claims as a percentage of sales the provision for warranty expense was 107 more in 2008 compared to 2007 because of increased sales particularly for large transit authority contracts which ramped up in 2008 the warranty reserve increased at december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 by 84 million due to 4 million from acquisitions completed in 2008 and primarily from customer claims or transit authority contracts

other expense net other expense net decreased 39 million in 2008 compared to 2007 the company recorded foreign exchange expense of 399000 and 32 million respectively in 2008 and 2007 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 361 and 366 in 2008 and 2007 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of a 10 million net tax benefit recognized in 2008 due to the expiration of statutory review periods and current examinations in various tax jurisdictions

receivable continued to increase due to higher overall sales the increase was less than the increase in 2007 which resulted in a 108 million improvement inventories increased in 2008 about 284 million more than 2007 due to higher inventory on hand for large contracts requirements and overall higher sales activity accounts payable increased less in 2008 compared to 2007 by 184 million resulting in less cash generated customer deposits and other accruals increased compared to 2007 resulting in a cash increase of 358 million cash was generated due to the collection of large customer deposits on certain long term contracts other assets and liabilities including accrued income taxes used cash of 91 million compared to 2007

2008 refinancing credit agreement 

on november 4 2008 the company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “2008 refinancing credit agreement” provides the company with a 300 million fiveyear revolving credit facility and a 200 million fiveyear term loan facility the company incurred 29 million of deferred financing cost related to the 2008 refinancing credit agreement both facilities expire in january 2013 the 2008 refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below at december 31 2009 the weighted average interest rate on the company’s variable rate debt was 149 at december 31 2009 the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of 286 million of letters of credit of approximately 2004 million subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 

under the 2008 refinancing credit agreement the company may elect a base rate of interest or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” of interest “the alternate rate” the base rate 

  

adjusts on a daily basis and is the greater of the pnc na prime rate 30day libor plus 150 basis points or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum plus a margin that ranges from 25 to 50 basis points the alternate rate is based on quoted libor rates plus a margin that ranges from 125 to 200 basis points both the base rate and alternate rate margins are dependent on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the base rate margin is zero basis points and the initial alternate rate margin is 125 basis points to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowing during the term of the swap contract on december 31 2009 the notional value of the interest rate swap outstanding was 925 million and effectively changed the company’s interest rate on bank debt at december 31 2009 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 184 the interest rate swap agreement matures in january 2010 the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparty is a large financial institution and the company does not anticipate nonperformance 

the 2008 refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the 2008 refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio of 30 and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325 the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

6875 senior notes due august 2013 in august 2003 the company issued 150 million of senior notes due in 2013 “the notes” the notes were issued at par interest on the notes accrues at a rate of 6875 per annum and is payable semiannually on january 31 and july 31 of each year the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company’s existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes the principal balance is due in full at maturity 

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities 

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees the company has grouped these contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements into operating activities financing activities and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information the table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2009

to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into an interest rate swap which effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowing during the term of the swap contract the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparty is a large financial institution and the company does not anticipate nonperformance the company concluded that the interest rate swap agreement qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the interest rate swap agreement and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss net of tax on the balance sheet as of december 31 2009 the company had an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of 925 million and which effectively changed the company’s interest rate on bank debt at december 31 2009 from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 184 the interest rate swap agreement matures in january 2010 as of december 31 2009 the company recorded a current liability of 63000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 38000 net of tax 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date at the delivery date the company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis 

we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations as of december 31 2009 we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2010 

at december 31 2009 the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand zar and the purchase of us dollars usd the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss net of tax on the balance sheet as of december 31 2009 the company had forward contracts with a notional value of 101 million zar or 12 million us with an average exchange rate of 821 zar per 1 usd resulting in the recording of a current liability of 110000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of 70000 net of tax 

at december 31 2008 the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand zar and the purchase of us dollars usd the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss net of tax on the balance sheet as of december 31 2008 the company had forward contracts with a notional value of 50 million zar or 557000 us with an average exchange rate of 897 zar per 1 usd resulting in the recording of a current asset of 41000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of 26000 net of tax 

we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 60 of wabtec’s net sales were to the united states 10 to canada 2 to mexico 4 to australia 2 to germany 10 to the united kingdom and 12 in other international locations see note 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31 2008

 item 1 business tableend general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars subway cars and buses in 2008 the company had sales of approximately 16 billion and net income of approximately 1306 million sales of aftermarket parts and services represented approximately 53 of total sales in 2008 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and passenger transit rail industries as such our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry many factors influence the industry including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government spending on public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 41 of wabtec’s sales in 2008 

according to a 2008 study by unife the association of the european rail industry the global market for railway products and services is more than 1000 billion the three largest markets which represent about 85 of the total market are europe north america and asiapacific over the next decade asiapacific is expected to be the fastestgrowing region and to surpass the north american market 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods coal is the singlelargest item representing about 45 of carloadings in 2008 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america are driven by a number of factors including 

 

   

  

  

 in the us the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles the new york city region is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

 outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world some governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies these investment programs represent opportunities for wabtec to provide products and services 

in europe the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market which is expected to continue growing as high fuel costs and environmental factors encourage investment in public mass transit in addition countries such as england are experiencing growth in the freight market due to an increasing market share compared to trucking according to unife the european freight market consists of about 33000 locomotives and about 700000 freight cars 

  

the asiapacific market is expected to be the secondlargest geographic segment by 2016 according to the unife study growth is expected to be driven by the continued urbanization of countries such as china and india and by investment in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries as well as in australia according to unife this market consists of about 34000 locomotives and about 10 million freight cars 

business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight group and the transit group both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers the freight group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives builds new switcher locomotives and rebuilds freight locomotives customers include large publicly traded railroads leasing companies and manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars around the world as discussed previously demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars in 2008 the freight group accounted for 49 of our total sales with the majority of its sales in north america and about half of its sales in the aftermarket 

the transit group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars customers include public transit authorities and municipalities leasing companies and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world as discussed previously demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership in 2008 the transit group accounted for 51 of our total sales with the majority of its sales outside of north america and about half of its sales in the aftermarket 

following is a summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry in 2008 the us federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of positive train control technology on a majority of the locomotives and track in 

  

the us by december 31 2015 and wabtec is working with the railroads to implement this technology supported by our technical staff of over 600 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers we currently own over 1500 active patents worldwide and over 600 us patents during the last three years we have filed for more than 340 patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines 

for additional information on our business segments see note 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

 

  

  

  

   

 business strategy 

using wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we strive to improve quality delivery and productivity continuously and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product reliability and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time we expect these lean initiatives to enable us to increase operating margins which would improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 

  

  

   

 recent acquisitions and joint ventures 

in 2008 wabtec completed three acquisitions and three investments in support of its growth strategies on december 5 2008 the company acquired 100 of the stock of standard car truck company for 3029 million net of cash received standard car truck is a leading manufacturer and designer of stabilization systems for freight cars including engineered truck undercarriage components such as springs friction wedges and wear plates its barber ® brand truck design is used throughout the world and holds a leading share of the north american market the company also manufactures and services locomotives components including compressors and pumps we believe that the combination of wabtec braking products with standard car truck’s undercarriage products will lead to a competitive advantage over time for the company 

on october 27 2008 the company acquired certain assets related to the development sale service and maintenance of software programs used in train management systems for 45 million 

on june 30 2008 the company acquired 100 of the stock of poli spa “poli” for €522 million 823 million net of cash received poli is a europeanbased manufacturer of rail braking equipment including brake discs for highspeed applications as well as tread brake units and pneumatic brake valves that meet international union of railways “uic” standards because of its historic focus on the north american market wabtec did not previously offer products to meet uic standards wabtec expects to benefit over time from poli’s uicapproved products as well as the future development and certification of additional products 

during 2008 wabtec expanded its presence in key geographic areas wabtec acquired the majority of beijing wabtec huaxia technology company ltd which manufactures friction products for the freight car market and invested in a joint venture in china to manufacture other brakingrelated components in addition the company formed a joint venture in south africa to manufacture friction products 

in 2006 and 2007 wabtec completed three acquisitions in june 2007 the company acquired 100 of the stock of ricon corporation “ricon” a manufacturer of a variety of electromechanical wheelchair lifts and ramps and antigraffiti windows for 736 million in december 2006 the company acquired 100 of the stock of becorit gmbh “becorit” a manufacturer of a variety of brake shoes pads and friction linings for passenger transit cars freight cars and locomotives and friction products for industrial markets such as mining and wind power generation for 513 million in october 2006 the company acquired 100 of the stock of schaefer equipment inc “schaefer” a manufacturer of a variety of forged components for bodymounted and truckmounted braking systems for 367 million 

backlog 

the company’s backlog was approximately 11 billion at december 31 2008 as additional contracts booked in the transit group offset a reduction in backlog for the freight group 

in 2008 about 53 of our sales came from aftermarket orders which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days so they are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time as such the company’s backlog is mostly an indicator of future original equipment sales primarily for the transit group not expected aftermarket activity 

  

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

 

 engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 we invested about 390 million 374 million and 327 million respectively on product development and improvement activities approximately 40 of these costs comprise of activities devoted to new product development in any given year these engineering and development expenditures in total represent about 25 28 and 30 of net sales for the same periods respectively sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are beginning to conduct pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have more than 1500 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

  

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe asia and south africa manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses lessors of such equipment and passenger transit authorities primarily those in north america 

in 2008 approximately 41 of our sales were to customers outside the us and to 104 countries throughout the world approximately 53 of our sales were in the aftermarket with the rest of our sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2008 our top five customers greater toronto transit authority go transit ge transportation systems maryland department of transportation trinity industries and alstom accounted for 27 of our net sales no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are generally much smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary to some extent across product lines but most competitors tend to be privately held companies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace 

employees 

at december 31 2008 we had 7295 fulltime employees approximately 32 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements generally extend through 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 agreements expiring in 2009 cover approximately 19 of the company’s workforce we consider our relations with our employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

  

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes as a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period

 item 1a risk factors tableend prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally including as a result of terrorist activities and the military response by the united states and other countries could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2008 our top five customers greater toronto transit authority go transit ge transportation systems maryland department of transportation trinity industries and alstom accounted for 27 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical 

  

industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors 

  

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales have been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales may be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2008 approximately 41 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia canada china france germany india italy kunta hora macedonia malaysia mexico poland spain south africa and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

  

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products over the last four years the overall number of new claims filed has significantly decreased as compared to the previous four year period however the resolution of these new claims and all previously filed claims may take a significant period of time most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

it is management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestosrelated bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors including 1 the limited asbestos case settlement history of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary rfpc 2 the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general and 3 the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular despite this uncertainty and although the results of the company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestosrelated lawsuits management believes that the final resolution of the company’s asbestosrelated cases will not be material to the company’s overall financial position results of operations and cash flows in general this belief is based upon 1 wabtec’s and rfpc’s limited history of settlements and dismissals of asbestosrelated cases to date 2 the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc’s product and 3 the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss 

more specifically as to rfpc management’s belief that any losses due to asbestosrelated cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims to date rfpc’s insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions as to wabtec and its divisions management’s belief that asbestosrelated cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims and that the former owners of wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue to date wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion all of which confirmed wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions these costs have not been material and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 104 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 16 countries in 2008 about 41 of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s shortterm operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity the freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic based on those fluctuations railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotive and freight cars growth in the us economy slowed in 2008 which led to a decrease in rail traffic during the year deliveries of new locomotives increased about 25 during the year in part due to strong international demand for usbuilt locomotives deliveries of new freight cars decreased about 50 in 2008 due in part to the slowing economic conditions and resulting decrease in rail traffic about 20 of the company’s revenues are directly related to deliveries of new freight cars at december 31 2008 the industry backlog of freight cars ordered was 31921 compared to 75860 at the end of the prior year 

the north american transit rail industry is primarily driven by government spending and ridership which increased 8 and 5 respectively in 2008 in february 2009 the us federal government passed new spending legislation designed to stimulate the us economy of the 789 billion spending package up to 20 billion is to be spent on freight and passenger transportation as follows 84 billion for public transportation 8 billion for highspeed rail 15 billion for discretionary intermodal projects and 13 billion for amtrak the majority of this money is to be spent by september 2010 wabtec expects to benefit from this additional spending as transit authorities invest in expansion new equipment and other related projects 

in 2009 the company expects conditions to slow in its freight rail and to remain generally stable in its passenger transit rail markets demand for new freight cars is expected to be lower in the passenger transit rail market the company believes that increases in ridership and federal funding will continue to have a positive effect on the demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts in addition the company has a strong backlog of transitrelated projects some of which are expected to generate increased revenues in 2009 in response to current market conditions wabtec expects to take certain actions to reduce costs including plant consolidations work force reductions and general spending cuts management believes these actions will not affect the company’s ability to continue to invest in its strategic growth initiatives 

in 2009 and beyond we will continue to face many challenges including a weaker economy higher costs for medical and insurance premiums and foreign currency fluctuations unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw 

  

materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected in addition we face risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

wabtec downsized two of its canadian plants in stoney creek and wallaceburg by moving certain products to lowercost facilities and outsourcing for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 wabtec recorded charges of 46 million 36 million and 68 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2007 additional severance pension and asset impairment charges of 15 million were recorded related to other canadian operations all of these costs were paid as of december 31 2008 

total charges for restructuring and other expenses recorded to date have been 165 million comprised of the 57 million for employee severance costs associated for approximately 400 salaried and hourly employees 55 million of pension and postretirement benefit curtailment for those employees 48 million related to asset impairments for structures machinery and equipment and 541000 for goodwill impairment severance costs are contractual liabilities and payment is dependent on the waiver by or expiration of certain seniority rights of those employees as of december 31 2008 39 million of this amount had been paid

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities 

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees the company has grouped these contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements into operating activities financing activities and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information the table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2008 

 

  

           

the above table does not reflect uncertain tax positions of 171 million the timing of which are uncertain except for 484000 that may become payable during 2009 refer to note 11 of the “notes to consolidated financial statements” for additional information on uncertain tax positions 

obligations for operating activities the company has entered into 367 million of material longterm noncancelable materials and supply purchase obligations operating leases represent multiyear obligations for rental of facilities and equipment estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates expected return on longterm assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates benefits paid for pension obligations were 148 million and 104 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively benefits paid for post retirement plans were 20 million and 22 million in 2008 and in 2007 respectively 

obligations for financing activities cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of longterm debt repayments interest payments and dividend payments to shareholders the company has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders subject to quarterly approval by our board of directors currently at a rate of approximately 19 million annually 

the company arranges for performance bonds to be issued by third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts at december 31 2008 initial value of performance bonds issued on the company’s behalf is about 1901 million 

obligations for investing activities the company typically spends approximately 20 million to 30 million a year for capital expenditures primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization health and safety and environmental control the company expects annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives environmental matters warranty reserves the testing of goodwill and other 

  

intangibles for impairment proceeds on assets to be sold pensions and other postretirement benefits and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 19 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variablerate debt the company’s variable rate debt represents 61 and 0 of total longterm debt at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively on an annual basis a 1 change in the interest rate for variable rate debt at december 31 2008 would increase or decrease interest expense by 23 million 

foreign currency exchange risk 

the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date at the delivery date the company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis 

we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations as of december 31 2008 we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2009 

at december 31 2008 the company had forward contracts for the sale of south african rand zar and the purchase of us dollars usd the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss net of tax on the balance sheet as of december 31 2008 the company had forward contracts with a notional value of 50 million zar or 557000 us with an average exchange rate of 897 zar per 1 usd resulting in the recording of a current asset of 41000 and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive income of 26000 net of tax 

at december 31 2007 the company had forward contracts for the sale of usd and the purchase of euro with a notional value of €23 million euro or 31 million usd with an average exchange rate of 132 usd per €1 euro these forward contracts are used to mitigate the variability in cash flows from the payment of liabilities denominated in currencies other than the usd since the company does not treat these derivatives as hedges the change in fair value of both the forward contracts and the related liabilities are recorded in the income statement in 2007 the company recorded a fair value gain in the amount of 315000 

we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 59 of wabtec’s net sales were to the united states 9 to canada 3 to mexico 5 to australia 2 to germany 11 to the united kingdom and 11 in other international locations see note 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31 2007

 item 1 business tableend general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc now known as trane “trane” in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and subway cars in 2007 the company had sales of approximately 14 billion and net income of approximately 1096 million sales of aftermarket parts and services represented over 50 of total sales in 2007 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and passenger transit rail industries the worldwide market for rail equipment has been estimated to be about 70 billion annually our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry many factors influence the industry including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government investment in public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems customers outside of the us accounted for about 40 of wabtec’s sales in 2007 

in north america railroads carry about 40 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods coal is the singlelargest item representing about 40 of carloadings in 2007 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world many governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies these investment programs represent additional opportunities for wabtec to provide products and services 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

   

in the us passenger transit is a 32 billion industry dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles new york city is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities offer either rail or bus transit services 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

 business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight group and the transit group the freight group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives builds new switcher locomotives and rebuilds freight locomotives the transit group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars both business segments serve original equipment manufacturers oems and provide aftermarket sales and services with the aftermarket accounting for about 50 of net sales some business units within the operating groups serve both freight rail and passenger transit rail customers in 2007 the freight group accounted for 54 of our total net sales and the transit group accounted for the remaining 46 in 2007 the freight group generated 49 of its net sales from the aftermarket and 51 of its net sales from the oems the transit group generated 53 of its net sales from the aftermarket and 47 of its net sales from oems a summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments is outlined below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we manufacture sell and service highquality electronics for railroads in the form of onboard systems and braking for locomotives and freight cars we harden our products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments recently we have concentrated our new product development on extending electronic technology to braking equipment and control systems 

we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation our new product development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and controls over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic brakes and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry the transit group also focuses on new product development and has introduced a number of new products during the past several years supported by our technical staff of over 450 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers we currently own over 1300 active patents worldwide and over 500 us patents during the last three years we have filed for more than 260 patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

business strategy 

using the wabtec performance system wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies as outlined below through wps we believe we can build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product quality and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time we expect these lean initiatives to enable us to increase operating margins which would improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 

  

  

  

 recent acquisitions 

in 2006 and 2007 wabtec completed three acquisitions in support of its growth strategies on june 8 2007 the company acquired 100 of the stock of ricon corporation ricon a manufacturer of a variety of electromechanical wheelchair lifts and ramps and antigraffiti windows for 736 million on december 1 2006 the company acquired 100 of the stock of becorit gmbh becorit a manufacturer of a variety of brake shoes pads and friction linings for passenger transit cars freight cars and locomotives and friction products for industrial markets such as mining and wind power generation for 513 million on october 6 2006 the company acquired 100 of the stock of schaefer equipment inc schaefer a manufacturer of a variety of forged components for bodymounted and truckmounted braking systems for 367 million 

backlog 

the company’s backlog remained at 10 billion at dec 31 2007 as additional contracts booked in the transit group offset a reduction in backlog for the freight group 

in 2007 over 50 of our sales came from aftermarket orders aftermarket orders typically carry lead times of less than 30 days so they are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time as such the company’s backlog is mostly an indicator of future original equipment sales primarily for the transit group not expected aftermarket activity 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

  

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

 

 engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we invested about 374 million 327 million and 328 million respectively on product development and improvement activities approximately 40 of these costs comprise activities devoted to new product development in any given year these engineering and development expenditures in total represent about 28 30 and 32 of net sales for the same periods respectively sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years and freight railroads are beginning to conduct pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have more than 1300 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc now known as trane in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of trane other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe south africa and india manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses lessors of such equipment and passenger transit authorities primarily those in north america 

in 2007 about 40 of our sales were to customers outside the us and to more than 100 countries throughout the world about 50 of our sales were in the aftermarket with the rest of our sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

  

our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2007 our top five customers electromotive diesel greater toronto transit authority go transit ge transportation systems trinity industries and alstom accounted for 23 of our net sales in 2007 no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold approximately a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines on a global basis our market shares are generally much smaller we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support 

our principal competitors vary to some extent across product lines but most competitors tend to be privately held companies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace 

employees 

at december 31 2007 we had 6023 fulltime employees approximately 37 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements generally extend through 2008 2009 and 2010 we consider our relations with our employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes as a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business our top customers can change from year to year for the fiscal year ended december 31 2007 our top five customers electromotive diesel greater toronto transit authority go transit ge transportation systems trinity industries and alstom accounted for 23 of our net sales in 2007 while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical industries as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than we do price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and alliances that we believe will improve our market position and provide opportunities to realize operating synergies these transactions involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

  

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales has been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales may be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally including as a result of terrorist activities and the military response by the united states and other countries could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2007 about 40 of our consolidated net sales were to customers outside of the us and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia canada china france germany india italy mexico spain south africa and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products since 2000 the number of such claims has increased and the resolution of these claims may take a significant period of time most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc on april 17 2005 a claim against the company by a former stockholder of rfpc contending that the company assumed that entity’s liability for asbestos claims arising from exposure to rfpc’s product was resolved in the company’s favor 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

  

it is management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestosrelated bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present due to a variety of factors including 1 the limited asbestos case settlement history of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary rfpc 2 the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general and 3 the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular despite this uncertainty and although the results of the company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestosrelated lawsuits management believes that the final resolution of the company’s asbestosrelated cases will not be material to the company’s overall financial position results of operations and cash flows in general this belief is based upon 1 wabtec’s and rfpc’s limited history of settlements and dismissals of asbestosrelated cases to date 2 the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc’s product and 3 the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss 

more specifically as to rfpc management’s belief that any losses due to asbestosrelated cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims to date rfpc’s insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions as to wabtec and its divisions management’s belief that asbestosrelated cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims and that the former owners of wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue to date wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion all of which confirmed wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions these costs have not been material and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 37 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through 2008 2009 and 2010 failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

  

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2007 we have total debt of 1503 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the refinancing credit agreement along with carrying the 150 million 6 78 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 the indenture for our 150 million 6 78 senior notes due in 2013 and our refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in 2006 and 2007 we completed the acquisition of 100 of the stock of schaefer becorit and ricon for a combined 1616 million net of cash received although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 12 countries in 2007 about 40 of the company’s revenues came from customers outside the us 

management review and outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management evaluates the company’s shortterm operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

the company monitors a variety of factors and statistics to gauge market activity the freight rail industry is largely driven by general economic conditions which can cause fluctuations in rail traffic based on those fluctuations railroads can increase or decrease purchases of new locomotive and freight cars growth in the us economy slowed in 2007 which led to a slight decrease in rail traffic during the year deliveries of new locomotives increased about 10 during the year in part due to strong international demand for usbuilt locomotives the company expects demand for new locomotives to remain strong in 2008 deliveries of new freight cars decreased about 15 in 2007 due in part to the decrease in rail traffic only about 20 of the company’s revenues are directly related to deliveries of new freight cars at dec 31 2007 the industry backlog of freight cars ordered was 75860 compared to 85826 at the end of the prior year 

the north american transit rail industry is primarily driven by government spending and ridership which increased 8 and 2 respectively in 2007 

in 2008 the company expects conditions to remain generally favorable in its freight rail and passenger transit rail markets demand for new locomotives is expected to be slightly higher than in 2007 while demand for new freight cars is expected to be lower in the passenger transit rail market the company believes that increases in ridership and federal funding will continue to have a positive effect on the demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts in addition the company has a strong backlog of transitrelated projects some of which are expected to generate increased revenues in 2008 

in 2008 and beyond we will continue to face many challenges including increased costs for raw materials higher costs for medical and insurance premiums and foreign currency fluctuations in addition we face general economic risks as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

  

wabtec downsized two of its canadian plants in stoney creek and wallaceburg by moving certain products to lowercost facilities and outsourcing for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 wabtec recorded charges of 36 million and 68 million respectively total charges for restructuring and other expenses recorded to date have been 104 million comprised of the 29 million for employee severance costs associated for approximately 330 salaried and hourly employees 41 million of pension and postretirement benefit curtailment for those employees 29 million related to asset impairments for structures machinery and equipment and 541000 for goodwill impairment specific to the wallaceburg facility severance costs are contractual liabilities and payment is dependent on the waiver by or expiration of certain seniority rights of those employees as of december 31 2007 12 million of this amount had been paid 

for the year ended december 31 2007 additional severance pension and asset impairment charges of 15 million were recorded related to other canadian operations all but 276000 of these costs were paid as of december 31 2007 

results of operations

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales increased by 2725 million to 13601 million in 2007 from 10876 million in 2006 the increase is primarily due to internal growth from increased sales of 694 million for locomotives 303 million for refurbishing transit cars 381 million for heat exchangers 206 million for contracts related to transit authorities and 994 million from acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2006 and second quarter of 2007 offsetting those increases was a decrease of 223 million in our freight segment primarily related to lower industry deliveries of freight cars the company did realize a net sales improvement of 227 million due to foreign exchange but net earnings are mostly not impacted by foreign exchange 

  

net income for 2007 was 1096 million or 223 per diluted share net income for 2006 was 848 million or 173 per diluted share net income improved primarily due to sales increases and higher operating margins 

net sales by segment the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment

gross profit gross profit increased to 3696 million in 2007 compared to 2968 million in 2006 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix in 2007 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 272 compared to 273 in 2006 the gross profit percentage was flat due to the changing mix of revenues from freight to transit as transit margins tend to be lower than freight this was offset by ongoing efficiency and cost saving initiatives in 2007 restructuring plan expenses of 55 million were recorded in cost of sales 2007 gross profit as a percentage of sales excluding these charges would have been 276 in 2006 restructuring plan expenses of 63 million were recorded in cost of sales 2006 gross profit as a percentage of sales excluding these charges would have been 279 

the provision for warranty expense was 180000 less in 2007 compared to 2006 the warranty reserve increased at december 31 2007 compared to december 31 2006 by 49 million due to 47 million from an acquisition completed in the second quarter of 2007 

operating expenses the following table shows our operating expenses

interest expense net interest expense net increased 14 million in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily due to the company’s overall lower cash balances resulting in lower interest income 

other expense net the company recorded foreign exchange expense of 32 million and 11 million respectively in 2007 and 2006 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

  

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 366 and 317 in 2007 and 2006 respectively the increase in effective tax rate is primarily the result of the company’s 2007 adoption of fin 48 as well as the reversal of certain valuation allowances in 2006 approximately 31 million and 53 million of tax benefits were recognized in 2007 and 2006 respectively related to the reversal of deferred tax valuation allowances

net income for 2006 was 848 million or 173 per diluted share net income for 2005 was 558 million or 117 per diluted share as part of a restructuring plan wabtec recognized 68 million pretax in 2006 for restructuring and other charges net income improved primarily due to sales increases improvement in total operating costs as a percentage of sales lower interest expense of 71 million reduced other expense of 17 million and a reduction of the overall effective income tax rate in 2006 to 317 from 356 in 2005 as a result of the reversal of previously established valuation allowances related to deferred state tax assets offsetting these improvements was an increase of about 59 million related to stock based compensation expense 

net sales by segment the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment

the provision for warranty expense was 31 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005 which negatively impacted gross profit part of the increase is due to 18 million of 2005 benefits from the reduction of specific reserves for certain overhaul contracts and transit door components which were deemed to be no longer necessary also specific reserves of 14 million were established in 2006 for bus door components for our north america operations overall our warranty reserve increased at december 31 2006 compared to december 31 2005 by 12 million 

the following table shows our operating expenses 

 

 operating expenses operating expenses increased 89 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 these expenses were 153 of sales for 2006 and 2005 the increase is primarily due to an increase of 59 million in 2006 related to stockbased compensation expense as well as incremental costs associated with higher sales volumes the increase in stockbased compensation expense in 2006 is primarily a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas 123 r in addition 2006 operating expenses included 657000 related to our 2006 acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter 

income from operations income from operations totaled 1302 million or 120 of sales in 2006 compared with 1019 million or 99 of sales in 2005 higher operating income resulted primarily from higher sales and improved operating performance in 2006 

interest expense net interest expense decreased 767 in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the company’s lower debt level during 2006 and higher interest income due to improved cash balances 

other expense net the company recorded a foreign exchange loss of 11 million and 33 million respectively in 2006 and 2005 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 was 317 compared to 356 for the year ended december 31 2005 the lower effective rate in 2006 was primarily related to the reversal of previously established valuation allowances for deferred state tax assets 

net income net income for 2006 increased 290 million compared with 2005 the increase was due to in large part to higher sales and improved gross profit performance as a result of continuing improvements in our manufacturing process 

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under the company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks “credit agreement” the following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data 

 

   

operating activities cash provided by operations in 2007 was 1425 million as compared to 1510 million in 2006 this 85 million decrease was the result of increased earnings offset by certain changes in operating assets and liabilities net income for the company increased 248 million primarily as a result of increased sales and higher operating margins accounts receivable decreased operating cash flows by 772 million due to large customer receivables collected for certain locomotive contracts in 2006 accounts payable provided cash of 401 million due to increased purchases for new businesses accrued liabilities used cash of 93 million as the result of applying customer deposits against customer contract revenue in 2007 other assets and liabilities used cash of 782000 

operating cash flow in 2006 was 1510 million as compared to 843 million in 2005 this 667 million increase was the result of increased earnings as well as certain changes in operating assets and liabilities net income for the company increased 290 million as a result of higher sales volumes and gross profit accounts receivable increased cash flows in 2006 by 992 million primarily as a result of the collection of large milestone payments related to longterm locomotive contracts in 2006 negatively impacting operating cash flows in 2006 is the use of cash of 461 million from accrued liabilities and customer deposits the majority of which relate to the longterm locomotive contracts discussed above also negatively impacting operating cash flows by 93 million is the result of increased inventory as compared to 2005 

investing activities in 2007 and 2006 cash used in investing activities was 935 million and 1048 million respectively in 2007 wabtec acquired 100 of the stock of ricon corporation for 736 million net of cash received in 2006 wabtec acquired 100 of the stock of schaefer equipment and becorit for 363 million and 509 million respectively net of cash received in 2005 wabtec acquired the assets of rutgers rail spa for 359 million net of cash received capital expenditures were 204 million 209 million and 227 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively in 2006 the company sold a noncore division for 14 million

the following table shows outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2007 and 2006 

 

 cash balance at december 31 2007 and 2006 was 2347 million and 1880 million respectively 

refinancing credit agreement in january 2004 the company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “refinancing credit agreement” provided a 175 million fiveyear revolving credit facility expiring in january 2009 in november 2005 the company entered into an amendment to the refinancing credit agreement which among other things extended the expiration of the agreement until december 2010 the company entered into an amendment to its refinancing credit agreement in february 2007 which permits the company to complete any acquisitions without prior approval of the bank consortium as long as certain financial parameters and ratios are met at december 31 2007 the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of 591 million of letters of credit of approximately 1159 million subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 

refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below the company did not borrow under the refinancing credit agreement during 2007 or 2006 

under the refinancing credit agreement the company may elect a base interest rate or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest “libor” the base interest rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 625 to 175 basis points depending on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the current margin is 625 basis points 

the refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the refinancing credit agreement 

  

contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the refinancing credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and “change of control” of the company the refinancing credit agreement includes the following covenants a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3 maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325 and a minimum net worth of 180 million plus 50 of consolidated net income since september 30 2003 the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

6875 senior notes due august 2013 in august 2003 the company issued 150 million of senior notes due in 2013 “the notes” the notes were issued at par interest on the notes accrues at a rate of 6875 per annum and is payable semiannually on january 31 and july 31 of each year the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company’s existing credit agreement and for general corporate purposes the principal balance is due in full at maturity 

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities 

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

effects of inflation 

in general inflation has not had a material impact on the company’s results of operations some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant however higher costs of metals have reduced gross margin other areas of higher costs include medical benefits for active and certain retired employees 

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees the company has grouped these contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements into operating activities financing activities and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information the table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2007 

 

   

  

         the above table does not reflect uncertain tax positions of 172 million the timing of which are uncertain except for 509000 that may become payable during 2008 refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on uncertain tax positions 

obligations for operating activities the company has entered into 533 million of material longterm noncancelable materials and supply purchase obligations operating leases represent multiyear obligations for rental of facilities and equipment estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates expected return on longterm assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates benefits paid for pension obligations were 104 million and 78 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively benefits paid for post retirement plans were 22 million in 2007 and in 2006 

obligations for financing activities cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of longterm debt repayments interest payments and dividend payments to shareholders the company has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders subject to quarterly approval by our board of directors currently at a rate of approximately 19 million annually 

the company arranges for performance bonds to be issued by third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts at december 31 2007 initial value of performance bonds issued on the company’s behalf is about 1051 million 

obligations for investing activities the company typically spends approximately 15 million to 25 million a year for capital expenditures primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization health and safety and environmental control the company expects annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt there was no outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2007 and 2006 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations as of december 31 2007 we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2008 

the company has entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date at the delivery date the company can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis 

at december 31 2006 the company had forward contracts for the sale of us dollars usd and the purchase of canadian dollars cad the company concluded that these foreign currency forward contracts qualify for cash flow hedge accounting which permits the recording of the fair value of the forward contract and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income loss net of tax on the balance sheet as of december 31 2006 the company had forward contracts with a notional value of 48 million cad or 427 million us with an average exchange rate of 089 usd per 1 cad resulting in the recording of a current liability of 13 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 825000 net of tax during 2007 these foreign currency forward contracts were settled 

at december 31 2007 the company had forward contracts for the sale of usd and the purchase of euro with a notional value of €23 million euro or 31 million usd with an average exchange rate of 132 usd per €1 euro these forward contracts are used to mitigate the variability in cash flows from the payment of liabilities denominated in currencies other than the usd since the company does not treat these derivatives as hedges the change in fair value of both the forward contracts and the related liabilities are recorded in the income statement in 2007 the company recorded a fair value gain in the amount of 315000 

  

we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 60 of wabtec’s net sales were to the united states 12 to canada 3 to mexico 3 to australia 2 to germany 11 to the united kingdom and 9 in other international locations see note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31 2006

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and passenger transit rail industries the worldwide market for rail equipment has been estimated at about 70 billion annually our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry many factors influence the industry including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government investment in public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems customers outside of north america accounted for about 22 of wabtec’s sales in 2006 

in north america railroads carry about 42 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods coal is the singlelargest item representing about 40 of carloadings in 2006 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world 

  

governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies these investment programs represent additional opportunities for wabtec to provide products and services 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

 in the us passenger transit is a 32 billion industry dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles new york city is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities offer either rail or bus transit services 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

 business segments and products 

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight group and the transit group the freight group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives builds new switcher locomotives and rebuilds freight locomotives the transit group primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles typically subway cars and buses builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars both business segments serve original equipment manufacturers oems and provide aftermarket sales and services with the aftermarket accounting for over 50 of net sales some business units within the operating groups serve both freight rail and passenger transit rail customers beginning in 2006 the company transferred certain operations between the freight and transit groups to reflect a shift in the markets and customers served by those operations and to 

  

reflect the information used by the chief decision maker in evaluating the operations of the company all priorperiod segment results have been adjusted for this reclassification in 2006 the freight group accounted for 65 of our total net sales and the transit group accounted for the remaining 35 in 2006 the freight group generated 50 of its net sales from the aftermarket and 50 of its net sales from the oems the transit group generated 58 of its net sales from the aftermarket and 42 of its net sales from oems a summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments is outlined below 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 we manufacture sell and service highquality electronics for railroads in the form of onboard systems and braking for locomotives and freight cars we harden our products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments recently we have concentrated our new product development on extending electronic technology to braking equipment and control systems 

we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation our new product development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and controls over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic brakes and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols in early 2007 for example the federal railroad administration fra approved the use of our electronic train management system ®  which offers safety benefits to the rail industry the transit group also focuses on new product development and has introduced a number of new products during the past several years supported by our technical staff of over 500 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers we currently own over 1000 active patents worldwide and 500 us patents during the last three years we have filed for more than 150 us patents in support of our new and evolving product lines

competitive strengths 

our key strengths include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

business strategy 

using the wabtec performance system wps we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies as outlined below through wps we believe we can build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer responsiveness through wps and employeedirected initiatives such as kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product quality and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time we expect these lean initiatives to enable us to increase profit margins which would improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 

  

  

  

 recent acquisitions 

in 2006 wabtec completed two acquisitions in support of its growth strategies in october the company acquired schaefer equipment inc schaefer a leading manufacturer of forged brake rigging components for freight cars for approximately 36 million in cash schaefer based in warren ohio has annual sales of approximately 30 million schaefer manufactures a variety of forged components for bodymounted and truckmounted braking systems in december wabtec acquired becorit gmbh becorit a leading manufacturer of friction products for the european transit railway industry for approximately 51 million in cash based in germany becorit has annual sales of approximately 30 million becorit manufactures a variety of brake shoes pads and friction linings for passenger transit cars freight cars and locomotives and also makes friction products for industrial markets such as mining and wind power generation 

backlog 

in 2006 over 50 of our sales came from aftermarket orders aftermarket orders typically carry lead times of less than 30 days so they are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time as such the company’s backlog is primarily an indicator of future original equipment sales not expected aftermarket activity 

  

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of firm customer orders as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

 

 engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we invested about 327 million 328 million and 338 million respectively on product development and improvement activities approximately 40 of these costs comprise activities solely devoted to new product development in any given year these engineering and development expenditures in total represent about 30 32 and 41 of net sales for the same periods respectively sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years but freight railroads have been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets

we have more than 1000 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of american standard other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we have entered into as licensor and licensee a variety of license agreements we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

  

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

customers 

our customers include railroads throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe south africa and india manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses lessors of such equipment and passenger transit authorities primarily those in north america 

in 2006 about 78 of our sales were to customers in north america but we also shipped products to 108 countries throughout the world over 50 of our sales were in the aftermarket with the rest of our sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

our top five customers electromotive diesel ge transportation systems trinity industries union pacific railroad and bombardier accounted for 26 of our net sales in 2006 no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold about a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a leading market position in north america for most of our other product lines nonetheless we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support our principal competitors vary to some extent across product lines but most competitors are smaller privately held companies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel ge transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace 

employees 

at december 31 2006 we had 5317 fulltime employees approximately 41 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements generally extend through 2007 2008 and 2009 

we consider our relations with our employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar 

  

the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce 

the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes 

as a result of these regulations and those stipulated in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business for the fiscal year ended december 31 2006 our top five customers electromotive diesel ge transportation systems trinity industries union pacific railroad and bombardier accounted for 26 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical industries and as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than us price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a number of cost conscious purchasers has 

  

historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

we intend to pursue future acquisition strategies that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and other business combinations that we believe will improve our market position and realize operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings acquisitions joint ventures and other business combinations involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate synergistic and strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the level of use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales has been and we expect that a material 

  

portion of our future net sales may be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally including as a result of terrorist activities and the military response by the united states and other countries could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2006 22 of our consolidated net sales were derived from sales outside of north america and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia canada china france germany india italy mexico and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

claims have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products since 2000 the number of such claims has increased and the resolution of these claims may take a significant period of 

  

time most of these claims have been made against our wholly owned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc prior to the time that the company acquired any interest in rfpc on april 17 2005 a claim against the company by a former stockholder of rfpc contending that the company assumed that entity’s liability for asbestos claims arising from exposure to rfpc’s product was resolved in the company’s favor 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

it is management’s belief that the potential range of loss for asbestosrelated bodily injury cases is not reasonably determinable at present for a variety of factors including 1 the limited asbestos case settlement history of the company’s wholly owned subsidiary rfpc 2 the unpredictable nature of personal injury litigation in general and 3 the uncertainty of asbestos litigation in particular despite this uncertainty and although the results of the company’s operations and cash flows for any given period could be adversely affected by asbestosrelated lawsuits management believes that the final resolution of the company’s asbestosrelated cases will not be material to the company’s overall financial position results of operations and cash flows in general this belief is based upon 1 wabtec’s and rfpc’s limited history of settlements and dismissals of asbestosrelated cases to date 2 the inability of many plaintiffs to establish any exposure or causal relationship to rfpc’s product and 3 the inability of many plaintiffs to demonstrate any identifiable injury or compensable loss 

more specifically as to rfpc management’s belief that any losses due to asbestosrelated cases would not be material is also based on the fact that rfpc owns insurance which provides coverage for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims to date rfpc’s insurers have provided rfpc with defense and indemnity in these actions as to wabtec and its divisions management’s belief that asbestosrelated cases will not have a material impact is also based on its position that it has no legal liability for asbestosrelated bodily injury claims and that the former owners of wabtec’s assets retained asbestos liabilities for the products at issue to date wabtec has been able to successfully defend itself on this basis including two arbitration decisions and a judicial opinion all of which confirmed wabtec’s position that it did not assume any asbestos liabilities from the former owners of certain wabtec assets although wabtec has incurred defense and administrative costs in connection with asbestos bodily injury actions these costs have not been material and the company has no information that would suggest these costs would become material in the foreseeable future 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

our manufacturer’s warranties or product liability may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently 

  

maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure you that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 41 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through 2007 2008 and 2009 failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure you that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2006 we have total debt of 150 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the refinancing credit agreement along with carrying the 150 million 6 78 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

 the indenture for our 150 million 6 78 senior notes due 2013 and our refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

  

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

the integration of our recently completed acquisitions may not result in anticipated improvements in market position or the realization of anticipated operating synergies or may take longer to realize than expected 

in the fourth quarter of 2006 we completed the acquisition of 100 of the stock of schaefer and becorit for a combined 872 million net of cash received although we believe that the acquisitions will improve our market position and realize positive operating results including operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings we cannot be assured that these improvements will be obtained the management and acquisition of businesses involves substantial risks any of which may result in a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles as well as in more than 100 countries throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles wabtec is a global company with operations in 11 countries in 2006 about 34 of the company’s revenues came from outside the us and about 22 came from outside of north america 

management review and outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy including global and market expansion new products and technologies aftermarket products and services and acquisitions in addition management monitors the company’s shortterm operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

freight rail industry statistics such as carloadings and orders for new freight cars increased in 2006 based on preliminary figures deliveries of new freight cars increased 9 and orders increased 14 compared to the same period in 2005 as a result at december 31 2006 the backlog of freight cars ordered was 85826 sales in our freight segment have benefited from that trend following are quarterly freight car statistics for the past three years 

 

 source railway supply institute and management estimates  figures that do not roll forward period to period reflect minor adjustments subsequent to that period from figures reported by the railway supply institute 

  

carloadings and intermodal units originated have increased over the past three years reflecting higher rail traffic and ultimately better opportunities for maintenance and aftermarket sales for the company 

carloadings originated in thousands 

 

 intermodal units originated in thousands 

 

 source association of american railroads—weekly rail traffic 

deliveries of transit cars were 738 and 918 for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively deliveries of locomotives were 1244 and 1106 for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

in 2007 the company expects conditions to remain generally favorable in its freight rail and passenger transit rail markets demand for new locomotives is expected to be slightly higher than in 2006 while demand for new freight cars is expected to be slightly lower rail traffic volumes which set a record in 2006 started off slightly lower in january 2007 due in part to weather conditions in the passenger transit rail market the company believes that increases in ridership and federal funding will continue to have a positive effect on the demand for new equipment and aftermarket parts in addition the company has a strong backlog of transitrelated projects some of which are expected to generate increased revenues in 2007 

in 2007 and beyond we will continue to face many challenges including increased costs for raw materials higher costs for medical and insurance premiums and foreign currency fluctuations in addition we face general economic risks as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

on july 19 2006 the board of directors approved a restructuring plan to improve the profitability and efficiency of certain business units as part of the plan wabtec downsized two of its canadian plants in stoney creek and wallaceburg by moving certain products to lowercost facilities and outsourcing wabtec recorded expenses of 68 million pretax in 2006 for restructuring and other expenses as a result of the approval of this plan these expenses were comprised of the following components 12 million for employee severance costs associated with approximately 240 salaried and hourly employees located at our wallaceburg and stoney creek locations 22 million of pension curtailment for those employees 29 million related to asset impairments for structures machinery and equipment and 541000 for goodwill impairment specific to the wallaceburg facility as of december 31 2006 the employees associated with the restructuring program had been terminated and none of the severance had been paid severance costs are contractual liabilities and payment is dependent on the waiver by or expiration of certain seniority rights of those employees 

the restructuring plan will result in additional charges in 2007 primarily for pensionrelated settlement charges pension funding will be subject to regulatory review and approval and funding is anticipated to be made in 2007 

  

results of operations 

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 

 

 2006 compared to 2005 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales increased by 536 million to 10876 million in 2006 from 10340 million in 2005 the increase is primarily related to increased sales from our services radiator and electronics business units of about 41 million increased sales from contracts to build locomotives of about 27 million increased revenues of about 22 million related to higher industry freight car deliveries incremental sales related to acquisitions consummated in the fourth quarter of about 10 million and increased transit sales of about 6 million as a result of increased spending by transit authorities these increases were partially offset by volume decreases of about 30 million due to lower industry sales of intermodal cars and about 21 million for certain uk operations primarily related to overhaul contracts the company did not realize any significant net sales improvement because of price increases or foreign exchange 

net income for 2006 was 848 million or 173 per diluted share net income for 2005 was 558 million or 117 per diluted share as part of a restructuring plan wabtec recognized 68 million pretax in 2006 for restructuring and other charges net income improved primarily due to sales increases improvement in total operating costs as a percentage of sales lower interest expense of 71 million reduced other expense of 17 million and a reduction of the overall effective income tax rate in 2006 to 317 from 356 in 2005 as a result of the reversal of previously established valuation allowances related to deferred state tax assets offsetting these improvements was an increase of about 59 million related to stock based compensation expense 

  

net sales by segment beginning in 2006 the company transferred certain operations between the freight and transit groups to reflect a shift in the markets and customers served by those operations prior period results have been adjusted for comparability purposes the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

 

 industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2006 increased to 74943 units as compared to 68657 in 2005 transit group sales were higher due to increased commuter locomotive revenues 

gross profit gross profit increased to 2968 million in 2006 compared to 2596 million in 2005 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix in 2006 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 27 compared to 25 in 2005 the restructuring plan charges impacted gross margin with 63 million being recorded in cost of sales in addition specific reserves for transit related excess and obsolete inventory of 36 million were also recorded in cost of sales in 2006 gross profit improvement is due to a variety of factors including improved performance of a locomotive module contract which was profitable in 2006 compared to a loss in the prior year the remaining improvement is due to cost savings realized from sourcing raw materials from lower cost suppliers reduced labor costs and continuing improvements in our manufacturing processes 

the provision for warranty expense was 31 million higher in 2006 compared to 2005 which negatively impacted gross profit part of the increase is due to 18 million of reductions in 2005 of specific reserves related to certain overhaul contracts and transit door components that we established in 2004 which were deemed to be no longer necessary also specific reserves of 14 million were established in 2006 for bus door components for our north america operations overall our warranty reserve increased at december 31 2006 compared to december 31 2005 by 12 million 

the following table shows our operating expenses 

 

 operating expenses operating expenses increased 88 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 these expenses were 154 and 153 of sales for 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase is primarily due to an increase of 59 million in 2006 related to stockbased compensation expense as well as incremental costs associated with higher sales volumes the increase in stockbased compensation expense in 2006 is primarily a result of 25 million of expense related to nonvested restricted stock granted in 2006 incremental expense of 18 million related to incentive stock awards and 13 million of expense incurred for stock options as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas 123 r in addition 2006 operating expenses included 657000 related to our 2006 acquisitions that occurred in the fourth quarter 

  

income from operations income from operations totaled 1296 million or 119 of sales in 2006 compared with 1013 million or 98 of sales in 2005 higher operating income resulted primarily from higher sales and improved operating performance in 2006 

interest expense net interest expense decreased 817 in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the company’s lower debt level during 2006 and higher interest income due to improved cash balances 

other expense net the company recorded a foreign exchange loss of 11 million and 33 million respectively in 2006 and 2005 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended december 31 2006 was 317 compared to 356 for the year ended december 31 2005 the lower effective rate in 2006 was primarily related to the reversal of previously established valuation allowances for deferred state tax assets 

net income net income for 2006 increased 290 million compared with 2005 the increase was due to in large part to higher sales and improved gross profit performance as a result of continuing improvements in our manufacturing process 

2005 compared to 2004 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales increased by 212 million from 822 million in 2004 to 1034 million in 2005 primarily as a result of volume increases of about 85 million related to increasing freight car deliveries and strong demand for locomotive components the acquisition of the friction product assets of rutgers rail spa “cofren” resulting in additional sales of 25 million and incremental sales of 48 million from the rampup of a locomotive module contract in 2005 aftermarket parts sales also increased by 53 million because of strong carloadings and intermodal units originated the company did not realize any significant net sales improvement because of price increases or foreign exchange net income for 2005 was 558 million or 117 per diluted share net income for 2004 was 324 million or 071 per diluted share this increase in net income was primarily due to increased sales 

net sales by segment beginning in 2006 the company transferred certain operations from the freight to the transit group to reflect a shift in the markets and customers served by those operations prior period results have been adjusted for comparability purposes the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

 

   

industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2005 increased to 68657 units as compared to 46292 in 2004 transit group sales were slightly higher mostly due to increased oem demand 

gross profit gross profit increased to 2596 million in 2005 compared to 2052 million in 2004 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix the increase in gross profit is primarily due to increased sales related to both aftermarket sales increases and volume increases in freight car deliveries with gross profit of 41 million the cofren acquisition in the first quarter of 2005 and decreased warranty expense of 7 million these positive factors were offset by reduced gross profit from the rampup of a locomotive modules contract of 2 million and certain discrete restructuring costs of 31 million in 2005 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 25 compared to 25 in 2004 

the provision for warranty expense was 71 million lower than the prioryear which positively impacted gross profit the most significant reason for the reduction is due to nonrecurring specific reserves established in 2004 for canadian transit door contracts and certain electronic products overall our warranty reserve decreased in 2005 by 13 million as claims were paid related to the 2004 specific reserves discussed above 

the following table shows our operating expenses 

 

 operating expenses operating expenses increased 86 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 operating expenses are higher in 2005 due to the addition of cofren a 1 million reserve for a note receivable that is considered uncollectible and overall higher costs from inflation and sales activity of about 4 million the year ended december 31 2004 included a 32 million unfavorable litigation ruling in to getsgs which was settled in 2006 as a percentage of sales total operating expense declined to 153 in 2005 from 182  in 2004 due to the company keeping operating expenses relatively consistent in 2005 when sales increased 26 

income from operations income from operations totaled 1013 million or 98 of sales in 2005 compared with 554 million or 67 of sales in 2004 higher operating income resulted primarily from higher sales in 2005 

interest expense net interest expense decreased 247 in 2005 as compared 2004 primarily due to the company’s lower debt level during 2005 and higher interest income 

other expense net the company recorded a foreign exchange loss of 33 million and 12 million respectively in 2005 and 2004 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 356 for 2005 in 2004 wabtec recorded a 49 million tax benefit after resolving certain tax issues from prior years without this benefit the overall effective income tax rate was 365 for 2004 the 2005 rate was lower due to increased income in lower tax jurisdictions 

net income net income for 2005 increased 233 million compared with 2004 the increase was due to higher sales 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under the company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks “credit agreement” the following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data 

 

 operating activities operating cash flow in 2006 was 1510 million as compared to 843 million in 2005 this 667 million increase was the result of increased earnings as well as certain changes in operating assets and liabilities net income for the company increased 290 million as a result of higher sales volumes and gross profit accounts receivable increased cash flows in 2006 by 992 million primarily as a result of the collection of large milestone payments related to longterm locomotive contracts in 2006 negatively impacting operating cash flows in 2006 is the use of cash of 461 million from accrued liabilities and customer deposits the majority of which relate to the longterm locomotive contracts discussed above also negatively impacting operating cash flows by 93 million is the result of increased inventory as compared to 2005 

operating cash flow in 2005 was 843 million as compared to 535 million in 2004 this 308 million increase was the result of increased earnings as well as certain changes in operating assets and liabilities net income for the company increased 234 million primarily as a result of the higher sales volume for 2005 accrued income taxes increased operating cash flows by 16 million in 2005 due to the timing of tax payments in 2004 in particular tax liabilities recognized in 2003 were liquidated in 2004 accrued liabilities and customer deposits generated operating cash flows of 366 million more than the prior year in particular customer deposits from certain locomotive contracts accounted for the majority of this increase net other assets and liabilities generated approximately 139 million in cash related to increasing liability balances related to pensions post retirement healthcare and long term incentive plan liabilities negatively impacting operating cash flows were accounts receivable which used operating cash of 388 million and accounts payable decreased using cash of approximately 208 million accounts receivable had increased as a result of the correspondingly higher sales for 2005 accounts payable decreased as the company reduced trade payables 

investing activities in 2006 and 2005 cash used in investing activities was 1048 million and 576 million respectively in 2006 we acquired 100 of the stock of schaefer equipment and becorit for 363 million and 509 million respectively net of cash received the remaining use of cash consisted almost entirely of capital expenditures net of disposals in 2005 we acquired the assets of rutgers rail spa for 359 million net of cash received the remaining use of cash consisted almost entirely of capital expenditures net of disposals 

capital expenditures for continuing operations were 209 million 227 million and 193 million in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the majority of capital expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to and replacement of existing equipment 

financing activities in 2006 cash used by financing activities was 18 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of 278 million in 2005 the decrease relates to reduced proceeds received related to stock option exercises in 2006 as a result of an overall decrease in options exercised in 2006 as compared to 

  

2005 also on july 31 2006 the company’s board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to 50 million of the company’s outstanding shares through december 31 2006 the company had repurchased 673900 shares for an aggregate cost of 189 million 

the company realized proceeds of 146 million and 298 million from the exercise of stock options during 2006 and 2005 respectively during 2004 long term debt was reduced by 401 million the company also realized proceeds of 228 million from the exercise of stock options during 2004 

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities 

the following table shows outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2006 and 2005 the revolving credit agreement and other term loan interest rates are variable and dependent on market conditions 

 

 cash balance at december 31 2006 and 2005 was 1880 million and 1414 million respectively 

refinancing credit agreement in january 2004 the company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “refinancing credit agreement” provided a 175 million fiveyear revolving credit facility expiring in january 2009 in november 2005 the company entered into an amendment to the refinancing credit agreement which among other things extended the expiration of the agreement until december 2010 at december 31 2006 the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of 239 million of letters of credit of approximately 1511million subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 

refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below the company did not borrow under the refinancing credit agreement during the year ended december 31 2006 

under the refinancing credit agreement we may elect a base interest rate or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest “libor” the base interest rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 625 to 175 basis points depending on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the current margin is 625 basis points 

the refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

  

the refinancing credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and “change of control” of the company the refinancing credit agreement includes the following covenants a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3 maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325 and a minimum net worth of 180 million plus 50 of consolidated net income since september 30 2003 the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

the company entered into an amendment to its refinancing credit agreement in february 2007 prior to the amendment the refinancing credit agreement prohibited the company from making acquisitions past a certain dollar limit without the prior approval of the bank consortium the refinancing credit agreement now permits the company to complete acquisitions as long as certain financial parameters and ratios are met 

effects of inflation 

in general inflation has not had a material impact on the company’s results of operations some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant however higher costs of metals have reduced gross margin other areas of higher costs include medical benefits for active and retired employees 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees the company has grouped these contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements into operating activities financing activities and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information the table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2006

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt there was no outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2006 and 2005 management had entered into payfixed receivevariable interest rate swap contracts that mitigated the impact of variablerate debt interest rate increases these interest rate swap contracts were terminated in 2004 in 2003 we had concluded that our swap contracts qualified for “special cash flow hedge accounting” which permitted recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations as of december 31 2006 we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2007 

we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis all outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of us dollars usd and the purchase of canadian dollars cad as of december 31 2006 we had forward contracts with a notional value of 48 million cad or 427 million us with an average exchange rate of 089 usd per 1 cad resulting in the recording of a current liability of 13 million and a corresponding offset in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 825000 net of tax 

we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 66 of wabtec’s net sales are in the united states 10 in canada 2 in mexico 4 in australia 1 in germany 9 in the united kingdom and 8 in other international locations see note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

recent accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 fin 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize measure present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return fin 48 is effective in the first quarter of 2007 the cumulative effects if any of applying this interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption the company is currently evaluating the impact of this statement on its financial statements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas 158 sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income this company has adopted the provisions of sfas 158 as of december 31 2006 the provisions of sfas 158 are to be applied on a prospective basis therefore prior 

  

periods presented have not been restated the adoption in 2006 had no effect on the computation of net periodic benefit expense for pensions and postretirement benefits see note 10 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for the impact of the adoption on the company’s consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2006

effective january 1 2006 wabtec adopted sfas 123 r which requires the company to recognize compensation expense for stockbased compensation based on the grant date fair value this expense must be recognized ratably over the requisite service period following the date of grant wabtec has elected the modified prospective transition method for adoption and prior periods financial statements have not been restated prior to january 1 2006 wabtec accounted for stockbased compensation in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 25 apb 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations as a result of the adoption stockbased compensation expense for 2006 includes 13 million of expense related to stock options that previously was not recognized under apb 25

 item 1 business tableend general 

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries originally founded by george westinghouse in 1869 westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc asi in 1999 wabco merged with motivepower industries inc “motivepower” and adopted the name wabtec 

today wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold about a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a no 1 or 2 positions in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and subway cars in 2005 the company had sales of 1 billion and net income of 56 million sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 50 of total sales in 2005 

management and insiders of the company own approximately 6 of wabtec’s outstanding shares with the balance held by investment companies and individuals executive management incentive compensation focuses on earnings cash flow working capital and economic profit targets to align management interests with those of outside shareholders 

industry overview 

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and passenger transit rail industries the worldwide market for rail equipment has been estimated at about 70 billion annually and it is estimated to grow at about 4 annually for the next five years our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry many factors influence the industry including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government investment in public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems customers outside of north america accounted for about 24 of wabtec’s sales in 2005 

in north america railroads carry about 42 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities and goods coal is the singlelargest item representing about 40 of carloadings in 2005 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the 

  

rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies these investment programs represent additional opportunities for wabtec to provide products and services 

demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

  

 in the us passenger transit is a 32 billion industry dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles new york city is the largest passenger transit market in the us but most major cities offer either rail or bus transit services 

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

 

  

 business segments and products

team concept we continuously strive to improve quality delivery and productivity and to reduce costs these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product quality and customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments over time we expect these lean initiatives to enable us to increase profit margins which would improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies 

 

  

  

  

 backlog 

in 2005 50 of our sales came from aftermarket orders aftermarket orders typically carry lead times of less than 30 days so they are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time as such the company’s backlog is primarily an indicator of future original equipment sales not expected aftermarket activity 

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

the backlog of customer orders as of december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

 

   

at december 31 2005 the company’s backlog including customer option orders exceeded 1 billion 

engineering and development 

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 we invested about 328 million 338 million and 329 million respectively on product development and improvement activities approximately 40 of these costs comprise activities solely devoted to new product development in any given year these engineering and development expenditures in total represent about 32 41 and 46 of net sales for the same periods respectively sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for a long time but freight railroads have been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads 

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

intellectual property 

we have more than 1000 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of american standard other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program 

we are a party as licensor and licensee to a variety of license agreements we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

we entered into a license agreement with faiveley transport formerly sab wabco holdings bv on december 31 1993 pursuant to which faiveley transport granted us a license to the intellectual property and knowhow related to the manufacturing and marketing of certain disc brakes tread brakes and low noise and resilient wheel products sab wabco holdings bv was a former affiliate of wabtec since both were owned by the same parent company in the early 1990s the faiveley transport license expired december 31 2005 and was not renewed the company does not believe the expiration of this license will have a material impact on its results of operations 

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabtesco and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

  

customers 

our customers include railroads throughout north america as well as in the united kingdom australia europe south africa and india manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses lessors of such equipment and passenger transit authorities primarily those in north america 

in 2005 about 76 of our sales were to customers in north america but we also shipped products to 89 countries throughout the world about 50 of our sales were in the aftermarket with the rest of our sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

our top five customers electromotive diesel general electric transportation systems burlington northern santa fe bombardier and national steel car accounted for 24 of our net sales in 2005 no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

competition 

we believe that we hold about a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a no 1 or no 2 market positions in north america for most of our other product lines nonetheless we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support our principal competitors vary to some extent across product lines but most competitors are smaller privately held companies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations electromotive diesel general electric transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace 

employees 

at december 31 2005 we had 5229 fulltime employees approximately 41 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements generally extend through late 2006 2007 and 2009 

we consider our relations with our employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

regulation 

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar 

the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce 

the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies 

  

railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes 

as a result of these regulations and regulations in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

effects of seasonality 

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period 

environmental matters 

information on environmental matters is included in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

 item 1a risk factors tableend we are dependent upon key customers 

we rely on several key customers who represent a significant portion of our business for the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 our top five customers electromotive diesel general electric transportation systems burlington northern santa fe bombardier and national steel car accounted for 24 of our net sales while we believe our relationships with our customers are generally good our top customers could choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us in addition many of our customers place orders for products on an as needed basis and operate in cyclical industries and as a result their order levels have varied from period to period in the past and may vary significantly in the future such customer orders are dependent upon their markets and customers and may be subject to delays and cancellations as a result of our dependence on our key customers we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition if we lost any one or more of our key customers or if there is a reduction in their demand for our products 

our business operates in a highly competitive industry 

we operate in a competitive marketplace and face substantial competition from a limited number of established competitors in the united states and abroad some of which may have greater financial resources than us price competition is strong and coupled with the existence of a limited number of cost conscious purchasers has historically limited our ability to increase prices in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support there can be no assurance that competition in one or more of our markets will not adversely affect us and our results of operations 

  

we intend to pursue future acquisition strategies that involve a number of inherent risks any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits 

one aspect of our business strategy is to selectively pursue acquisitions joint ventures and other business combinations that we believe will improve our market position and realize operating synergies operating expense reductions and overhead cost savings acquisitions joint ventures and other business combinations involve inherent risks and uncertainties any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations including 

 

  

  

  

 we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions joint ventures or other business combinations if we are unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to consummate synergistic and strategic acquisitions we may be unable to fully implement our business strategy and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected as a result in addition our ability to engage in strategic acquisitions will be dependent on our ability to raise substantial capital and we may not be able to raise the funds necessary to implement our acquisition strategy on terms satisfactory to us if at all 

as we introduce new products and services a failure to predict and react to consumer demand could adversely affect our business 

we have dedicated significant resources to the development manufacturing and marketing of new products decisions to develop and market new transportation products are typically made without firm indications of customer acceptance moreover by their nature new products may require alteration of existing business methods or threaten to displace existing equipment in which our customers may have a substantial capital investment there can be no assurance that any new products that we develop will gain widespread acceptance in the marketplace or that such products will be able to compete successfully with other new products or services that may be introduced by competitors 

our revenues are subject to cyclical variations in the railway and passenger transit markets and changes in government spending 

the railway industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations due to overall economic conditions the level of use of alternate methods of transportation and the levels of federal state and local government spending on railroad transit projects in economic downturns railroads have deferred and may defer certain expenditures in order to conserve cash in the short term reductions in freight traffic may reduce demand for our replacement products 

the passenger transit railroad industry is also cyclical new passenger transit car orders vary from year to year and are influenced greatly by major replacement programs and by the construction or expansion of transit systems by transit authorities a substantial portion of our net sales has been and we expect that a material portion of our future net sales may be derived from contracts with metropolitan transit and commuter rail authorities and amtrak to the extent that future funding for proposed public projects is curtailed or withdrawn altogether as a result of changes in political economic fiscal or other conditions beyond our control such projects may be delayed or cancelled resulting in a potential loss of business for us including transit aftermarket and new transit car orders there can be no assurance that economic conditions will be favorable or that there will not be significant fluctuations adversely affecting the industry as a whole and as a result us 

  

prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business 

unfavorable general economic and market conditions in the united states and internationally including as a result of terrorist activities and the military response by the united states and other countries could have a negative impact on our sales and operations to the extent that these factors result in continued instability of capital markets shortages of raw materials or component parts longer sales cycles deferral or delay of customer orders or an inability to market our products effectively our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

a growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level 

in fiscal year 2005 24 of our consolidated net sales were derived from sales outside of north america and we intend to continue to expand our international operations in the future we currently conduct our international operations through a variety of wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries and joint ventures in australia canada china france india italy mexico and the united kingdom as a result we are subject to various risks any one of which could have a material adverse effect on those operations and on our business as a whole including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition certain jurisdictions have laws that limit the ability of nonus subsidiaries and their affiliates to pay dividends and repatriate cash flows 

we may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to increases in interest rates that may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt and changes in foreign currency exchange rates we may seek to minimize these risks through the use of interest rate swap contracts and currency hedging agreements there can be no assurance that any of these measures will be effective any material changes in interest or exchange rates could result in material losses to us 

we may have liability arising from asbestos litigation 

actions have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products since 2000 the number of such claims has increased most of these claims have been made against our whollyowned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc before we acquired american standard inc’s asi 50 interest in rfpc in 1990 we acquired the remaining interest in rfpc in 1992 these claims include a suit against rfpc and its insurers seeking coverage under rfpc’s insurance policies on april 17 2005 the claim against the company contending that the company assumed asi’s liability for asbestos claims arising from exposure to rfpc’s products was resolved in the company’s favor 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with other pending litigation cannot be estimated 

  

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances we believe our operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

our manufacturer’s warranties may expose us to potentially significant claims 

we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products accordingly we are subject to a risk of product liability or warranty claims in the event that the failure of any of our products results in personal injury or death or does not conform to our customers’ specifications in addition in recent years we have introduced a number of new products for which we do not have the same level of historical warranty experience although we have not had any material product liability or warranty claims made against us and we currently maintain liability insurance coverage we cannot assure you that product liability claims if made would not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that insurance will continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms if at all the possibility exists for these types of warranty claims to result in costly product recalls significant repair costs and damage to our reputation 

labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we collectively bargain with labor unions that represent approximately 41 of our employees our current collective bargaining agreements generally extend through late 2006 2007 and 2009 failure to reach an agreement could result in strikes or other labor protests which could disrupt our operations if we were to experience a strike or work stoppage it would be difficult for us to find a sufficient number of employees with the necessary skills to replace these employees we cannot assure you that we will reach any such agreement or that we will not encounter strikes or other types of conflicts with the labor unions of our personnel such labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations could cause us to lose revenues and customers and might have permanent effects on our business 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers 

from time to time we are engaged in contractual disputes with our customers regarding routine delivery and performance issues as well as adjustments for design changes and related extra work these disputes are generally resolved in the ordinary course of business without having a material adverse impact on us 

our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health 

at december 31 2005 we have total debt of 150 million if it becomes necessary to access our available borrowing capacity under the refinancing credit agreement along with carrying the 150 million 6 78 senior notes being indebted could have important consequences to us for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

   

the indenture for our 150 million 6 78 senior notes due 2013 and our refinancing credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion in the operation of our businesses 

the indenture governing the notes and our credit agreement contain various covenants that limit our management’s discretion 

the refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the indenture under which the senior notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all locomotives freight cars subway cars and buses in the us as well as in certain markets throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles 

wabtec is a global company with operations in 11 countries in 2005 about 76 percent of the company’s revenues came from its north american operations and wabtec also sold products or services in 89 countries around the world 

management review of 2005 and future outlook 

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy in addition management monitors the company’s shortterm operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

in 2005 we achieved the following 

 

  

  

 we achieved these results despite higher raw material costs and despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates especially on the company’s canadian operations 

  

freight rail industry statistics such as carloadings and orders for new freight cars improved in 2005 for example carloadings increased to a record 172 million 09 higher than 2004 as the freight railroads benefited from the strengthening economy in the us as shown below deliveries of new freight cars increased to 68657 in 2005 and orders increased to 80703 as a result at yearend the backlog of freight cars ordered was 69408 its highest level since 1998 sales in our freight segment have benefited from that trend following are quarterly freight car statistics for the past three years 

 

 source railway supply institute 

the following is a summary of freight car locomotive and transit car deliveries for the industry 

 

   

source railway supply institute and company estimates 

carloadings and intermodal units originated have increased over the past three years reflecting higher rail traffic and ultimately better opportunities for maintenance and aftermarket sales for the company 

 

 source association of american railroads—weekly rail traffic 

in 2006 we expect demand for locomotives freight cars and transit vehicles to remain at about the same levels as 2005 we expect demand in the aftermarket to remain strong due to continued growth in rail traffic and passenger transit ridership 

in 2006 and beyond we will continue to face many challenges including increased costs for raw materials especially steel higher costs for medical and insurance premiums and foreign currency fluctuations in addition we face general economic risks as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

the company continues to evaluate possible restructuring actions that if taken would be expected to result in ongoing benefits but would require significant onetime charges against income 

  

results of operations 

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 

 

 2005 compared to 2004 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales increased by 212 million from 822 million in 2004 to 1034 million in 2005 primarily as a result of volume increases in freight car deliveries strong demand for locomotive components the acquisition of the friction product assets of rutgers rail spa “cofren” and the rampup of a locomotive module contract in 2005 aftermarket parts sales also increased because of strong carloadings and intermodal units originated the company did not realize any significant net sales improvement because of price increases or foreign exchange net income for 2005 was 558 million or 117 per diluted share net income for 2004 was 324 million or 071 per diluted share this increase in net income was primarily due to increased sales 

the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

 

   

net sales net sales for 2005 increased 212 million or 258 as compared to 2004 the freight group’s increased sales reflected higher sales of certain components to international markets higher demand for pneumatic air brake components related to increased deliveries of freight cars sales of about 25 million from the cofren acquisition in the first quarter of 2005 and sales from a locomotive module contract industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2005 increased to 68657 units as compared to 46292 in 2004 transit group sales were slightly higher mostly due to increased oem demand 

gross profit gross profit increased to 2596 million in 2005 compared to 2052 million in 2004 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix in 2005 gross profit as a percentage of sales was 25 compared to 25 in 2004 the increase in gross profit percentage is primarily due to increased sales and the company’s costimprovement programs the company is taking action to improve margins in future quarters including price increases and ongoing initiatives to increase productivity and efficiency 

the company recorded a loss provision of 16 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to a contract to assemble locomotive modules in our boise idaho facility this provision was based upon customer purchase orders for units expected to be unprofitable and other specific contract costs during the third quarter of 2005 as a result of the termination of the contract and improvements in cost the entire reserve was reversed to earnings however as a result of the termination of agreement the company charged to expense 12 million of preproduction costs originally capitalized in 2004 which was being amortized along with delivery of the modules contract and 161000 of other costs this contract termination potentially reduces the number of locomotive modules the company may supply to the customer but has allowed for price increases on current and future orders other issues reducing gross profit percentage include severance and relocation costs of 19 million related to the consolidation of several production facilities and the writedown of fixed assets of 1 million from the closure of certain foundry operations 

the provision for warranty expense was 71 million lower than the prioryear which positively impacted gross profit the provision for warranty expense is lower due to improved warranty performance at three business units and lower charges for certain specific products overall our warranty reserve decreased in 2005 by 13 million as warranty claims paid were more than warranty expense 

the following table shows our operating expenses 

 

 operating expenses operating expenses increased 86 million in 2005 as compared to 2004 operating expenses are higher in 2005 due to the addition of cofren a 1 million reserve for a note receivable that is considered uncollectible and overall higher costs from inflation and sales activity 2004 included a 32 million unfavorable litigation ruling to getsgs which the company disagrees with and intends to contest as a percentage of sales total operating expense declined to 153 in 2005 from 182  in 2004 

income from operations income from operations totaled 1013 million or 98 of sales in 2005 compared with 554 million or 67 of sales in 2004 higher operating income resulted primarily from higher sales in 2005 

interest expense net interest expense decreased 247 in 2005 as compared 2004 primarily due to the company’s lower debt level during 2005 and higher interest income 

  

other expense net the company recorded a foreign exchange loss of 33 million and 12 million respectively in 2005 and 2004 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 356 for 2005 in 2004 wabtec recorded a 49 million tax benefit after resolving certain tax issues from prior years without this benefit the overall effective income tax rate was 365 for 2004 the 2005 rate was lower due to increased income in lower tax jurisdictions 

net income net income for 2005 increased 233 million compared with 2004 the increase was due to higher sales 

2004 compared to 2003 

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

 

 net sales increased by 145 from 7179 million in 2003 to 822 million in 2004 primarily as a result of volume increases in freight car locomotive and transit car deliveries aftermarket part sales increased because of carloadings and intermodal units originated the company did not realize any significant net sales improvement because of price increases or foreign exchange net income for 2004 was 324 million or 071 per diluted share net income for 2003 was 227 million or 052 per diluted share this increase in net income was primarily due to increased sales and a favorable tax benefit 

the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

 

 net sales net sales for 2004 increased 1041 million or 145 as compared to 2003 the freight group’s increased sales reflected higher sales of certain components to international markets higher demand for pneumatic air brake components related to increased delivery of freight cars and locomotives and greater demand for friction products due to overall increased rail traffic in 2004 industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2004 increased to 46292 units as compared to 31400 in 2003 the transit group’s increased sales were due to increased deliveries under existing contracts and higher aftermarket sales 

gross profit gross profit increased to 2052 million in 2004 compared to 1895 million in 2003 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix gross profit as a percentage of sales was 25 compared to 264 in 2003 the decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due to increased manufacturing costs because of higher raw material prices higher medical costs for retiree health plans and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates on the company’s canadian operations other issues reducing gross profit percentage include inefficiencies relating to the closing and relocation of an 

  

electronics plant from canada to the us the establishment of a 970000 reserve to reflect future environmental monitoring at our boise facility fixed asset impairment charges of 13 million and the start up of lowmargin rail door contracts in the transit group also the provision for warranty expense increased 44 million in 2004 compared to 2003 the provision for warranty expense was higher due to a combination of higher sales requiring additional reserves and charges for certain specific products although the warranty provision increased in 2004 warranty claims decreased resulting in an overall increase of 41 million in our warranty reserves the company is taking action to improve margins in future quarters including price increases and ongoing initiatives to increase productivity and efficiency 

the following table shows our operating expenses 

 

 operating expenses operating expenses increased 101 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 including a 32 million unfavorable litigation ruling to getsgs which the company disagrees with and intends to contest other costs comprising the increase include restructuring costs at the company’s electronics unit higher medical and insurance claims experience foreign exchange costs and overall higher costs from inflation and sales activity these increases were partially offset by reduced amortization expense amortization expense decreased due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized 

income from operations  income from operations totaled 554 million or 67 of sales in 2004 compared with 498 million or 69 of sales in 2003 higher operating income resulted from increased sales in 2004 partially offset by higher operating expenses 

interest expense net interest expense increased 37 in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the company’s sale of senior notes in august 2003 these notes while resulting in higher interest expense for 2004 enabled the company to convert shortterm variablerate debt into fixedrate debt at an attractive longterm interest rate 

other expense net the company incurred foreign exchange losses of 12 million and 28 million respectively in 2004 and 2003 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

income taxes income tax expense in 2004 includes a tax benefit of 49 million primarily related to the reversal of certain items that had previously been provided for that were closed from further regulatory examination the effective income tax rate not including the aforementioned tax benefit remains unchanged and was 365 for 2004 and 2003 

net income  net income for 2004 increased 97 million compared with 2003 the increase was due to higher sales and the tax benefit mentioned above partially offset by other items including the unfavorable getsgs litigation ruling increased environmental reserve and higher manufacturing costs 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under the company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks “credit agreement” the following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data 

 

 management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity the following is a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities 

 

 ebitda is defined as earnings before deducting interest expense income taxes and depreciation and amortization although ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles management believes that it is useful to an investor in evaluating wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a company’s operating performance and ability to service debt financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on ebitda ebitda does not purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in addition because ebitda is not calculated identically by all companies the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies management’s discretionary use of funds depicted by ebitda may be limited by working capital debt service and capital expenditure requirements and by restrictions related to legal requirements commitments and uncertainties 

operating activities operating cash flow in 2005 was 841 million as compared to 529 million in 2004 net income was approximately 233 million higher in 2005 than 2004 working capital increased and used operating cash of 187 million as receivables increased 67 million and inventory increased 139 million offset by an increase in accounts payable and accruals of 588 million and a decrease in other current assets of 34 million deferred and accrued income taxes increased operating cash flows by 14 million and 15 million respectively in 2005 while they remained relatively unchanged in 2004 the remaining source of operating cash is due to depreciation and amortization and a net decrease in other assets less other liabilities in 2005 

  

operating cash flow in 2004 was 529 million as compared to 559 million in 2003 net income was approximately 97 million higher in 2004 than 2003 working capital decreased resulting in an increase of operating cash flow of 62 million as accounts payable and accruals increased 261 million offset by an increase in receivables inventory and other current assets of 108 million 52 million and 39 million respectively deferred and accrued income taxes remained relatively unchanged compared to an 88 million decrease in 2003 the remaining use of operating cash is due to a net increase in the other assets less other liabilities in 2004 working capital remained relatively unchanged in 2003 as receivables and inventory increased 132 million and accounts payable increased 141 million 

investing activities in 2005 and 2004 cash used in investing activities was 576 million and 178 million respectively in 2005 we acquired the assets of rutgers rail spa for 359 million net of cash received the remaining use of cash consisted almost entirely of capital expenditures net of disposals in 2003 cash used in investing activities was 125 million 

capital expenditures for continuing operations were 227 million 193 million and 175 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the majority of capital expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to and replacement of existing equipment 

financing activities in 2005 cash provided by financing activities was 28 million compared to cash used for financing activities of 185 million in 2004 

the company realized proceeds of 301 million from the exercise of stock options during 2005 during 2004 long term debt was reduced by 401 million the company also realized proceeds of 23 million from the exercise of stock options during 2004 in 2003 the company issued 150 million of senior notes due in august 2013 “the notes” the notes were issued at par and interest accrues at 6875 and is payable semiannually on january 31 and july 31 of each year the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company’s then existing bank credit agreement and for general corporate purposes 

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities 

in november 2003 the company issued common stock in connection with the registration and sale of stock by certain selling shareholders the company issued 726900 shares of common stock realizing total proceeds of about 10 million see “prospectus summary—recent development” 

the following table shows outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2005 and 2004 the revolving credit agreement and other term loan interest rates are variable and dependent on market conditions 

 

   

cash balance at december 31 2005 and 2004 was 1414 million and 953 million respectively 

on february 1 2005 the company completed the acquisition of assets of rutgers rail spa a business with operations in italy germany france and spain the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly the purchase price has been allocated to the respective assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date operating results were included in the consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date forward the new company formed to hold the newly purchased assets is named cofren srl “cofren” cofren is one of the leading manufacturers of brake shoes disc pads and interior trim components for rail applications in europe the purchase price was 359 million net of cash received resulting in additional goodwill of 57 million 

refinancing credit agreement in january 2004 the company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “refinancing credit agreement” provided a 175 million fiveyear revolving credit facility expiring in january 2009 in november 2005 the company entered into an amendment to the refinancing credit agreement which among other things extended the expiration of the agreement until december 2010 at december 31 2005 the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of 264 million of letters of credit of approximately 1486 million subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 

refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below the company did not borrow under the refinancing credit agreement during the year ended december 31 2005 

under the refinancing credit agreement we may elect a base interest rate or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest “libor” the base interest rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 625 to 175 basis points depending on the company’s consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the current margin is 625 basis points 

the refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

the refinancing credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and “change of control” of the company the refinancing credit agreement includes the following covenants a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3 maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325 and a minimum net worth of 180 million plus 50 of consolidated net income since september 30 2003 the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

  

effects of inflation 

in general inflation has not had a material impact on the company’s results of operations some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant however higher costs of metals have reduced gross margin other areas of higher costs include medical benefits for active and retired employees 

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees the company has grouped these contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements into operating activities financing activities and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information the table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2005 

 

   

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 obligations for operating activities the company has entered into 58 million of material longterm noncancelable materials and supply purchase obligations operating leases represent multiyear obligations for rental of facilities and equipment estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates expected return on longterm assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates benefits paid for pension obligations were 75 million and 61 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively benefits paid for post retirement plans were 27 million and 36 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

obligations for financing activities cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of longterm debt repayments interest payments and dividend payments to shareholders the company has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders subject to quarterly approval by our board of directors currently at a rate of 19 million annually 

in 2001 the company sold a subsidiary to that unit’s management team as part of the sale the company guaranteed approximately 3 million of bank debt of the buyer which was used for the purchase financing this debt was refinanced in june 2005 and wabtec’s guarantee was reduced to 721000 management has no reason to believe that this debt will not be repaid or refinanced

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate risk 

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt there was no outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2005 and 2004 management had entered into payfixed receivevariable interest rate swap contracts that mitigated the impact of variablerate debt interest rate increases these interest rate swap contracts were terminated in 2004 in 2003 we had concluded that our swap contracts qualified for “special cash flow hedge accounting” which permitted recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations as of december 31 2005 we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2006 

we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis all outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of us dollars usd and the purchase of canadian dollars cad as of december 31 2005 we had forward contracts with a notional value of 24 million cad or 193 million us with an average exchange rate of 080 usd per 1 cad resulting in the recording of a current asset and an increase in comprehensive income of 877000 net of tax 

  

we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 64 of wabtec’s net sales are in the united states 11 in canada 1 in mexico and 24 in other international locations primarily europe see note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31 2004 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 151 “inventory costs—an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” this standard provides clarification that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period charges additionally this standard requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions of this standard are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june 15 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 151 to have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

in december 2004 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” this statement replaces fasb statement no 123 and supersedes apb opinion no 25 no 123r eliminates the ability to account for sharebased compensation transactions using the intrinsic method currently used by the company fasb no 123r requires such transactions be accounted for using a fairvaluebased method that would result in expense being recognized in the company’s financial statements the company will be required to adopt no 123r in the first quarter of 2006 as a result of an extension granted by the securities and exchange commission on april 14 2005 the adoption of no 123r is expected to reduce quarterly earnings by approximately 001 per share in 2006 

in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position “fsp” no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” fsp 1092 provides guidance under sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “jobs act” on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability the jobs act was enacted on october 22 2004 fsp 1092 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the impact of the jobs act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying sfas no 109 the company evaluated the impact of the repatriation provisions and has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the jobs act 

in march 2005 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” this statement requires companies to recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated the provisions of this statement are effective for years ending after december 15 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of fasb 47 to have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

in june 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to financial statements of prior periods for changes in accounting principle that are not adopted prospectively this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the company does not expect the adoption of sfas 154 to have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations

 the company’s authorized capital stock includes 1000000 shares of preferred stock the board of directors has the authority to issue the preferred stock and to fix the designations powers preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series including dividend rates conversion rights voting rights terms of redemption and liquidation preferences without any further vote or action by the company’s shareholders the rights and preferences of the preferred stock would be superior to those of the common stock at december 31 2005 and 2004 there was no preferred stock issued or outstanding 

 

 the company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing discharges to air and water the handling storage and disposal of hazardous or solid waste materials and the remediation of contamination associated with releases of hazardous substances the company believes its operations currently comply in all material respects with all of the various environmental laws and regulations applicable to our business however there can be no assurance that environmental requirements will not change in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to comply with such requirements 

under terms of the purchase agreement and related documents for the 1990 acquisition american standard inc “asi” has indemnified the company for certain items including among other things certain environmental claims the company asserted prior to 2000 if asi was unable to honor or meet these indemnifications the company would be responsible for such items in the opinion of management asi currently has the ability to meet its indemnification obligations 

actions have been filed against the company and certain of its affiliates in various jurisdictions across the united states by persons alleging bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestoscontaining products since 2000 the number of such claims has increased most of these claims have been made against our whollyowned subsidiary railroad friction products corporation rfpc and are based on a product sold by rfpc before we acquired american standard inc’s asi 50 interest in rfpc in 1990 we acquired the remaining interest in rfpc in 1992 these claims include a suit against rfpc and its insurers seeking coverage under rfpc’s insurance policies on april 17 2005 the claim against the company contending that the company assumed asi’s liability for asbestos claims arising from exposure to rfpc’s products was resolved in the company’s favor 

most of these claims including all of the rfpc claims are submitted to insurance carriers for defense and indemnity or to nonaffiliated companies that retain the liabilities for the asbestoscontaining products at issue we cannot however assure that all these claims will be fully covered by insurance or that the indemnitors will remain financially viable our ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these claims as is the case with other pending litigation cannot be estimated

the company recorded a loss provision of 16 million in the first quarter of 2005 related to a contract to assemble locomotive modules in our boise idaho facility this provision was based upon customer purchase orders for units expected to be unprofitable and other specific contract costs during the third quarter of 2005 as a result of the termination of the contract and improvements in cost the entire reserve was reversed to earnings also during the third quarter the company expensed 12 million of capitalized preproduction costs and recognized 161000 of other costs this contract termination potentially reduces the number of locomotive modules the company may supply to the customer but immediately allows for price increases on current and future orders 

the company is subject to a rcra part b closure permit “the permit” issued by the environmental protection agency epa and the idaho department of health and welfare division of environmental quality relating to the monitoring and treatment of groundwater contamination on and adjacent to the motivepower industries boise idaho facility in compliance with the permit the company has completed the first phase of an accelerated plan for the treatment of contaminated groundwater and continues onsite and offsite monitoring for hazardous constituents an additional 970000 was accrued in 2004 based on our refined estimates of ongoing monitoring costs the company reevaluated the reserve and reversed 280000 to earnings in 2005 in total the company has accrued 702000 at december 31 2005 the estimated remaining costs for remediation and monitoring the company was in compliance with the permit at december 31 2005 

foster wheeler energy corporation “fwec” the seller of the mountaintop pennsylvania property to the predecessor of one of the company’s subsidiaries in 1989 agreed to indemnify the company’s predecessor and its successors and assigns against certain identified environmental liabilities for which fwec executed a consent order agreement with the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep and epa management believes that this indemnification arrangement is enforceable for the benefit of the company and that fwec has the financial resources to honor its obligations under this indemnification arrangement 

prior to the company’s acquisition of young radiator young agreed to clean up alleged contamination on a prior production site in mattoon illinois the company is in the process of remediating the site with the state of illinois and now estimates the costs to remediate the site to be approximately 5000 which has been accrued at december 31 2005 

young ceased manufacturing operations at its racine wisconsin facility in the early 1990s investigations prior to the acquisition of young revealed some levels of contamination on the racine property and the company has begun remediation efforts the company has initiated a comprehensive site evaluation with the state of wisconsin and believes this governing body is generally in agreement with the findings the company has accrued approximately 126000 at december 31 2005 as its estimate of the remaining remediation costs 

on november 3 2000 the company settled a suit brought against it in 1999 by geharris railway electronics llc and geharris railway electronics services llc collectively “geharris” on september 20 2002 a motion in that lawsuit was filed by the successor to geharris ge transportation services global signaling llc “getsgs” the motion by getsgs contended that the company is acting beyond authority granted in the parties’ november 2000 settlement and license agreement and in contempt of the consent order that concluded the suit at that time 

in support of its motion getsgs pointed principally to sales and offers to sell certain railway brake equipment including distributed power equipment to australian customers in august 2004 the united states district court for the district of delaware ruled partially in favor of getsgs ordering the company to pay compensatory damages for lost licensing profits related to the above mentioned distributed power equipment contracts and reimbursement for reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses while the company disagrees with the ruling and intends to continue to contest this ruling this liability of 32 million was recognized in 2004 as a component of selling general and administrative expense should an option be exercised by the company’s australian customers for additional shipments of products under the same distributed power contracts an

additional 27 million of compensatory damages could be owed to getsgs the additional liability will not be recognized by the company until and if such option is exercised 

the company has other contingent obligations relating to certain sales leaseback transactions for locomotives that were assumed in connection with the motivepower merger in 1999 for which reserves of 33 million have been established 

in april 2005 amtrak decided to suspend its acela express train service due to cracks in the spokes of some of the cars’ brake discs wabtec did not design or supply the braking system for the acela cars the braking system was supplied by knorr brake corporation and the brake discs were designed by faiveley transport wabtec did provide and machined approximately onethird of the brake discs for the cars and assisted amtrak and others including bombardier corporation alstom transportation inc knorr and faiveley in their evaluation and investigation of the brake disc cracks amtrak claims approximately 30 million in damages due to the suspension of the acela service which was resumed on a limited basis in july and complete service was resumed in september wabtec has received notice of a potential claim for damages from knorr and in turn has provided notice of a potential claim for damages to faiveley wabtec does not believe that it has any material liability with regard to this matter 

in march 2006 management began an internal investigation related to business transactions conducted by a subsidiary pioneer friction limited “pioneer” in west bengal india through an internal compliance review management discovered that disbursements were made which may be in violation of applicable laws and regulations pioneer is a fourthtier subsidiary of wabtec two of the intermediate subsidiaries are australian companies which are in turn owned by a us holding company 

while the transactions are inconsequential and not material to the overall operations of wabtec they may result in potential penalties management has not concluded its investigation but has informed wabtec’s audit committee board of directors and the appropriate authorities wabtec has not recorded a reserve related to this matter as of december 31 2005 because the company’s potential exposure cannot be estimated based on management’s current assessment of the situation 

from time to time the company is involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of its operations in the ordinary course of business as of the date hereof the company is involved in no litigation that the company believes will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

 

 wabtec has two reportable segments—the freight group and the transit group the key factors used to identify these reportable segments are the organization and alignment of the company’s internal operations the nature of the products and services and customer type the business segments are 

freight group manufactures products and provides services geared to the production and operation of freight cars and locomotives including braking control equipment onboard electronic components and train coupler equipment revenues are derived from oem sales of components and locomotives aftermarket sales and freight car repairs and services all of the assets sold to gets were part of the freight group 

transit group consists of products for passenger transit vehicles typically subways rail and buses that include braking coupling and monitoring systems climate control and door equipment engineered to meet individual customer specifications revenues are derived from oem and aftermarket sales as well as from repairs and services

general 

  

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation doing business as wabtec corporation is a delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 air brake avenue in wilmerding pennsylvania our telephone number is 4128251000 and our website is located at wwwwabteccom  all references to “we” “our” “us” the “company” and “wabtec” refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation and its subsidiaries originally founded by george westinghouse in 1869 westinghouse air brake company “wabco” was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from american standard inc asi the current business includes the combined assets from the november 1999 merger of wabco and motivepower industries inc “motivepower” 

  

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold about a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a number 1 or number 2 position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles in 2004 the company had sales of 822 million and net income of 324 million sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about 54 of total sales in 2004 

  

management and insiders of the company own approximately 8 of wabtec’s outstanding shares with the balance held by investment companies and individuals executive management incentive compensation focuses on earnings cash flow working capital and economic profit targets to align management interests with those of outside shareholders 

  

industry overview 

  

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and passenger transit rail industries the worldwide market for rail equipment has been estimated at about 70 billion annually and it is estimated to grow at about 4 annually for the next five years our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry many factors influence the industry including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government investment in public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems customers outside north america account for about 22 of wabtec’s sales 

  

in north america railroads carry about 42 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s mostefficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities coal accounts for the most tons and revenues about 44 and about 20 respectively in 2004 intermodal traffic—the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation—has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

  

outside of north america many of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia india and china have been 

  

investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies these investment programs represent additional opportunities for wabtec to provide products and services 

  

in the us passenger transit is a 32 billion industry dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s passenger transit vehicles new york city is the largest passenger transit market in the us passenger transit ridership is near an alltime high after increasing throughout the 1990s due to steady growth in the us economy based on preliminary figures for 2004 ridership is expected to be about the same as in 2003 in response to lower fare box revenues and government funding cutbacks transit authorities have delayed capital expenditures for new equipment and deferred maintenance on existing equipment new york city however has continued to invest in new equipment as demonstrated by its order for up to 1700 new subway vehicles including options which are expected to be delivered beginning in 2006 

  

demand for our freight related products and services in north america is driven by a number of factors including 

   

   

   

demand for north american passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors including 

  

   

   

business segments and products 

  

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight group and the passenger transit group hereafter referred to as “transit group” the freight group manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives while the transit group does the same for passenger transit vehicles typically subways and buses both business segments serve original equipment manufacturers oems and provide aftermarket sales and services with the aftermarket accounting for about 54 of net sales in 2004 the freight group accounted for 71 of our total net sales and the transit group accounted for the remaining 29 in 2004 the freight group generated 58 of its net sales from the aftermarket and 42 of its net sales from the oems and class i railroads the transit group generated 42 of its net sales from the aftermarket and 58 of its net sales from oems a summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments is outlined below 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we manufacture sell and service highquality electronics for railroads in the form of onboard systems and braking for locomotives and freight cars we harden our products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments recently we have concentrated our new product development on extending electronic technology to braking and control systems 

  

we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation our new product development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and controls over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic brakes and positive train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols the transit group also focuses on new product development and has introduced a number of new products during the past several years supported by our technical staff of over 500 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers we currently own over 1000 active patents worldwide and 500 us patents during the last three years we have filed for more than 150 us patents in support of our new and evolving product lines 

  

for additional information on our business segments see note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

competitive strengths 

  

our key strengths include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

business strategy 

  

we are focused on executing the following fourpoint growth strategy 

  

   

   

   

   

backlog 

  

in 2004 54 of our sales came from aftermarket orders aftermarket orders typically carry lead times of less than 30 days so they are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time as such the company’s backlog is primarily an indicator of future original equipment sales not expected aftermarket activity 

  

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for 

  

these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled so backlog should not be relied upon as an indicator of the company’s future performance the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

  

the backlog of customer orders as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

  

   

engineering and development 

  

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 we invested about 338 million 329 million and 336 million respectively on product development and improvement activities approximately 40 of these costs comprise activities solely devoted to new product development in any given year these engineering and development expenditures in total represent about 41 46 and 48 of net sales for the same periods respectively sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

  

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for a long time but freight railroads have been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads 

  

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

  

intellectual property 

  

we have more than 1000 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

  

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of american standard 

  

we are a party as licensor and licensee to a variety of license agreements we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

  

we entered into a license agreement with faiveley transport formerly sab wabco holdings bv on december 31 1993 pursuant to which faiveley transport granted us a license to the intellectual property and knowhow related to the manufacturing and marketing of certain disc brakes tread brakes and low noise and 

  

resilient wheel products sab wabco holdings bv was a former affiliate of wabtec since both were owned by the same parent company in the early 1990s the faiveley transport license expired december 31 2004 but has been renewed for an additional oneyear term as provided in the license agreement the license may be renewed for additional oneyear terms 

  

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabco ltd and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

  

customers 

  

our customers include railroads throughout north america as well as in australia europe south africa and india manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses lessors of such equipment and passenger transit authorities primarily those in north america 

  

in 2004 about 78 of our sales were to customers in north america but we also shipped products to more than 82 countries throughout the world about 54 of our sales were in the aftermarket with the rest of our sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

  

our top five customers general electric transportation systems bombardier burlington northern santa fe electromotive division of general motors and amtrak accounted for 26 of our net sales in 2004 no one customer represents 10 or more of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

  

competition 

  

we believe that we hold about a 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a no 1 or no 2 market position in north america for most of our other product lines nonetheless we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

  

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support our principal competitors vary to some extent across product lines but most competitors are smaller privately held companies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations the electromotive division of general motors general electric transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2004 we had 4905 fulltime employees approximately 39 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements generally extend through late 2005 2006 2007 and 2009 

  

we consider our relations with our employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

  

regulation 

  

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar 

  

the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce 

  

the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes 

  

as a result of these regulations and regulations in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

  

effects of seasonality 

  

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period 

  

environmental matters 

  

information on environmental matters is included in note 18 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

overview 

  

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles in the us as well as in certain markets throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles 

  

wabtec is a global company with operations in nine countries in 2004 about 78 percent of the company’s revenues came from its north american operations but wabtec also sold products or services in 82 countries around the world 

  

management review of 2004 and future outlook 

  

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy in addition management monitors the company’s shortterm operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

  

in 2004 we achieved the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we achieved these results despite higher raw material costs especially steel and copper and despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates especially on the company’s canadian operations 

  

freight rail industry statistics such as carloadings and orders for new freight cars improved in 2004 for example carloadings grew 29 compared to 2003 as the freight railroads benefited from the strengthening economy in the us as shown below orders for new freight cars increased to 70291 in 2004 as a result the backlog of freight cars ordered was 58677 its highest yearend level since 1998 sales in our freight segment have demonstrated that trend the following are quarterly freight car statistics for the past three years 

  

   

   

source railway supply institute 

  

the following is a summary of freight car locomotive and transit car deliveries for the industry 

  

   

based on company estimates 

  

management is forecasting a slight increase in deliveries of freight and transit cars 

  

carloadings and intermodal units originated have grown proportionally over the past three years reflecting higher rail traffic and ultimately better opportunities for maintenance and aftermarket sales for the company 

  

carloadings originated in thousands 

  

   

intermodal units originated in thousands 

  

   

source association of american railroads—weekly rail traffic 

  

in 2005 we expect demand to improve due to continued strength in the freight rail and passenger transit aftermarket as well as growth in the market for new freight cars looking beyond 2005 we expect to generate increases in sales and earnings from executing our fourpoint growth strategy see page 5 for more details 

  

   

   

   

   

in 2005 and beyond we will continue to face many challenges including increased costs for raw materials especially steel higher costs for medical and insurance premiums and foreign currency fluctuations in addition 

  

we face general economic risks as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 

  

   

2004 compared to 2003 

  

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

  

   

net sales increased by 145 from 7179 million in 2003 to 822 million in 2004 primarily as a result of volume increases in freight car locomotive and transit car deliveries aftermarket part sales increased because of 

  

carloadings and intermodal units originated the company did not realize any significant net sales improvement because of price increases or foreign exchange net income for 2004 was 324 million or 071 per diluted share net income for 2003 was 227 million or 052 per diluted share this increase in net income was primarily due to increased sales and a favorable tax benefit 

  

the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

  

   

net sales net sales for 2004 increased 1041 million or 145 as compared to 2003 sales increased in both the freight group and the transit group the freight group’s increased sales reflected higher sales of certain components to international markets higher demand for pneumatic air brake components related to increased delivery of freight cars and locomotives and greater demand for friction products due to overall increased rail traffic in 2004 industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2004 increased to 46292 units as compared to 31400 in 2003 the transit group’s increased sales were due to increased deliveries under existing contracts and higher aftermarket sales 

  

gross profit gross profit increased to 2052 million in 2004 compared to 1895 million in 2003 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix gross profit as a percentage of sales was 25 compared to 264 in 2003 the decrease in gross profit percentage is primarily due to increased manufacturing costs because of higher raw material prices higher medical costs for retiree health plans and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates on the company’s canadian operations other issues reducing gross profit percentage include inefficiencies relating to the closing and relocation of an electronics plant from canada to the us the establishment of a 970000 reserve to reflect future environmental monitoring at our boise facility fixed asset impairment charges of 13 million and the start up of lowmargin rail door contracts in the transit group also the provision for warranty expense negatively impacted gross profit having increased 44 million in 2004 compared to 2003 the provision for warranty expense is higher due to a combination of higher sales requiring additional reserves and charges for certain specific products although the warranty provision increased in 2004 warranty claims decreased resulting in an overall increase of 41 million in our warranty reserves the company is taking action to improve margins in future quarters including price increases and ongoing initiatives to increase productivity and efficiency 

  

the following table shows our operating expenses 

  

   

operating expenses operating expenses increased 101 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 including a 32 million unfavorable litigation ruling to getsgs which the company disagrees with and intends to continue to contest other costs comprising the increase include restructuring costs at the company’s electronics unit higher medical and insurance claims experience foreign exchange costs and overall higher costs from inflation and sales activity these increases were partially offset by reduced amortization expense amortization expense decreased due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized 

  

income from operations  income from operations totaled 554 million or 67 of sales in 2004 compared with 498 million or 69 of sales in 2003 higher operating income resulted from increased sales in 2004 offset by higher operating expenses 

  

interest expense interest expense increased 37 in 2004 as compared to 2003 primarily due to the company’s sale of senior notes in august 2003 these notes while resulting in higher interest expense for the current year enabled the company to convert shortterm variablerate debt into fixedrate debt at an attractive longterm interest rate 

  

other expense the company incurred foreign exchange losses of 12 million and 28 million respectively in 2004 and 2003 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

  

income taxes 2004 includes a tax benefit of 49 million primarily related to the reversal of certain items that had previously been provided for that were closed from further regulatory examination the effective income tax rate not including the aforementioned tax benefit remains unchanged and was 365 for 2004 and 2003 in 2004 the american jobs creation act of 2004 was passed the company is in the process of evaluating the impact to the company and its subsidiaries 

  

net income  net income for 2004 increased 97 million compared with 2003 the increase was due to higher sales and the tax benefit mentioned above partially offset by other items including the unfavorable getsgs litigation ruling increased environmental reserve and higher manufacturing costs 

  

2003 compared to 2002 

  

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

  

   

in 2002 we completed fair value assessments of goodwill and wrote down the carrying value of goodwill by 90 million 832 million for the freight group and 68 million for the transit group in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the total impact of the writedown net of taxes was 617 million 

  

the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

  

   

net sales net sales for 2003 increased 217 million or 31 as compared to 2002 the increased sales in the freight group more than offset lower sales in the transit group the freight group’s increased sales reflected higher sales of components for new freight cars and locomotives and commuter locomotives as well as 

  

higher international sales industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2003 increased to about 31400 units as compared to about 17700 in 2002 the transit group’s decreased sales were due to the completion of a contract to supply components for new york city subway cars in 2002 and lower aftermarket sales 

  

gross profit gross profit increased to 1895 million in 2003 compared to 1795 million in 2002 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix gross profit as a percentage of sales was 264 compared to 258 in 2002 the increase in gross profit percentage is primarily due to higher sales and favorable product mix which more than offset the negative impact of the weakening us dollar versus the canadian dollar 

  

the following table shows our operating expenses 

  

   

operating expenses operating expenses increased 69 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the writeoff of nonoperating assets of 16 million and higher medical and insurance premiums partially offset by reduced amortization expense amortization expense decreased due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized 

  

income from operations  income from operations totaled 498 million or 69 of sales in 2003 compared with 467 million or 67 of sales in 2002 higher operating income resulted from increased sales and gross margins but was partially offset by increased operating expenses in 2003 

  

interest expense interest expense decreased 419 in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a substantial decrease in debt 

  

other expense the company incurred foreign exchange losses of 28 million and 12 million respectively in 2003 and 2002 due to the effect of currency exchange rate changes on intercompany transactions that are non us dollar denominated amounts and charged or credited to earnings 

  

income taxes 2003 includes a tax benefit of 27 million primarily related to the reversal of certain items that had previously been provided for that were closed from further regulatory examination the effective income tax rate was 365 for 2003 and 32 for 2002 the change in the effective tax rate was due to a higher effective state tax rate and increased statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions also increased income has reduced the significance of the favorable impact the company’s utilization of foreign tax credits has on the effective tax rate 

  

net income  net income for 2003 increased 682 million compared with 2002 which included a 617 million net of tax write off of goodwill income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased 65 million compared with 2002 the increase was due to increased sales improved margins and lower interest expense 

  

income taxes 

  

management believes in the next three years cash outlays for income taxes will be less than income tax expense due to the utilization of nols and the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets which will continue to be amortized for tax purposes the company’s current level of pretax income is sufficient to utilize 

  

the deferred tax assets in 2004 the company has produced a 11 million federal net operating loss to be carried forward a portion of the reported federal credits in the amount of 42 million will be realized through a carry back claim management believes tax planning opportunities exist in various foreign countries that will allow the company to utilize foreign net operating loss carryforwards at an accelerated rate any tax assets that are uncertain regarding realization have a valuation allowance in the full amount of the asset management believes the remaining assets will be realized in the normal course of business 

  

the overall effective income tax rate includes a tax benefit of 49 million and 27 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively which is primarily related to the reversal of certain items that had previously been provided for and that have been closed from further regulatory examination 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under the company’s unsecured credit facility with a consortium of commercial banks “credit agreement” the following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data 

  

   

management utilizes ebitda as a measure of liquidity the following is a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities 

  

   

ebitda is defined as earnings before deducting interest expense income taxes and depreciation and amortization although ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles management believes that it is useful to an investor in evaluating wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a company’s operating performance and ability to service debt financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on ebitda ebitda does not purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in addition because ebitda is not calculated identically by all companies the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies management’s discretionary use of funds depicted by ebitda may be limited by working capital debt service and capital expenditure requirements and by restrictions related to legal requirements commitments and uncertainties 

  

operating activities operating cash flow in 2004 was 529 million as compared to 559 million in 2003 net income was approximately 97 million higher in 2004 than 2003 working capital decreased and generated operating cash by 62 million as accounts payable and accruals increased 261 million offset by an increase in receivables inventory and other current assets of 108 million 52 million and 39 million respectively deferred and accrued income taxes remained relatively unchanged compared to an 88 million decrease in 2003 the remaining use of operating cash is due to a net increase in the other assets less other liabilities in 2004 

  

operating cash flow in 2003 was 559 million as compared to 157 million in 2002 working capital remained relatively unchanged in 2003 as receivables and inventory increased 132 million and accounts payable increased 141 million also deferred income taxes decreased by 88 million in 2003 

  

during 2002 cash outlays for merger and restructuring activities was approximately 25 million and is reported as a reduction to cash provided by operating activities also in 2002 30 million was paid in taxes related to the gain on the sale of locomotive aftermarket assets in 2001 the operating cash flow in 2002 excluding the 30 million tax payment from 2001 was approximately 46 million 

  

investing activities in 2004 and 2003 cash used in investing activities was 178 million and 125 million respectively consisting almost entirely of capital expenditures net of disposals in 2002 cash used in investing activities was 108 million in 2002 the company used 17 million for certain business acquisitions see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for further information 

  

capital expenditures for continuing operations were 193 million 175 million and 141 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the majority of capital expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to and replacement of existing equipment 

  

financing activities in 2004 cash used for financing activities was 185 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of 92 million in 2003 

  

during 2004 long term debt was reduced by 401 million the company also realized proceeds of 23 million from the exercise of stock options during 2004 in 2003 the company issued 150 million of senior notes due in august 2013 “the notes” the notes were issued at par and interest accrues at 6875 and is payable semiannually on january 31 and july 31 of each year commencing on january 31 2004 the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company’s then existing bank credit agreement and for general corporate purposes 

  

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

  

in november 2003 the company issued common stock in connection with the registration and sale of stock by certain selling shareholders the company issued 726900 shares of common stock realizing total proceeds of about 10 million see “prospectus summary—recent development” 

  

cash used for financing activities was 441 million in 2002 during 2002 the company reduced longterm debt by 459 million we repaid 175 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2002 to take advantage of lower interest rates on our revolving credit agreement historically the company have financed the purchase of significant businesses utilizing cash flow generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facilities 

  

the following table shows outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2004 and 2003 the revolving credit agreement and other term loan interest rates are variable and dependent on market conditions 

  

   

cash balance at december 31 2004 and 2003 was 953 million and 703 million respectively 

  

on february 1 2005 the company completed the acquisition of assets of rütgers rail spa the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and accordingly the purchase price will be allocated to the respective assets and liabilities based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date operating results will be included in the consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date forward the new company formed to hold the newly purchased assets of rütgers rail spa is named cofren srl “cofren” cofren has become the leading manufacturer of brake shoes disc pads and interior trim components for rail applications in europe the purchase price was 366 million in cash and is subject to adjustment based on a calculation of net worth as defined in the sale and purchase agreement the adjustment is to be completed within 90 business days of the acquisition date 

  

refinancing credit agreement in january 2004 the company refinanced its existing unsecured revolving credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “refinancing credit agreement” provides a 175 million fiveyear revolving credit facility expiring in january 2009 at december 31 2004 the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of 219 million of letters of credit of approximately 1531 million subject to certain financial covenant restrictions 

  

refinancing credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described below the maximum credit agreement borrowings average credit agreement borrowings and weightedaverage contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings were 40 million 367 million and 29 respectively for 2004 to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts on december 31 2003 the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled 40 million and effectively changed our interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 398 the interest rate swap agreements were terminated for a net gain of about 200000 in 2004 in conjunction with the 40 million repayment of the revolving credit agreement 

  

under the refinancing credit agreement we may elect a base interest rate or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest “libor” the base interest rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 100 to 200 basis points depending on our consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the current margin is 100 basis points 

  

the refinancing credit agreement limits the company’s ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

  

the refinancing credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and “change of control” of the company the refinancing credit agreement includes the following covenants a minimum interest coverage ratio of 30 maximum debt to cash flow ratio of 325 and a minimum net worth of 180 million plus 50 of consolidated net income since september 30 2003 the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

management believes that based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting debt service requirements if sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the company’s cash requirements the company may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

  

extinguishment of other debt in june 1995 the company issued 100 million of 9375 senior notes due in 2005 the “1995 notes” in january 1999 the company issued an additional 75 million of 9375 senior notes due in 2005 the “1999 notes” the 1995 notes and the 1999 notes were redeemed at par face on july 8 2002 through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement this redemption resulted in a noncash loss of 19 million relating to a writeoff of deferred debt issuance costs 

  

effects of inflation 

  

in general inflation has not had a material impact on the company’s results of operations some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant however higher costs of metals have reduced gross margin other areas of higher costs include medical benefits for active and retired employees 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees the company has grouped these contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements into operating activities financing activities and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information the table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2004 

  

    

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

obligations for operating activities the company has entered into 347000 of material longterm noncancelable materials and supply purchase obligations operating leases represent multiyear obligations for rental of facilities and equipment estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates expected return on longterm assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates benefits paid for pension obligations were 61 million and 57 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively benefits paid for post retirement plans were 35 million and 21 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

obligations for financing activities cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of longterm debt repayments and dividend payments to shareholders the company has historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders subject to quarterly approval by our board of directors currently at a rate of 18 million annually 

  

in 2001 the company sold a subsidiary to that unit’s management team as part of the sale the company guaranteed approximately 3 million of bank debt of the buyer which was used for the purchase financing this debt was refinanced in june 2004 and wabtec’s guarantee was reduced to 13 million management has no reason to believe that this debt will not be repaid or refinanced 

  

the company arranges for performance bonds to be issued by third party insurance companies to support certain long term customer contracts at december 31 2004 initial value of performance bonds issued on the company’s behalf is about 150 million 

  

obligations for investing activities the company typically spends approximately 1525 million a year for capital expenditures primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization health and safety and environmental control the company expects annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the 

  

reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives environmental matters warranty reserves the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment proceeds on assets to be sold pensions and other postretirement benefits and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in notes 2 and 18 respectively in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

  

the company recognizes revenues on longterm contracts based on the percentage of completion method of accounting the unitsofdelivery method or other outputbased measures as appropriate are used to measure the progress of individual contracts towards completion contract revenues and cost estimates are reviewed and revised at a minimum quarterly and adjustments are reflected in the accounting period as known provisions are made currently for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts certain preproduction costs relating to long term production and supply contracts have been deferred and will be amortized over the life of the contract 

  

in 2002 we adopted the new standard of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives the cumulative effect adjustment recognized on january 1 2002 upon adoption of the new standard was a charge of 617 million after tax also in 2002 amortization ceased for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives total amortization expense for intangible assets recognized was 24 million in 2004 34 million in 2003 and 4 million in 2002 additionally goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill we use a combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” to determine the current fair value of the business a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecasted operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volume and pricing costs to produce and working capital changes management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated however actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

  

the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

  

the company provides warranty reserves to cover expected costs from repairing or replacing products with durability quality or workmanship issues occurring during established warranty periods in general reserves are provided for as a percentage of sales based on historical experience in addition specific reserves are established for known warranty issues and their estimable losses 

  

inventory is reviewed to ensure that an adequate provision is recognized for excess slow moving and obsolete inventories the company compares inventory components to prior year sales history and current backlog requirements to the extent that inventory parts exceed estimated usage and demand a reserve is recognized to reduce the carrying value of inventory also specific reserves are established for known inventory obsolescence 

  

other areas of significant judgments and estimates include the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets 

  

as a global company wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount management does not believe that such a charge would be material

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

interest rate risk 

  

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with variablerate debt there was no outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2004 after considering the effects of interest rate swaps further described below our variable rate debt represented 0 of total longterm debt at december 31 2003 management had entered into payfixed receivevariable interest rate swap contracts that mitigated the impact of variablerate debt interest rate increases these interest rate swap contracts were terminated in 2004 in 2003 we had concluded that our swap contracts qualified for “special cash flow hedge accounting” which permitted recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet see note 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations as of december 31 2004 we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2005 

  

we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis all outstanding forward contracts are for the sale of us dollars usd and the purchase of canadian dollars cad as of december 31 2004 we had forward contracts with a notional value of 59 million cad or 435 million us with an average exchange rate of 074 usd per 1 cad resulting in the recording of a current asset and an increase in comprehensive income of 36 million net of tax 

  

we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 66 of wabtec’s net sales are in the united states 10 in canada 2 in mexico and 22 in other international locations primarily europe see note 19 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31 2003

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased equipment and services for the global rail industry we believe we hold a greater than 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a number 1 or number 2 position in north america for most of our other product lines our highly engineered products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles we are a “tier 1” supplier with approximately 44 of our net sales in 2003 to original equipment manufacturers oems in 2003 the company had sales of 7179 million and net income of 227 million 

  

management and insiders of the company own approximately 12 of wabtec’s outstanding shares with the balance held by investment companies and individuals executive management incentive compensation focuses on earnings cash flow and working capital targets to align management interests with those of outside shareholders 

  

industry overview 

  

the company primarily serves the worldwide freight and passenger transit rail industries the worldwide market for rail equipment has been estimated at about 70 billion annually and it is estimated to grow at about 4 annually for the next five years our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad industry many factors influence the industry including general economic conditions rail traffic as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership government investment in public transportation and investment in new technologies by freight and passenger rail systems customers in north america account for about 79 of wabtec’s sales 

  

in north america railroads carry about 42 of intercity freight as measured by tonmiles which is more than any other mode of transportation they are an integral part of the continent’s economy and transportation system serving nearly every industrial wholesale and retail sector through direct ownership and operating partnerships us railroads are part of an integrated network that includes railroads in canada and mexico forming what is regarded as the world’s most efficient and lowestcost freight rail service there are more than 500 railroads operating in north america with the largest railroads referred to as “class i” accounting for more than 90 of the industry’s revenues although the railroads carry a wide variety of commodities coal accounts for the most tons and revenues about 45 and about 20 respectively in 2003 intermodal traffic – the movement of trailers or containers by rail in combination with another mode of transportation – has been the railroads’ fastestgrowing market segment in the past 10 years railroads operate in a competitive environment especially with the trucking industry and are always seeking ways to improve safety cost and reliability new technologies offered by wabtec and others in the industry can provide some of these benefits 

  

outside of north america most of the rail systems have historically been focused on passenger transit rather than freight in recent years however railroads in countries such as australia india and china have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems throughout the world governmentowned railroads are being sold to private owners who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies these investment programs represent additional opportunities for wabtec to provide products and services 

  

in the us public transportation is a 32 billion industry dependent largely on funding from federal state and local governments and from fare box revenues with about 40 of the nation’s transit vehicles new york city is the largest transit market in the us transit ridership is near an alltime high after increasing throughout the 1990’s due to steady growth in the us economy ridership declined 13 in 2002 however as the economy slowed based on preliminary figures for 2003 ridership is expected to decline at about the same rate in response to lower fare box revenues and government funding cutbacks transit authorities have delayed capital expenditures for new equipment and deferred maintenance on existing equipment new york city however has continued to invest in new equipment as demonstrated by its order for up to 1700 new subway vehicles including options which are expected to be delivered beginning in 2006 

  

demand for our products and services in north america are driven by a number of factors including

business segments and products 

  

we provide our products and services through two principal business segments the freight group and the transit group the freight group manufactures and services components for new and existing freight cars and locomotives while the transit group does the same for passenger transit vehicles typically subways and buses both business segments serve oems and provide aftermarket services with the aftermarket accounting for about 56 of net sales in 2003 the freight group accounted for 73 of our total net sales and the transit group accounted for the remaining 27 in 2003 the freight group generated 39 of its net sales from oems and class i railroads and 61 of its net sales from the aftermarket while the transit group generated 59 of its net sales from oems and 41 of its net sales from the aftermarket a summary of our leading product lines across both of our business segments is outlined below 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we manufacture sell and service highquality electronics for railroads in the form of onboard systems and braking for locomotives and freight cars we harden our products to protect them from severe conditions including extreme temperatures and highvibration environments recently we have concentrated our new product development on extending electronic technology to braking and control systems 

  

we have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products technological capabilities and new product innovation our new product development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and controls over the past several years we introduced a number of significant new products including electronic brakes and positive train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols the transit group also focuses on new product development 

  

and has introduced a number of new products during the past several years supported by our technical staff of over 500 engineers and specialists we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines which enables us to provide comprehensive systemsbased solutions for our customers we currently own over 2000 active patents worldwide and 500 us patents during the last three years we have filed for more than 150 us patents in support of our new and evolving product lines

competitive strengths 

  

our key strengths include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

business strategy 

  

we are focused on executing the following fourpoint growth strategy 

  

   

   

   

   

backlog 

  

in 2003 56 of our sales came from aftermarket orders aftermarket orders typically carry lead times of less than 30 days so they are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time as such the company’s backlog is primarily an indicator of future original equipment sales not expected aftermarket activity 

  

the company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons completion of the company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled so backlog should not be relied upon as an indicator of the company’s future performance the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation 

  

the backlog of customer orders as of december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 and the expected year of completion are as follows 

  

   

engineering and development 

  

to execute our strategy to develop new products we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 we invested about 329 million 336 million and 332 million respectively on product development and improvement activities approximately 40 of these costs comprise activities solely devoted to new product development in any given year these engineering and development expenditures in total represent about 46 48 and 42 of net sales for the same periods respectively sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers 

  

our engineering and development program is largely focused upon train control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for a long time but freight railroads have been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interchangeability connectivity and durability we are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads 

  

we use our product development system pds to develop and monitor all new product programs the system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process from concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets 

  

intellectual property 

  

we have more than 2000 active patents worldwide we also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property 

  

certain trademarks among them the name wabco ®  were acquired or licensed from american standard inc in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of american standard 

  

we are a party as licensor and licensee to a variety of license agreements we do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole 

  

we entered into a license agreement with sab wabco holdings bv sab on december 31 1993 pursuant to which sab granted us a license to the intellectual property and knowhow related to the manufacturing and marketing of certain disc brakes tread brakes and low noise and resilient wheel products sab is a former affiliate of wabtec since both were owned by the same parent company in the early 1990s in 2002 sab was purchased by vestar capital partners iv lp an affiliate of vestar equity partners lp and vestar capital partners inc both of which were then significant shareholders of wabtec 

  

in november 2003 vestar equity partners and vestar capital partners sold their entire stake in wabtec consisting of 2440000 wabtec common shares in a registered secondary offering the sab license expired december 31 2003 but has been renewed for an additional oneyear term as provided in the license agreement the license may be renewed for additional oneyear terms 

  

we have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in japan nabco ltd and mitsubishi electric company the licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north america we believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in north america 

  

customers 

  

our customers include railroads throughout north america as well as in australia south africa india italy and the united kingdom manufacturers of transportation equipment such as locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses lessors of such equipment and passenger transit authorities primarily those in north america 

  

in 2003 about 79 of our sales were to customers in north america but we also shipped products to more than 62 countries throughout the world about 56 of our sales were in the aftermarket with the rest of our sales to oems of locomotives freight cars subway vehicles and buses 

  

our top five customers northeast illinois railroad corporation metra general electric transportation systems bombardier burlington northern santa fe and alstom accounted for 26 of our net sales in 2003 our top customer metra represented 7 of consolidated sales we believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers 

  

competition 

  

we believe that we hold a greater than 50 market share in north america for our primary brakingrelated equipment and a no 1 or no 2 market position in north america for most of our other product lines nonetheless we operate in a highly competitive marketplace price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very costconscious 

  

in addition to price competition is based on product performance and technological leadership quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support our principal competitors vary to some extent across product lines but most competitors are smaller privately held companies within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag is our principal overall oem competitor our competition for locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair is 

  

primarily from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ inhouse operations the electromotive division of general motors general electric transportation systems and new york air brakeknorr we believe our key strengths which include leading market positions in core products breadth of product offering with a stable mix of oem and aftermarket business leading design and engineering capabilities significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2003 we had 4482 fulltime employees approximately 36 of whom were unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements generally extend through late 2004 2005 and 2006 

  

we consider our relations with our employees and union representatives to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us 

  

regulation 

  

in the course of our operations we are subject to various regulations of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally the fra and the aar 

  

the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce 

  

the aar oversees a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval processes 

  

as a result of these regulations and regulations in other countries in which we derive our revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a component manufacturer and for products we sell 

  

effects of seasonality 

  

our business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of its major customers during this period

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

overview 

  

wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of valueadded technologybased products and services for the global rail industry our products are found on virtually all locomotives freight cars and passenger transit vehicles in the us as well as in certain markets throughout the world our products enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers and many of our core products and services are essential in the safe and efficient operation of freight rail and passenger transit vehicles 

  

wabtec is a global company with operations in nine countries in 2003 about 79 percent of the company’s revenues came from its north american operations but wabtec also sold products or services in 62 countries around the world 

  

management review of 2003 and future outlook 

  

wabtec’s longterm financial goals are to generate free cash flow in excess of net income maintain a strong credit profile while minimizing our overall cost of capital increase margins through strict attention to cost controls and increase revenues through a focused growth strategy in addition management monitors the company’s shortterm operational performance through measures such as quality and ontime delivery 

  

in 2003 we achieved the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we achieved these results despite continued weakness in demand for aftermarket products and services and a 23 drop in sales in the transit group which completed several major contracts in 2002 in addition foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on the company’s canadian operations 

  

we expect increased demand for our products as the us economy recovers government transit spending increases and class i railroads utilities and leasing companies begin to reinvest in their fleets after deferring capital spending during the difficult us economic environment since 2001 we anticipate that this increased capital spending will positively impact rail industry fundamentals which have shown gradual improvement over the past few quarters as evidenced by betterthanexpected freight car orders and backlog for example freight car deliveries increased to 9170 in the fourth quarter of 2003 an increase of 11 over the prior quarter and up 91 over the prior year the table below demonstrates the improving trends in the freight car segment of the rail industry 

  

   

source railway supply institute 

  

freight car locomotive and transit car deliveries for the industry are expected to trend upwards providing an expanding market for the company 

  

   

based on company estimates 

  

in 2004 we expect demand to improve in two of our key markets components for new freight cars and new locomotives but we do not expect growth in the aftermarket which represents about 56 of sales 

  

looking beyond 2004 we expect to generate increases in sales and earnings from executing our fourpoint growth strategy see page 5 for more details 

  

   

   

   

   

in 2004 and beyond we will continue to face many challenges including increased costs for raw materials especially steel higher costs for medical and insurance premiums and foreign currency fluctuations in addition we face general economic risks as well as the risk that our customers could curtail spending on new and existing equipment risks associated with our fourpoint growth strategy include the level of investment that customers are willing to make in new technologies developed by the industry and the company and risks inherent in global expansion when necessary we will modify our financial and operating strategies to reflect changes in market conditions and risks 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table shows our consolidated statements of operations for the years indicated 

  

   

2003 compared to 2002 

  

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

  

   

in 2002 we completed fair value assessments of goodwill and wrote down the carrying value of goodwill by 90 million 832 million for the freight group and 68 million for the transit group in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the total impact of the writedown net of taxes was 617 million 

  

the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

  

   

net sales net sales for 2003 increased 217 million or 31 as compared to 2002 the increased sales in the freight group more than offset lower sales in the transit group the freight group’s increased sales reflected higher sales of components for new freight cars and locomotives and commuter locomotives as well as higher international sales industry deliveries of new freight cars for 2003 increased to about 31400 units as compared to about 17700 in 2002 the transit group’s decreased sales were due to the completion of a contract to supply components for new york city subway cars in 2002 and lower aftermarket sales 

  

gross profit gross profit increased to 1895 million in 2003 compared to 1795 million in 2002 gross profit is dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product mix gross profit as a percentage of sales was 264 compared to 258 in 2002 the increase in gross profit percentage is primarily due to higher sales and favorable product mix which more than offset the negative impact of the weakening us dollar versus the canadian dollar 

  

the following table shows our operating expenses 

  

   

operating expenses operating expenses increased 58 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to the writeoff of nonoperating assets of 16 million and higher medical and insurance premiums partially offset by reduced amortization expense amortization expense decreased due to certain intangible assets having been fully amortized 

  

income from operations  income from operations totaled 517 million or 72 of sales in 2003 compared with 475 million or 68 of sales in 2002 higher operating income resulted from increased sales and gross margins but was partially offset by increased operating expenses in 2003 

  

interest expense interest expense decreased 426 in 2003 as compared to 2002 primarily due to a substantial decrease in debt 

  

other expense the company recorded foreign exchange losses from the translation of balance sheet accounts of 28 million and 12 million respectively in 2003 and 2002 

  

income taxes the effective income tax rate was 365 for 2003 and 32 for 2002 the change in the effective tax rate was due to a higher effective state tax rate and increased statutory rates in foreign jurisdictions also increased income has reduced the significance of the favorable impact the company’s utilization of foreign tax credits has on the effective tax rate 

  

net income  net income for 2003 increased 682 million compared with 2002 which included a 617 million net of tax write off of goodwill income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change increased 65 million compared with 2002 the increase was due to increased sales improved margins and lower interest expense 

  

2002 compared to 2001 

  

the following table summarizes the results of operations for the period 

  

   

a number of events occurred over the comparative period that impacted our results of operations and financial condition including 

  

   

   

   

   

merger and restructuring plan in 2001 the company completed a merger and restructuring plan with costs totaling 71 million pretax with approximately 2 million of the charge expensed in 2001 20 million in 2000 and 49 million in 1999 the plan involved the elimination of duplicate facilities and excess capacity operational realignment and related workforce reductions and the evaluation of certain assets as to their perceived ongoing benefit to the company 

  

the following table shows the company’s net sales by business segment 

  

   

net sales  net sales for 2002 decreased 875 million or 112 to 6962 million as compared to the prior period both the freight group and transit group had lower sales the freight group’s decreased sales reflected lower sales of components for new freight cars and locomotives in 2002 industry deliveries of new freight cars decreased to 17717 units as compared to 34247 in the same period in 2001 in 2002 industry deliveries of new locomotives decreased to 969 as compared to 1085 in the same period in 2001 the transit group’s decreased sales were primarily due to the completion of a supply contract for new york city subway cars in the third quarter of 2002 

  

gross profit gross profit decreased to 1795 million or 258 of sales in 2002 compared to 2099 million or 268 of sales in the same period of 2001 the decrease in gross profit and margin is largely attributed to the effect of a decrease in sales volumes which had a negative impact of about 35 million 

  

the following table shows our operating expenses for the period 

  

   

operating expenses operating expenses improved by 239 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 included in operating expenses for 2001 were goodwill amortization of 7 million 93 million for asset writedowns 37 million for merger and restructuring charges and 17 million for severance costs in 2001 the remaining decrease in operating expenses was due to a decrease in selling general and administrative expenses 

  

income from operations income from operations totaled 475 million in 2002 compared with 541 million in 2001 operating income would have been 758 million in 2001 excluding the adjustments discussed in the prior paragraph lower operating income resulted from decreased sales volumes in 2002 see note 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

interest expense interest expense decreased 461 in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily due to a decrease in debt and interest rates 

  

other expense the company recorded foreign exchange losses of 12 million and 17 million respectively in 2002 and 2001 due to exchange rate fluctuations also in 2002 the company wrote down a facility held for sale resulting in a 2 million charge 

  

income taxes the effective income tax rate for 2002 was 32 as compared to 242 in 2001 the rate includes the effect of research and development and foreign tax credits of 772000 and 2 million respectively for 2002 and 2001 excluding these tax credits the rate would have been 35 in both 2002 and 2001 

  

net income  net income decreased 1073 million or 1736 compared with the same period the prior year however adjusting for the 2001 gain on sale of certain businesses of 415 million and the 2002 goodwill writedown of 617 million net of tax net income declined 41 million principally the result of overall lower sales activity in 2002 compared to 2001 

  

income taxes 

  

in the next three years cash outlays for income taxes will be less then income tax expense due to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets which will continue to be amortized for tax purposes the company’s current level of pretax income is sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets as of 2003 the company has utilized all previous federal net operating losses and a portion of the reported federal credits in the amount of 32 million will be realized through a carry back regardless of current income generated the company engages in diverse foreign activity whereby certain funds could be repatriated to the us this would afford the company the opportunity to utilize certain assets more quickly management believes tax planning opportunities exist in various foreign countries that will allow the company to utilize foreign net operating loss carryforwards any tax assets that are uncertain regarding realization have a valuation allowance in the full amount of the asset management believes the remaining assets will be realized in the normal course of business 

  

significant differences between pretax earnings for financial reporting purposes and taxable income for income tax purposes consist of the following 

  

   

liquidity and capital resources 

  

liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facilities with a consortium of commercial banks “credit agreement” the following is a summary of selected cash flow information and other relevant data 

  

   

the following is a reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss 

  

   

ebitda is defined as earnings before deducting interest expense income taxes and depreciation and amortization although ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles management believes that it is useful to an investor in evaluating wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a company’s operating performance and ability to service debt financial covenants in our credit facility include ratios based on ebitda ebitda does not purport to represent cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with 

  

generally accepted accounting principles in addition because ebitda is not calculated identically by all companies the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies management’s discretionary use of funds depicted by ebitda may be limited by working capital debt service and capital expenditure requirements and by restrictions related to legal requirements commitments and uncertainties 

  

operating activities operating cash flow in 2003 was 559 million as compared to 157 million in 2002 working capital remained relatively unchanged as receivables and inventory increased 132 million and accounts payable increased 141 million 

  

operating cash flow in 2002 was 157 million as compared to 1191 million in the same period a year ago working capital decreased 6 million in 2002 as inventory decreased by 16 million while payables and accruals decreased by 10 million cash from operating activities in 2001 was positively impacted by the sale of certain businesses and its corresponding reduction in working capital 

  

during 2002 and 2001 cash outlays for merger and restructuring activities were approximately 25 million and 68 million respectively and are reported as a reduction to cash provided by operating activities also in 2002 30 million was paid in taxes related to the gain on the sale of locomotive aftermarket assets in 2001 the operating cash flow in 2002 excluding the 30 million tax payment from 2001 was approximately 46 million 

  

investing activities in 2003 and 2002 cash used in investing activities was 125 and 108 million respectively consisting almost entirely of capital expenditures net of disposals in 2001 cash provided by investing activities was 2274 million adjusting 2001 for the gross proceeds from the sale of certain businesses for 238 million cash used by investing activities would have been approximately 106 million in 2002 and 2001 we used 17 million and 37 million for certain business acquisitions see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report for further information 

  

capital expenditures for continuing operations were 175 million 141 million and 207 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the majority of capital expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to and replacement of existing equipment 

  

financing activities in 2003 cash provided by financing activities was 92 million compared to cash used by financing activities of 441 million in 2002 

  

in 2003 we issued 150 million of senior notes due in august 2013 “the notes” the notes were issued at par and interest accrues at 6875 and is payable semiannually on january 31 and july 31 of each year commencing on january 31 2004 the proceeds were used to repay debt outstanding under the company’s then existing bank credit agreement and for general corporate purposes 

  

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu with all existing and future senior debt and senior to all our existing and future subordinated indebtedness of the company the indenture under which the notes were issued contains covenants and restrictions which limit among other things the following the incurrence of indebtedness payment of dividends and certain distributions sale of assets change in control mergers and consolidations and the incurrence of liens 

  

in november 2003 we issued common stock in connection with the registration and sale of stock by certain selling shareholders we issued 726900 shares of common stock realizing total proceeds of about 10 million see “prospectus summary — recent development” 

  

cash used for financing activities was 441 million in 2002 versus 2972 million in 2001 during 2002 we reduced longterm debt by 459 million during 2001 we reduced longterm debt by 2983 million we repaid 175 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2002 to take advantage of lower interest rates on our revolving credit agreement historically we have financed the purchase of significant businesses utilizing cash flow generated from operations and amounts available under its credit facilities 

  

the following table shows our outstanding indebtedness at december 31 2003 and 2002 the revolving credit note and other term loan interest rates are variable and dependent on market conditions 

  

   

cash balance at december 31 2003 and 2002 was 703 million and 192 million respectively the financial statements have been prepared based on the terms of the refinanced credit agreement 

  

credit agreements in november 1999 we refinanced the then existing unsecured motivepower credit agreement the “credit agreement” with a consortium of commercial banks this unsecured credit agreement provided a 275 million fiveyear revolving credit facility expiring in november 2004 and a 364day 275 million convertible revolving credit facility maturing in november 2004 in november 2001 we 

  

and the banks negotiated a reduction in the 364day facility to 100 million as a result of the 208 million net of tax cash proceeds from the sale of locomotive businesses to ge in november 2002 we negotiated a further reduction in the 364day facility from 100 million to 95 million in july 2003 we and the banks negotiated a reduction in both facilities to a total of 225 million as a result of the issuance of the senior notes the 225 million facility provided a reduced fiveyear facility of 1672 million and a reduced 364day facility of 578 million in november 2003 we allowed the 578 million 364day facility to expire at december 31 2003 we had available bank borrowing capacity net of 196 million of letters of credit of approximately 1077 million 

  

under the credit agreement we may elect a base rate an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest “libor” a cost of funds rate and a bid rate the base rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 875 to 200 basis points depending on our consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the current margin is 1375 basis points the cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on lasalle bank national association’s then cost of funds under the bid rate option any participating bank may propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds which rate may either be a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor 

  

the credit agreement limits our ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits us from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

  

the credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and “change of control” of the company 

  

credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indices described above the maximum credit agreement borrowings average credit agreement borrowings and weightedaverage contractual interest rate on credit agreement borrowings were 209 million 1293 million and 268 respectively for 2003 to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt we entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts on december 31 2003 the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled 40 million and effectively changed our interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 398 the interest rate swap agreements mature in february 2006 we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties however since only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the counterparties are large financial institutions and we do not anticipate nonperformance 

  

in january 2004 we refinanced the credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this “refinancing credit agreement” currently provides a 175 million fiveyear revolving credit facility expiring in january 2009 under the refinancing credit agreement we may elect a base rate or an interest rate based on the london interbank offered rates of interest “libor” the base rate is the greater of lasalle bank national association’s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 100 to 200 basis points depending on our consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios the current margin is 175 basis points 

  

the refinancing credit agreement limits our ability to declare or pay cash dividends and prohibits us from declaring or making other distributions subject to certain exceptions the refinancing credit agreement contains various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio 

  

the refinancing credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and “change of control” of the company financial covenants include minimum interest coverage ratio maximum total debt to ebitda ratio minimum net worth measurement and capital expenditures limitations the company is in compliance with these measurements and covenants and expects that these measurements will not be any type of limiting factor in executing our operating activities see note 9 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

we believe based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital equipment needs as well as meeting the debt service requirements if our sources of funds were to fail to satisfy our cash requirements we may need to refinance our existing debt or obtain additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives would be 

  

available and in any case such new financing if available would be expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in place 

  

extinguishment of other debt in june 1995 the company issued 100 million of 9375 senior notes due in 2005 the “1995 notes” in january 1999 the company issued an additional 75 million of 9375 senior notes due in 2005 the “1999 notes” the 1995 notes and the 1999 notes were redeemed at par face on july 8 2002 through the use of cash on hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement this redemption resulted in a noncash loss of 19 million relating to a writeoff of deferred debt issuance costs 

  

in july 1998 a subsidiary of the company entered into a 10 year 75 million debt obligation for the purchase of a building used in the company’s operations the debt was repaid in september 2003 

  

effects of inflation 

  

general price inflation has not had a material impact on the company’s results of operations some of our labor contracts contain negotiated salary and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses which would cause our labor cost to automatically increase if inflation were to become significant 

  

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements lease agreements and have certain contingent commitments such as debt guarantees we have grouped these contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements into operating activities financing activities and investing activities in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and arrangements and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information the table below provides a summary of contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2003 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

obligations for operating activities we have not entered into any material longterm noncancelable materials and supply purchase obligations operating leases represent multiyear obligations for rental of facilities and equipment estimated pension funding and post retirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates expected return on longterm assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates benefits paid for pension obligations were 57 million and 56 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively benefits paid for post retirement plans were 21 million and 19 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively we expect these minimum levels of funding to continue in future periods 

  

obligations for financing activities cash requirements for financing activities consist primarily of longterm debt repayments and dividend payments to shareholders we have historically paid quarterly dividends to shareholders subject to quarterly approval by our board of directors currently at a rate of 18 million annually 

  

in 2001 we sold a subsidiary to that unit’s management team as part of the sale we guaranteed approximately 3 million of bank debt of the buyer which was used for the purchase financing in the event that the purchaser cannot repay or refinance the debt without a guarantee by us the subsidiary would be returned to us this debt is due in 2004 we have no reason to believe that this debt will not be repaid or refinanced 

  

obligations for investing activities historically we typically spend approximately 1520 million a year for capital expenditures primarily related to facility expansion efficiency and modernization health and safety and environmental control 

  

we expect annual capital expenditures in the future will be within this range in 2004 we have two properties currently under contract for sale and expect to generate approximately 5 million in sale proceeds once these transactions close

we believe that all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this report including certain statements under “business” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” may constitute forwardlooking statements we have based these forwardlooking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events although we believe that our assumptions made in connection with the forwardlooking statements are reasonable we cannot assure you that our assumptions and expectations are correct

statements in this 10k apply only as of the date on which such statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update any statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives environmental matters warranty reserves the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment proceeds on assets to be sold pensions and other postretirement benefits and tax matters management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company’s financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and environmental matters can be found in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note 2 in the “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

  

in 2002 we adopted the new standard of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives the cumulative effect adjustment recognized on january 1 2002 upon adoption of the new standard was a charge of 617 million after tax also in 2002 amortization ceased for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives total amortization expense for intangible assets recognized was 34 million in 2003 and 4 million in 2002 additionally goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be tested for impairment at least annually the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value including goodwill we use a combination of a guideline public company market approach and a discounted cash flow model “dcf model” to determine the current fair value of the business a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecasted operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volume and pricing costs to produce and working capital changes management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values of its business are estimated however actual fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

  

the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available evidence 

  

other areas of significant judgments and estimates include the liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits these amounts are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of return is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets 

  

as a global company wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax jurisdictions in which it operates management uses its best judgment in the determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual liability differs from the recorded amount management does not believe that such a charge would be material

in the ordinary course of business we are exposed to risks that increases in interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its variablerate debt after considering the effects of interest rate swaps further described below our variable rate debt represents 0 of total longterm debt at december 31 2003 and 66 in 2002 management has entered into payfixed receivevariable interest rate swap contracts that mitigates the impact of variablerate debt interest rate increases at december 31 2003 an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not reduce our annual earnings we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 133 and as amended by sfas 138 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” effective january 1 2001 in the application we have concluded that our swap contracts qualify for “special cash flow hedge accounting” which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet see note 21 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report this fluctuation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition results of operations and liquidity 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

we occasionally enter into several types of financial instruments for the purpose of managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in countries in which we have significant operations as of december 31 2003 we had several such instruments outstanding to hedge currency rate fluctuation in 2004 

  

we entered into foreign currency options and forward contracts to reduce the impact of changes in currency exchange rates a currency option gives us the right but not the obligation to exchange currency at a predetermined exchange rate either on a specific date or within a specific period of time forward contracts are agreements with a counterparty to exchange two distinct currencies at a set exchange rate for delivery on a set date at some point in the future there is no exchange of funds until the delivery date at the delivery date we can either take delivery of the currency or settle on a net basis all outstanding forward contracts and option agreements are for the sale of us dollars usd and the purchase of canadian dollars cad as of december 31 2003 we had outstanding option agreements with a notional value of 105 million cad resulting in the recording of a current asset of 270000 and an increase in comprehensive income of 171000 net of tax and has forward contracts with a notional value of 135 million cad resulting in the 

  

recording of a current asset of 100000 and an increase in comprehensive income of 64000 net of tax 

  

subsequent to december 31 2003 the company entered into additional forward contracts to hedge its exposure to canadian currency risk including the forwards outstanding at the end of 2003 the forward contracts currently have a total notional value of 83 million cad or 62 million usd with an average exchange rate of 0747 usd per 1 cad 

  

we are also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2003 approximately 69 of wabtec’s net sales are in the united states 9 in canada 1 in mexico and 21 in other international locations primarily europe see note 20 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” included in part iv item 15 of this report 

  

our market risk exposure is not substantially different from our exposure at december 31 2002

general

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation does business as wabtec
corporation all references to we our us the company and wabtec
refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation a delaware
corporation and its subsidiaries

wabtec is one of north americas largest providers of valueadded
technologybased equipment and services for the rail industry the companys
products can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and
passenger transit vehicles the company is based in wilmerding pa and has
4409 full time employees at facilities throughout north america and around the
world

the company believes that it maintains a market share of 50 or more in north
america for its primary brakingrelated equipment and leading market shares in
north america for most of its other principal products wabtec also sells
products in europe africa australia south america and asia the companys
products which are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce
maintenance costs for customers include brakes for locomotives freight cars
and passenger transit vehicles electronic controls and monitors heat
exchangers and cooling systems switcher and commuter locomotives couplers
door systems and draft gears the company aggressively pursues technological
advances for both new product development and product enhancements

management and insiders of the company own approximately 15 of wabtecs
outstanding shares with the remaining shares held by investment companies and
individuals executive management incentives focus on earnings cash flow and
working capital targets in order to align management interests with those of
outside shareholders

the company was formed from the november 1999 merger of westinghouse air brake
company wabco and motivepower industries inc motivepower wabco has
its origin in a business founded by george westinghouse in 1869

in 2001 wabtec sold certain assets to ge transportation systems gets for 238
million in cash the assets sold primarily included locomotive aftermarket
products and services for which wabtec was not the original equipment
manufacturer all of these assets had been part of motivepower the results for
these businesses along with other businesses that the company has decided to
exit are classified as discontinued operations throughout this report

industry overview

the company provides products and services primarily for the global freight rail
and passenger transit industries with about 54 percent of its sales to the
aftermarket about 85 percent of the companys sales are in north america the
companys primary customers are freight and passenger railroads and
manufacturers of transportation vehicles such as locomotives freight cars
subway cars and buses as such the companys operating results are strongly
influenced by the level of activity financial condition and capital spending
plans of the global railroad industry rail traffic in terms of both freight
and passengers is a key factor underlying the demand for the companys
products particularly in the aftermarket government investment in public rail
transportation also plays a significant role additionally railroads
continuously seek to increase the efficiency and productivity of their rail
operations to improve profitability which results in the purchase of new
moreefficient equipment

to a large degree market conditions in the us freight railroad industry are
dependent on the us economy with the us economy experiencing a recession in
2001 and slow growth in 2002 railroads have faced difficult market conditions
in 2002 revenue tonmiles a main indicator of rail activity defined as weight
times distance traveled by class i railroads increased only about 1 percent
and car loadings decreased about 1 percent compared to 2001 this level of
activity resulted in railroads deferring maintenance on certain locomotives and
freight cars in their fleets which in turn reduced aftermarket sales for the
company the company expects that railroads may return to a more typical pattern
of maintenance spending as the us economy strengthens and the level of
activity in the industry begins to show consistent increases

the company is also affected by the level of activity in the original equipment
markets for new locomotives and freight cars currently the active locomotive
fleet in the north american market numbers approximately 33000 units including
heavyhaul freight locomotives commuter locomotives and

                                        2
page

lowerhorsepower shorthaul and terminal locomotives the average number of new
locomotives delivered in each of the past 10 years was about 1000 annually the
introduction of new technologies has enabled the railroads to purchase more
efficient and powerful locomotives to increase productivity many of the
companys products help to provide this greater productivity in 2002
deliveries of new heavyhaul locomotives were 940 down from 1085 in 2001 in
2003 the company expects the industry to deliver about 700 new locomotives

currently the active freight car fleet in north america numbers approximately
13 million the average number of new freight cars delivered in each of the
past 10 years was about 50000 annually in both 1998 and 1999 however the
industry delivered about 75000 cars as railroads and leasing companies
increased purchases to help alleviate traffic congestion in the us rail system
following several railroad mergers and to meet increased demand as the us
economy began to slow down and the congestion abated railroads and leasing
companies reduced new car purchases as a result in 2002 new freight car
deliveries were substantially below the 10year average for the second
consecutive year 17736 compared to 34247 in 2001 the company expects the
industry to deliver about 22000 new freight cars in 2003 again well below
average and below what the company believes is normal replacement demand of
about 40000 units the company believes that the delivery rate for the next
several years may increase as railroads and leasing companies recognize the
benefit of new technology and specialty cars designed to increase efficiency and
productivity

the company believes that its products and services offer railroads the ability
to reduce costs and increase productivity to meet their efficiency goals
however the company operates in a highly competitive environment and there can
be no assurance that increased rail traffic higher fleet utilization or other
economically favorable industry conditions will benefit the company

demand for passenger transit original equipment and aftermarket products is
driven by the replacement building andor expansion programs of transit
authorities these programs are funded in part by us federal and state
government programs the most important of which has been tea21 which is
expected to provide up to 42 billion nationally subject to appropriations for
transitrelated infrastructure through 2003 during 2003 the us federal
government is expected to pass new legislation outlining transportation
infrastructure funding for the next several years the level of funding will
have an impact on the capital spending plans of transit authorities in recent
years tea21 funding has resulted in strong demand for new passenger transit
vehicles particularly in new york city which owns about 40 percent of the
transit vehicles in north america the average delivery rate for new transit
vehicles in the past 10 years was about 500 units annually in 2002 the
industry delivered 1230 new rail transit vehicles compared to 1072 in 2001
in 2003 the company expects deliveries to be about 700 units reflecting the
completion of a major order by the metropolitan transportation authority of new
york city in late 2002 new york city placed another major order for new subway
cars with deliveries commencing in 2005 as a result the company expects the
transit vehicle delivery rate to be in the range of 500800 units for the next
several years while aftermarket spending is expected to be lower in 2003 as
budget cutbacks and a decrease in ridership levels have a negative shortterm
impact it could increase in future years due to normal wear

business segments and products

approximately 46 of net sales in 2002 were directly to original equipment
manufacturers oems of locomotives railway freight cars and passenger transit
vehicles we believe that our substantial installed base of products to the oems
is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to
the aftermarket because endusers often look to purchase safety and
performancerelated replacement parts from the original supplier as such the
majority of the companys sales were derived from the sale of aftermarket
replacement parts repair services and overhaul work purchased by operators of
rail vehicles such as railroads transit authorities utilities and leasing
companies collectively end users or the aftermarket

we provide products and services through two principal business segments the
freight group and the transit group

freight group  includes components and services for new and existing freight
cars and locomotives revenues are derived from oem and aftermarket sales
including repairs and services freight group revenues as a percentage of total
net sales were 64 63 and 66 in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively

                                        3
page

specific product lines within the freight group are

 freight car products and services  we manufacture sell and service air
  brake equipment draft gears hand brakes slack adjusters and composite
  brake shoes blocks and pads for the oem freight car market and for the
  aftermarket in the form of parts and repair services net sales per typical
  freight car can vary considerably based upon the type and purpose of the
  freight platform with articulated or intermodal cars generally having the
  highest wabtec product content the companys traditional freight products
  include the abdx freight brake valve the mark series draft gears hand brakes
  and slack adjusters and sac1tmarticulated coupler

 locomotive products and services  we manufacture sell and service air brake
  equipment gearing compressors air dryers slack adjusters brake cylinders
  and monitoring and control equipment for the locomotive oem and aftermarket

we also manufacture switcher and commuter locomotives and provide maintenance
support for these locomotives the locomotive product line also includes
manufacturing and distribution of replacement new and remanufactured components
and parts for regional railroads as a supplier of proprietary components for
locomotives manufactured by the electromotive division of general motors
corporation emd and the ge transportation systems unit of general electric
company wabtec also provides these components in the aftermarket directly to
railroad customers

demand for aftermarket components is influenced by rail traffic activity and the
maintenance requirements of the railroads

 heat exchangers  we manufacture sell and service heat exchangers and
  cooling equipment for the locomotive oem and aftermarket and the industrial
  nonrail oem and aftermarket

 electronics  we manufacture sell and service highquality electronics for
  the railroads in the form of onboard systems and braking for locomotives and
  freight cars we are an industry leader in insulating or hardening
  electronic components to protect them from severe conditions including
  extreme temperatures and highshock vibration environments our new product
  development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and
  controls and over the past several years we introduced a number of
  significant new products including the epicr electronic brake
  electronically controlled pneumatic ecp freight brake positive train
  control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning
  communication protocols powerlinktm train traxtm trainlinktm train
  sentry iiir fuellinktm and armadillotm

transit group  includes products and services for passenger transit vehicles
typically subway cars and buses revenues are derived primarily from oem and
aftermarket component parts sales revenues from the transit group as a
percentage of total net sales were 36 37 and 34 in 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively

we manufacture sell and service electronic brake equipment pneumatic control
equipment air compressors tread brakes and disc brakes couplers collection
equipment monitoring systems wheels climate control and door equipment and
other components for passenger transit vehicles

substantially all of our principal passenger transit products are engineered to
customer specifications consequently there is less standardization among these
products than with the freight group products the transit group also focuses on
new product development and has introduced a number of new products during the
past several years including decelostattm sw 800tm twin cushiontm
waughmattm and classtm

consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this report

strategy

the companys goal is to assist their primary customers the railroads gain
market share by providing products designed to increase productivity safety and
reliability in addition the company is committed to building shareholder value
by executing the following fourpoint plan

focus on increasing sales to manufacturers of original equipment  the company
currently serves as a tier i supplier to oems in certain markets but it desires
to increase business with these customers to achieve this goal the company
plans to focus on integrating its electrical pneumatic and mechanical
technologies across business units and combining them as a complete package
increasingly customers will be able to purchase complete assemblies from
                                        4
page

wabtec rather than purchasing individual components from multiple suppliers
this can improve reliability and reduce product integration issues the company
expects this capability to strengthen its position against competitors that do
not have the breadth and depth of wabtecs product line

expand globally  we believe that international markets represent a significant
opportunity for future growth our net sales outside of the united states
comprised approximately 24 26 and 24 of total sales in 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part iv item 15 of this report we intend to increase our existing
international sales through acquisitions direct sales of products through our
subsidiaries and licensees and joint ventures with railway suppliers having a
strong presence in their local markets we are specifically targeting markets
that operate significant fleets of usstyle locomotives and freight cars

accelerate new product development  we will continue to emphasize research and
development to create new and improved products to increase our market share and
profitability we are focusing on technological advances especially in the
areas of electronics braking products and other onboard equipment as a means
of new product growth in addition we seek to provide customers with
incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits for relatively
low investments

implement lean principles to improve efficiency and quality  we intend to
build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the
industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer
responsiveness through the wabtec quality and performance system qps we
are dedicated to lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement
across all phases of our business our qps includes employeedirected
initiatives through kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept used to
continuously improve quality lead time and productivity and to reduce costs
these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product quality and
customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to
market developments

backlog

the company maintains a backlog of customer orders although a majority of its
revenues are derived from aftermarket sales which typically carry lead times of
less than 30 days as such the backlog is a more important indicator of
original equipment sales than aftermarket activity

the companys contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation
provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of
designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these
and other reasons completion of the companys backlog may be delayed or
cancelled and backlog should not be relied upon as an indicator of the companys
future performance the railroad industry in general has historically been
subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of
alternative modes of transportation

the backlog of customer orders as of december 31 2002 and december 31 2001
and the expected year of completion is as follows

engineering and development

consistent with its strategy of using technology to develop new products the
company is actively engaged in a variety of engineering and development
activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 the
company incurred costs of approximately 336 million 332 million and 323
million respectively on product development and improvement activities
exclusive of manufacturing support such expenditures represented
approximately 48 42 and 4 of net sales for the same

                                        5
page

periods respectively the increase in the percentage of sales spent on
engineering and development illustrates the companys commitment to new product
development from time to time the company conducts specific research projects
in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product
suppliers

the companys engineering and development program is largely focused upon train
control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on the application of
electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic actuation of braking
has long been a part of the companys transit product line but
interchangeability connectivity and durability have presented problems to the
industry in establishing electronics in freight railway applications efforts
are proceeding in the enhancement of the major components for existing
hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies

the company uses an electronic product development system epds to develop and
monitor all new product programs the system requires the product development
team to follow a consistent methodology throughout the development process from
concept to launch to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and
internal profitability targets

intellectual property

the company has numerous us patents patent applications pending and
trademarks as well as foreign patents and trademarks throughout the world the
company also relies on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual
property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to
establish and protect its proprietary rights in its intellectual property

certain trademarks among them the name wabcor were acquired or licensed by
the company from american standard inc in 1990 at the time of the companys
acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of
american standard the 1990 acquisition

the company is a party as licensor and licensee to a variety of license
agreements the company does not believe that any single license agreement is of
material importance to its business as a whole

the company and sab wabco holdings bv sab wabco entered into a license
agreement the sab license on december 31 1993 pursuant to which sab wabco
granted the company a license to the intellectual property and knowhow related
to the manufacturing and marketing of certain disc brakes tread brakes and low
noise and resilient wheel products sab wabco is a former affiliate of the
company both having been owned by the same parent in the early 1990s in 2002
sab wabco was purchased by vestar capital partners which also owns stock in
wabtec the sab license expires december 31 2003 but may be renewed for
additional oneyear terms the company believes that the patents which are
covered by this license will expire prior to or concurrently with the license
expiration

the company has issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes
and related products in japan nabco and mitsubishi electric company the
company believes that each of these licensees has a japanese market share of
approximately 50 both licenses were renewed for additional fiveyear terms in
2000 nabco has been a licensee for over 78 years the licensees pay an annual
license fee to the company and also assist the company by acting as liaisons
with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north
america the company believes that its relationships with these licensees have
been beneficial to the companys core transit business and customer
relationships in north america

customers

a few customers within each business segment represent a significant portion of
the companys net sales one customer in the transit group represented 11 of
consolidated sales in 2002 and 2001 the loss of a few key customers within the
companys freight and transit groups could have an adverse effect on the
companys financial condition results of operations and liquidity

competition

the company operates in a competitive marketplace price competition is strong
and the existence of costconscious purchasers of a limited number has
historically limited wabtecs ability to increase prices in addition to price
competition is based on product performance and technological leadership
quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support the companys
principal competitors vary to some extent across its principal product lines
but most competitors are smaller privately held companies within north

employees

at december 31 2002 the company had 4409 full time employees approximately
36 of whom are unionized a majority of the employees subject to collective
bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements are
generally effective through 2003 2004 and 2005

the company considers its relations with its employees and union representation
to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be
favorable to the company

regulation

in the course of its operations the company is subject to various regulations
of agencies and other entities in the united states these include principally
the federal railroad administration fra and the association of american
railroads aar

the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to
railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for
freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce

the aar promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and
design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in
interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and
component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the
united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval
processes

as a result of these regulations and regulations in other countries in which the
company derives its revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a
component manufacturer and for products we sell

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

overview

in november 2001 wabtec sold certain assets to ge transportation systems for
238 million in cash the assets sold primarily included locomotive aftermarket
products and services for which wabtec was not the original equipment
manufacturer the results for these businesses along with several other small
noncore businesses that the company has decided to exit are classified as
discontinued operations throughout this report

net sales of ongoing operations decreased by 112 from 7837 million in 2001
to 6962 million in 2002 the major causes for the change were decreases in
component sales due to the continuation of the weak freight market a downturn
in the locomotive overhaul market and the completion of a major transit contract
in the third quarter of 2002

without nonrecurring and nonoperating items noted below earnings from
continuing operations were 175 million or 040 per diluted share for 2002
and 211 million or 049 per diluted share for 2001 the results for 2002
include a 617 million net of tax write off of goodwill in accordance with
sfas no 142 a 12 million net of tax loss on early extinguishment of debt
and 126000 of loss from discontinued operations the 2001 results include
478 million of income from discontinued operations including a 415 million
gain net of tax on the sale of assets to ge transportation systems noted above
and writedown of certain businesses classified as discontinued operations a
93 million charge for asset writedowns a 37 million restructuringrelated
charge a 685000 gain on the disposition of excess facilities a 2 million
research and development tax credit and a 17 million charge for severance
costs related to a 10 percent salary workforce reduction

merger and restructuring plan

in 2001 the company completed a merger and restructuring plan with charges
totaling 71 million pretax with approximately 2 million of the charge
expensed in 2001 20 million in 2000 and 49 million in 1999 the plan involved
the elimination of duplicate facilities and excess capacity operational
realignment and related workforce reductions and the evaluation of certain
assets as to their perceived ongoing benefit to the company

as of december 31 2002 647000 of the merger and restructuring charge still
remained as accrued on the balance sheet as part of other accrued liabilities
the accrual on the balance sheet is discussed in greater detail in note 24 of
notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of
this report

the company began and completed a new restructuring plan for the transit rail
business in 2001 the restructuring plan involved operational realignment and
related workforce reductions the charges in 2001 for the restructuring plan
move totaled 2 million pretax 2002 operations still included much of the cost
of integration in normal operations

the 2 million charge in 2001 included costs associated with relocating several
production operations from chicago to montreal including severance costs for
approximately 103 employees

  net sales  696195   783698
                                


net sales for 2002 decreased 875 million or 112 to 6962 million as
compared to the prior period both the freight group and transit group had lower
sales the freight groups decreased sales reflected lower sales of components
for new freight cars and locomotives in 2002 industry deliveries of new
freight cars decreased to 17736 units as compared to 34247 in the same period
in 2001 in 2002 industry deliveries of new locomotives decreased to 940 as
compared to 1085 in the same period in 2001 the transit groups decreased
sales were primarily due to the completion of a supply contract for new york
city subway cars in the third quarter of 2002

gross profit decreased to 1795 million or 258 of sales in 2002 compared to
2099 million or 268 of sales in the same period of 2001 gross profit is
dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product
mix the decrease in gross profit and margin is largely attributed to the effect
of a decrease in sales volumes approximately 35 million in gross profit the
resulting favorable balance is principally a result of cost reductions

operating expenses improved by 23 million in 2002 as compared to 2001 after
excluding goodwill amortization due to the required adoption of financial
accounting standard 142 of 7 million 93 million for asset writedowns 37
million for merger and restructuring charges and 17 million for severance
costs in 2001 the decrease in operating expenses was due to a decrease in
selling general and administrative expenses

income from operations totaled 475 million in 2002 compared with 541 million
in 2001 operating income would have been 758 million in 2001 excluding the
above adjustments shown in the prior paragraph lower operating income resulted
from decreased sales volumes in 2002 see note 21 of notes to consolidated
financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this report

interest expense decreased 516 in 2002 as compared to 2001 primarily due to a
decrease in debt and interest rates debt net of cash and equivalents was
1759 million at december 31 2002 versus 1879 million at the end of 2001

the company recorded foreign exchange losses of 12 million and 17 million
respectively in 2002 and 2001 due to the continued strength of the dollar also
in 2002 the company wrote down a facility held for sale resulting in a 2
million charge these items were reported as other income expense

the effective income tax rate for 2002 was 32 as compared to 242 in 2001 the
company expects the ongoing rate to be approximately 3536 the 2002 rate
includes the effect of research and development and foreign tax credits
772000 the 2001 rate includes the effect of substantial research and
development tax credits 2 million excluding these tax credits the rate
would have been 35 in both 2002 and 2001

  net sales  783698   811178
                                


net sales decreased 275 million or 34 to 7837 million in 2001 from 8112
million in 2000 this overall decrease was primarily attributable to decreased
north american oem freight car and locomotive component sales volumes and lower
locomotive overhauls all within the freight group sales volumes within the
freight group reflected a softening oem market for freight cars with 34247
freight cars delivered in 2001 compared to 55821 in 2000 partially offsetting
these decreases were increases in transit group sales due to increased
shipments under the new york city mta contract

gross profit decreased to 2099 million or 268 of sales in 2001 compared to
2357 million or 291 of sales in the same period of 2000 gross margin is
dependent on a number of factors including pricing sales volume and product
mix the decrease in gross profit and margin is largely attributed to the effect
of

                                        15
page

a decrease in sales volumes approximately 11 million in gross profit the
balance is principally a result of changes to the sales mix primarily from a
drop in the freight group of 8 offset by an increase in the transit group of 5
and overall pricing pressures in many product lines

total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 199 in 2001 and
195 in the same period a year ago after excluding 93 million for asset
writedowns 37 million for merger and restructuring charges and 17 million
for severance costs in 2001 and 182 million for 2000 merger and restructuring
charges operating expenses would have been 18 and 172 of net sales
respectively without the above adjustments operating expenses would have
increased 15 million in 2001 as compared to 2000

income from operations totaled 541 million in 2001 compared with 778 million
in 2000 after excluding the merger and restructuringrelated charges in both
periods and the asset writedowns and severance costs in 2001 and a 2 million
legal settlement in 2000 operating income would have been 687 million and
100 million in 2001 and 2000 respectively lower adjusted operating income
resulted from decreased sales volumes in the freight group and changes in
product mix see note 21 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part iv item 15 of this report

interest expense decreased 232 to 335 million in 2001 from 436 million in
2000 debt net of cash and equivalents was 1879 million at december 31 2001
versus 5341 million at the end of 2000 the decrease in interest expense is
primarily due to the lower debt amount as a result of working capital management
and the sale proceeds from gets received in november 2001 with taxes on the
gain deferred to 2002

in 2001 the company recorded foreign exchange losses of 17 million in
february 2000 the company disposed of its transit electrification product line
for 55 million in cash and recognized a gain of 44 million these items were
reported as other income expense

the effective income tax rate for 2001 was 242 as compared to 494 in 2000
the 2001 rate includes the effect of substantial research and development tax
credits 2 million excluding this tax credit the rate would have been 35
the 2000 rate includes the effect of the onetime noncash writeoff of the
deferred tax asset 51 million relating to the termination of the 1995
established esop excluding this effect the rate would be 36

liquidity and capital resources

liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under the
companys credit facilities with a consortium of commercial banks credit

operating cash flow in 2002 was 157 million as compared to 1191 million in
the same period a year ago working capital decreased 6 million in 2002 as
inventory decreased by 16 million while payables and accruals decreased by 10
million in 2001 working capital decreased significantly primarily due to a
decrease in accounts receivable and inventory during 2002 and 2001 cash
outlays for merger and restructuring activities were approximately 25 million
and 68 million respectively and are reported as a reduction to cash provided
by operating activities also in 2002 30 million was paid in taxes related to
the gain on the sale of locomotive aftermarket assets to gets in 2001 the
operating cash flow in 2002 excluding the 30 million tax payment from 2001 was
approximately 46 million

cash used by investing activities was 108 million versus cash provided by
investing activities of 2274 million a year ago adjusting the 2001 amount by
the sale of businesses to ge for 238 million cash used by investing activities
would have been approximately 106 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 the company
used 17 million 37 million and 650000 respectively for certain business
acquisitions see note 5 of notes to consolidated financial statements

tures for continuing operations were 141 million 207 million and 232
million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the majority of capital
expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to existing equipment and
replacement of existing equipment

cash used for financing activities was 441 million in 2002 versus 2972
million in 2001 during 2002 the company reduced longterm debt by 459
million during 2001 the company reduced longterm debt by 2983 million the
company repaid 175 million of senior notes in the third quarter of 2002 to take
advantage of lower interest rates on the companys revolving credit agreement
historically the company has financed the purchase of significant businesses
utilizing cash flow generated from operations and amounts available under its
credit facilities

ebitda is defined as earnings before deducting interest expense income taxes
and depreciation and amortization although ebitda is not a measure of
performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles management believes that it is useful to an investor in evaluating
wabtec because it is widely used as a measure to evaluate a companys operating
performance and ability to service debt financial covenants in our credit
facility include ratios based on ebitda ebitda does not purport to represent
cash generated by operating activities and should not be considered in isolation
or as substitute for measures of performance in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in addition because ebitda is not calculated
identically by all companies the presentation here may not be comparable to
other similarly titled measures of other companies managements discretionary
use of funds depicted by ebitda may be limited by working capital debt service
and capital expenditure requirements and by restrictions related to legal
requirements commitments and uncertainties

credit agreement

in november 1999 wabtec refinanced the then existing unsecured motivepower
credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this unsecured credit
agreement currently provides a 275 million fiveyear revolving credit facility
expiring in november 2004 and a 364day 95 million convertible revolving credit
facility maturing in november 2004 with an annual renewal in november 2003 in
november 2001 the company and the banks negotiated a reduction in the 364day
facility from 213 million to 100 million as a result of the 208 million net
of tax cash proceeds from the sale of locomotive businesses to ge in november
2002 the company negotiated a further reduction in the 364day facility from
100 million to 95 million at december 31 2002 the company had available
bank borrowing capacity net of letters of credit of approximately 159
million

under the credit agreement the company may elect a base rate an interest rate
based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor a cost of
funds rate and a bid rate the base rate is the greater of lasalle bank national
associations prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per
annum the libor rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 875 to
200 basis points depending on the companys consolidated total indebtedness to
cash flow ratios the current margin is 150 basis points the cost of funds rate
is a fluctuating interest rate based on lasalle bank national associations then
cost of funds under the bid rate option any participating bank may propose the
interest rate at which it will lend funds which rate may either be a fixed rate
or a floating rate based on libor

                                        17

the credit agreement limits the companys ability to declare or pay cash
dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other
distributions subject to certain exceptions the credit agreement contains
various other covenants and restrictions including the following limitations
incurrence of additional indebtedness mergers consolidations and sales of
assets and acquisitions additional liens sale and leasebacks permissible
investments loans and advances certain debt payments capital expenditures
and imposes a minimum interest expense coverage ratio and a maximum debt to cash
flow ratio

the credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment
defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material
respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the
company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and
change of control of the company

credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to the indexes
described above the maximum credit agreement borrowings average credit
agreement borrowings and weightedaverage contractual interest rate on credit
agreement borrowings was 2177 million 1337 million and 331 respectively
for 2002 to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this
variablerate debt the company entered into interest rate swaps which
effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowings
during the term of the swap contracts on december 31 2002 the notional value
of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled 60 million and effectively changed
the companys interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 87 the
interest rate swap agreements mature in june 2003 the company is exposed to
credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties however since
only the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less
than the notional amount the counterparties are large financial institutions
and the company does not anticipate nonperformance

9 38 senior notes

in june 1995 the company issued 100 million of 9375 senior notes due in 2005
the 1995 notes in january 1999 the company issued an additional 75
million of 9375 senior notes due in 2005 the 1999 notes the 1995 notes and
the 1999 notes are collectively the notes the 1999 notes were issued at a
premium resulting in an effective rate of 85 the terms of the 1995 notes and
the 1999 notes were substantially the same and the 1995 notes and the 1999
notes were issued pursuant to indentures that were substantially the same the
notes were redeemed at par face on july 8 2002 through the use of cash on
hand and additional borrowings under the credit agreement this redemption
resulted in an extraordinary noncash loss of 12 million net of tax relating
to a writeoff of deferred debt issuance costs see note 25 of notes to
consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15 of this report

industrial revenue bond

in july 1998 a subsidiary of the company entered into a 10 year 75 million
debt obligation that bears an interest rate of 55 and is payable in monthly
principal and interest installments the proceeds of the bond provided financing
for the purchase of a building used in the companys operations

principal repayments of outstanding loan balances are due at various intervals
until maturity see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part iv item 15 of this report

the company believes based on current levels of operations and forecasted
earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund its working capital
and capital equipment needs as well as meeting the debt service requirements if
the companys sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the companys cash
requirements the company may need to refinance its existing debt or obtain
additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives
would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be
expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in
place the company currently expects to refinance and replace its existing bank
facility at least twelve months prior to its november 2004 expiration

effects of inflation

general price inflation has not had a material impact on the companys results
of operations some of the companys labor contracts contain negotiated salary
and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses
which would cause the companys cost to automatically increase if inflation were
to become significant

critical accounting policies

the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgments estimates
and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses areas of uncertainty that require
judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives
environmental matters the testing of goodwill and other intangibles for
impairment proceeds on assets to be sold pensions and other postretirement
benefits and tax matters management uses historical experience and all
available information to make these

                                        19
page

judgments and estimates and actual results will inevitably differ from those
estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the companys financial
statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management
believes that managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations mda and the financial statements and related footnotes
provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the
judgments and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and
environmental matters can be found in the notes to consolidated financial
statements included in part iv item 15 of this report

a summary of the companys significant accounting policies is included in note 2
in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv item 15
of this report management believes that the application of these policies on a
consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial
statements with useful and reliable information about the companys operating
results and financial condition

in 2002 wabtec adopted the new standard of accounting for goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives the cumulative effect adjustment
recognized on january 1 2002 upon adoption of the new standard was a charge
of 617 million after tax also in 2002 amortization ceased for goodwill and
intangible assets with indefinite lives total amortization expense recognized
was 53 million in 2002 13 million in 2001 and 126 million in 2000
additionally goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles are required to be
tested for impairment at least annually the evaluation of impairment involves
comparing the current fair value of the business to the recorded value
including goodwill the company uses a combination of a guideline public
company market approach and a discounted cash flow model dcf model to
determine the current fair value of the business a number of significant
assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to
forecasted operating cash flows including markets and market share sales
volume and pricing costs to produce and working capital changes management
considers historical experience and all available information at the time the
fair values of its business are estimated however actual fair values that
could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to
evaluate the impairment of goodwill

other areas of significant judgments and estimates include the liabilities and
expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits these amounts are
determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant
assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability
the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to
the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and
mortality the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined
considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be
used to settle the obligations of the plan the longterm rate of return is
estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and
projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average
market value of assets

the recent declines in equity markets and interest rates have had a negative
impact on wabtecs pension plan liability and fair value of plan assets as a
result the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan
assets at the end of 2002 which resulted in a 71 million net of tax charge
to other comprehensive loss in the fourth quarter

as a global company wabtec records an estimated liability or benefit for income
and other taxes based on what it determines will likely be paid in various tax
jurisdictions in which it operates management uses its best judgment in the
determination of these amounts however the liabilities ultimately realized and
paid are dependent on various matters including the resolution of the tax audits
in the various affected tax jurisdictions and may differ from the amounts
recorded an adjustment to the estimated liability would be recorded through
income in the period in which it becomes probable that the amount of the actual
liability differs from the recorded amount management does not believe that
such a charge would be material



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in
interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its
variablerate debt after considering the effects of interest rate swaps
further described below the companys variable rate debt represents 66 of
total longterm debt at december 31 2002 and 1 in 2001 management

has entered into payfixed receivevariable interest rate swap contracts that
partially mitigate the impact of variablerate debt interest rate increases at
december 31 2002 an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates
would reduce the companys annual earnings by 882000 assuming no additional
intervention strategies by management

the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
133 and as amended by sfas 138 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities effective january 1 2001 in the application the company
has concluded that its swap contracts qualify for special cash flow hedge
accounting which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding
adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet see note 22 of

item 1 business

general

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation does business as wabtec
corporation all references to we our us the company and wabtec
refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation a delaware
corporation and its subsidiaries the company was formed from the november 1999
merger of westinghouse air brake company wabco and motivepower industries
inc motivepower wabco has its origin in a business founded by george
westinghouse in 1869 the 1999 merger was accounted for as a poolingof
interests accordingly prior period consolidated financial statements have
been restated giving effect to this transaction as if it had occurred as of the
beginning of the earliest period presented the discussions that follow are
based on the combined companies for each year

in november 2001 wabtec sold certain assets to ge transportation systems gets
for 240 million in cash the assets sold primarily included locomotive
aftermarket products and services for which wabtec is not the original equipment
manufacturer all of these assets had been part of motivepower the results for
these businesses along with other businesses that the company has decided to
exit are classified as discontinued operations throughout this report prior
period results were restated for the discontinued operations

wabtec is one of north americas largest providers of valueadded
technologybased equipment and services for the rail industry the companys
products can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and
passenger transit vehicles the company is based in wilmerding pa and has
4436 full time employees at facilities throughout north america and around the
world

the company believes that it maintains a market share of 50 or more in north
america for its primary brakingrelated equipment and significant market shares
in north america for its other principal products wabtec also sells products in
europe africa australia south america and asia the companys products which
are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance
costs for customers include the following air brakes electronic controls and
monitors cooling equipment switcher and commuter locomotives couplers door
controls and draft gears the company aggressively pursues technological
advances for both new product development and product enhancements

management and insiders of the company own approximately 23 of wabtecs
outstanding shares with the remaining shares held by investment companies and
individuals executive management incentives are designed to align management
interests with those of outside shareholders by focusing on cash flow generation
and working capital reduction

industry overview

the company provides products and services primarily for the global freight rail
and passenger transit industries with about 50 percent of its sales to the
aftermarket about 85 percent of the companys sales are in north america the
companys primary customers are freight and passenger railroads and
manufacturers of transportation vehicles such as locomotives freight cars
subway cars and buses as such the companys operating results are strongly
influenced by the level of activity financial condition and capital spending
plans of the global railroad industry rail traffic in terms of both freight
and passengers is a key factor underlying the demand for the companys
products particularly in the aftermarket government investment in public rail
transportation also plays a significant role additionally railroads
continuously seek to increase the efficiency and productivity of their rail
operations to improve profitability which has resulted in the purchase of new
moreefficient equipment

in 2001 us freight railroads faced difficult market conditions due to the
slowdown in the us economy revenue tonmiles a main indicator of rail
activity defined as weight times distance traveled by class i railroads
increased only about 1 percent and car loadings decreased about 1 percent
compared to 2000 the average capacity per car continues to increase so that
more weight can be carried in each car in response to these difficult market
conditions railroads reduced purchases of new locomotives and freight cars and
continued low maintenance spending on their existing fleets these actions
reduced demand for the companys products and services particularly in its
highermargin businesses the company expects that railroads will return to a
more typical pattern of maintenance spending when the level of activity in the
industry begins to show consistent increases as the us economy strengthens

                                        2

currently the active locomotive fleet in the north american market numbers
approximately 33000 units including heavyhaul freight locomotives commuter
locomotives and lowerhorsepower shorthaul and terminal locomotives the
average number of new locomotives delivered in each of the past 10 years was
about 1000 annually but railroads have exceeded this figure in recent years
as the introduction of new technologies has enabled the railroads to purchase
moreefficient and morepowerful locomotives to increase productivity many of
the companys products help to provide this greater productivity in 2001
deliveries of new heavyhaul locomotives were 1085 down from 1397 in 2000
in 2002 the company expects the industry to deliver about 700 new locomotives
as railroads reduce capital spending the company expects new locomotive
purchases to rise slowly above this level during the next several years

currently the active freight car fleet in north america numbers approximately
13 million the average number of new freight cars delivered in each of the
past 10 years was about 50000 annually in 2001 new freight car deliveries
were 34247 compared to 55821 in 2000 the company expects the industry to
deliver about 20000 new freight cars in 2002 well below the average delivery
rate of the past 10 years and below what the company believes is normal
replacement demand of about 40000 units the company believes that the delivery
rate for the next several years will increase as railroads and leasing
companies recognize the benefit of new technology and specialty cars designed to
increase efficiency and productivity

the company believes that its products and services offer railroads the ability
to reduce costs and increase productivity to meet their efficiency goals
however the company operates in a highly competitive environment and there can
be no assurance that increased rail traffic higher fleet utilization or other
economically favorable industry conditions will benefit the company

demand for passenger transit original equipment and aftermarket products is
driven by the replacement building andor expansion programs of transit
authorities these programs are funded in part by federal and state government
programs such as tea21 intermodal surface transportation and efficiency act
which is expected to provide up to 42 billion nationally subject to
appropriations for transitrelated infrastructure through 2003 increased
funding by federal and state governments under tea21 has resulted in strong
demand for new passenger transit vehicles the average delivery rate for new
transit vehicles in the past 10 years was about 500 units annually in 2001 the
industry delivered 1072 new rail transit vehicles compared to 679 in 2000 in
2002 the company expects deliveries to be about 1230 units these high
delivery rates primarily reflect increased orders placed by the metropolitan
transportation authority of new york city the primary new york city contract
will be completed by 2003 but a followon order is expected to be placed in
2002 as such the company expects the transit delivery rate to be in the range
of 600800 units for the next several years

business segments and products

approximately 50 of net sales in 2001 were directly to original equipment
manufacturers oems of locomotives railway freight cars and passenger transit
vehicles we believe that our substantial installed base of oem products is a
significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the
aftermarket because endusers often look to purchase safety and
performancerelated replacement parts from the oem the balance of the sales
were derived from the sale of aftermarket replacement parts repair services and
overhaul work purchased by operators of rail vehicles such as railroads transit
authorities utilities and leasing companies collectively end users or the
aftermarket

we provide products and services through two principal business segments the
freight group and the transit group

freight group  includes components for new and existing freight cars and
locomotives revenues are derived principally from oem and aftermarket sales
including repairs and services revenues from these products as a percentage of
total net sales were 63 66 and 72 in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

all of the assets sold to gets were part of the freight group

specific product lines within the freight group are

 freight car products and services  we manufacture sell and service air
  brake equipment draft gears hand brakes and slack adjusters and composite
  brake shoes blocks and pads for the oem freight car market and for the
  aftermarket in the form of parts and repair services net sales per

                                        3
page

  typical freight car can vary considerably based upon the type and purpose of
  the freight platform with articulated or intermodal cars generally having the
  highest wabtec product content the companys traditional freight products
  include the abdx freight brake valve the mark series draft gears hand brakes
  and slack adjusters and sac1tm articulated coupler

 locomotive products and services  we manufacture sell and service air brake
  equipment cooling equipment gearing compressors air dryers slack
  adjusters brake cylinders and monitoring and control equipment for the
  locomotive oem and aftermarket

we also manufacture switcher and commuter locomotives and provide maintenance
support for these locomotives the locomotive product line also includes
manufacturing and distribution of replacement new and remanufactured components
and parts for regional railroads as a supplier of proprietary oem components
for locomotives manufactured by the electromotive division of general motors
corporation emd and the ge transportation systems unit of general electric
company wabtec also provides these components in the aftermarket directly to
railroad customers

demand for aftermarket components is influenced by rail traffic activity and the
maintenance requirements of the railroads

 electronics  we manufacture sell and service highquality electronics for
  the railroads in the form of onboard systems and braking for locomotives and
  freight cars we are an industry leader in insulating or hardening
  electronic components to protect them from severe conditions including
  extreme temperatures and highshock vibration environments our new product
  development effort has focused on electronic technology for brakes and
  controls and over the past several years we introduced a number of
  significant new products including the epicr electronic brake
  electronically controlled pneumatic ecp freight brake positive train
  control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning
  communication protocols powerlinktm compressor aftercoolers train
  traxtm trainlinktm train sentry iiir fuellinktm and armadillotm

transit group  includes products and services for passenger transit vehicles
typically subway cars and buses revenues are derived primarily from oem and
aftermarket component parts sales revenues from these products as a percentage
of total net sales were 37 34 and 28 in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively

we manufacture sell and service electronic brake equipment pneumatic control
equipment air compressors tread brakes and disc brakes couplers collection
equipment monitoring systems wheels climate control and door equipment and
other components for passenger transit vehicles in 1997 we received contracts
valued at 150 million to provide equipment for 1080 passenger transit cars for
the metropolitan transportation authoritynew york city transit the mta
deliveries of equipment began in late 1999 and are expected to decrease in late
2002

substantially all of our principal passenger transit products are engineered to
customer specifications consequently there is less standardization among these
products than with the freight group products we believe the oem market
presents an opportunity for improved growth during the next several years as
increased federal funding becomes available

consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report

strategy

the company is committed to building shareholder value by executing the
following fourpoint plan

focus on increasing sales to manufacturers of original equipment  the company
currently serves as a tier i supplier to oems in certain markets but it desires
to increase business with these customers to achieve this goal the company
plans to focus on integrating its electrical pneumatic and mechanical
technologies across business units and packaging them as systems in doing so
the company expects to strengthen its position against competitors that do not
have the breadth and depth of wabtecs product line

expand globally  we believe that international markets represent a significant
opportunity for future growth our net sales outside of the united states
comprised approximately 26 24 and 22 of total sales in 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part ii item 8 of this report we intend to increase our existing
international sales through acquisitions direct sales of products through our
subsidiaries and licensees and joint ventures with

                                        4

railway suppliers having a strong presence in their local markets

accelerate new product development  we will continue to emphasize research and
development to create new and improved products to increase our market share and
profitability we are focusing on technological advances especially in the
areas of electronics braking products and other onboard equipment as a means
of new product growth

implement lean principles to improve efficiency and quality  we intend to
build on what we consider to be a leading position as a lowcost producer in the
industry while maintaining worldclass product quality technology and customer
responsiveness through the wabtec quality and performance system qps we
are dedicated to lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement
across all phases of our business our qps includes employeedirected
initiatives through kaizen a japanesedeveloped team concept used to
continuously improve quality lead time and productivity and to reduce costs
these efforts enable us to streamline processes improve product quality and
customer satisfaction reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to
market developments

the companys contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation
provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of
designated stages substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these
and other reasons work in the companys backlog may be delayed or cancelled and
backlog should not be relied upon as an indicator of the companys future
performance the railroad industry in general has historically been subject to
fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of
alternate modes of transportation

engineering and development

consistent with its strategy of using technology to develop new products the
company is actively engaged in a variety of engineering and development
activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2001 2000 and 1999 the
company incurred costs of approximately 332 million 323 million and 344
million respectively on product development and improvement activities
exclusive of manufacturing support such expenditures represented
approximately 42 4 and 41 of net sales for the same periods
respectively from time to time the company conducts specific research projects
in conjunction with universities customers and other railroad product
suppliers

the companys engineering and development program is largely focused upon train
control and new braking technologies with an emphasis on the application of
electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment electronic actuation of braking
has long been a part of the companys transit product line but
interchangeability connectivity and durability have presented problems to the
industry in establishing electronics in freight railway applications efforts
are proceeding in the enhancement of the major components for existing
hardwired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies

intellectual property

the company has numerous us patents patent applications pending and
trademarks as well as foreign patents and trademarks throughout the world the
company also relies on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual
property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to
establish and protect its proprietary rights in its intellectual property

certain trademarks among them the name wabcor were acquired or licensed by
the company from american standard inc in 1990 at the time of the companys
acquisition of the north

american operations of the railway products group of american standard the
1990 acquisition

the company is a party as licensor and licensee to a variety of license
agreements the company does not believe that any single license agreement is of
material importance to its business as a whole

the company and sab wabco holdings bv sab wabco entered into a license
agreement the sab license on december 31 1993 pursuant to which sab wabco
granted the company a license to the intellectual property and knowhow related
to the manufacturing and marketing of certain disc brakes tread brakes and low
noise and resilient wheel products sab wabco is a swedish corporation that was
a former affiliate of the company both having been owned by the same parent in
the early 1990s the sab license expires december 31 2003 but may be renewed
for additional oneyear terms the company believes that the patents which are
covered by this license will expire prior to or concurrently with the license
expiration

the company has issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes
and related products in japan nabco and mitsubishi electric company the
company believes that each of these licensees has a japanese market share of
approximately 50 both licenses were renewed for additional fiveyear terms in
2000 nabco has been a licensee for over 78 years the licensees pay an annual
license fee to the company and also assist the company by acting as liaisons
with key japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in north
america the company believes that its relationships with these licensees have
been beneficial to the companys core transit business and customer
relationships in north america

customers

a few customers within each business segment represent a significant portion of
the companys net sales one customer represented 11 of consolidated sales in
2001 the loss of a few key customers within the companys freight and transit
groups could have an adverse effect on the companys financial condition
results of operations and liquidity

competition

the company operates in a competitive marketplace price competition is strong
and the existence of costconscious purchasers of a limited number has
historically limited wabtecs ability to increase prices in addition to price
competition is based on product performance and technological leadership
quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support the companys
principal competitors vary to some extent across its principal product lines
however within north america new york air brake company a subsidiary of the
german air brake producer knorrbremse ag collectively nyab knorr is the
companys principal overall oem competitor the companys competition for
locomotive freight and passenger transit service and repair business is
primarily from the railroads and passenger transit authorities inhouse
operations the inhouse operations of emd and gets and nyab knorr

employees

at december 31 2001 the company had 4436 full time employees approximately
29 of whom are unionized during 2001 the company reduced employment by 13
excluding asset sales almost all of the employees subject to collective
bargaining agreements are within north america and these agreements are
generally effective through 2002 2003 and 2004

the company considers its relations with its employees and union representation
to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be
favorable to the company

regulation

in the course of its operations the company is subject to various regulations
agencies and entities in the united states these include principally the
federal railroad administration fra and the association of american
railroads aar

the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to
railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for
freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce

the aar promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and
design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in
interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and
component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the
united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval
processes

                                        6

as a result of these regulations and regulations in other countries in which the
company derives its revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a
component manufacturer and for products we sell

effects of seasonality

the companys business is not typically seasonal although the third quarter
results may be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of its major
customers during this period

environmental matters

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

overview

in november 2001 wabtec sold certain assets to ge transportation systems for
240 million in cash the assets sold primarily included locomotive aftermarket
products and services for which wabtec is not the original equipment
manufacturer the results for these businesses along with several other small
noncore businesses that the company has decided to exit are classified as
discontinued operations throughout this report prior period results were
restated for the discontinued operations format

net sales of ongoing operations decreased by 34 from 8112 million in 2000 to
7837 million in 2001 the major causes for the change and their effect on the
companys 2001 results of operations and financial condition include decreases
in component sales due to the continuation of the weak freight market and a
downturn in the locomotive overhaul market offsetting improved sales in the
transit business due to increased governmental spending for transit equipment

net income for 2001 was 618 million or 143 per diluted share as compared
to 254 million or 059 per diluted share in 2000 the results for 2001
include 478 million of income from discontinued operations including a 415
million gain net of tax on the sale and writedown of certain businesses
classified as discontinued operations a 93 million charge for asset
writedowns a 37 million restructuringrelated charge a 685000 gain on the
disposition of excess facilities a 2 million research and development tax
credit and a 17 million charge for severance costs related to a 10 percent
salary workforce reduction the 2000 results include 62 million of income from
discontinued operations a 202 million merger and restructuringrelated
charge a 44 million gain on the disposition of a product line a 51 million
writeoff of a deferred tax asset relating to the termination of the esop and a
2 million legal settlement excluding these nonrecurring and nonoperating
items earnings from continuing operations per diluted share would have been
049 and 082 in 2001 and 2000 respectively

merger and restructuring plan

in 2001 the company completed a merger and restructuring plan with charges
totaling 71 million pretax with approximately 49 million of the charge
expensed in 1999 20 million in 2000 and 2 million in 2001 the plan involved
the elimination of duplicate facilities and excess capacity operational
realignment and related workforce reductions and the evaluation of certain
assets as to their perceived ongoing benefit to the company

as of december 31 2001 32 million of the merger and restructuring charge
still remained as accrued on the balance sheet the accrual on the balance sheet
is discussed in greater detail in note 22 of notes to consolidated financial
statements included in part ii item 8 of this report

the company began and completed a new restructuring plan for the transit rail
business in 2001 the company estimates synergies from the plan will yield
approximately 3 million of pretax cost savings in 2002 and beyond with such
benefits realized through reduced cost of sales and reduced selling general and
administrative expenses the restructuring plan involved operational realignment
and related workforce reductions the charges to complete the restructuring plan
totaled 2 million pretax

the 2 million charge included costs associated with relocating several
production operations from chicago to montreal including severance costs for
approximately 103 employees

net sales decreased 275 million or 34 to 7837 million in 2001 from 8112
million in 2000 this overall decrease was primarily attributable to decreased
north american oem freight car and locomotive component sales volumes and lower
locomotive overhauls all within the freight group sales volumes within the
freight group reflected a softening oem market for freight cars with 34247

in 2002

gross profit decreased to 2099 million in 2001 compared to 2357 million in
the same period of 2000 gross margin as a percentage of sales was 268
compared to 291 in 2000 gross margin is dependent on a number of factors
including pricing sales volume and product mix the decrease in gross profit
and margin is largely attributed to the effect of a decrease in sales volumes
approximately 11 million in gross profit the balance is principally a result
of changes to the sales mix primarily from a drop in the freight group of 8
offset by an increase in the transit group of 5 and overall pricing pressures
in many product lines

total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 199 in 2001 and
195 in the same period a year ago after excluding 93 million for asset
writedowns 37 million for merger and restructuring charges and 17 million
for severance costs in 2001 and 182 million for 2000 merger and restructuring
charges operating expenses would have been 18 and 172 of net sales
respectively without the merger and restructuring charges in both periods and
the asset writedowns and severance costs in 2001 operating expenses would have
increased 15 million in 2001 as compared to 2000

income from operations totaled 541 million in 2001 compared with 778 million
in 2000 with operating margins of 69 and 96 respectively after excluding
the merger and restructuringrelated charges in both periods and the asset
writedowns and severance costs in 2001 and a 2 million legal settlement in
2000 operating income would have been 687 million and 100 million in 2001
and 2000 respectively and 2001 operating margins as a percentage of sales
would have decreased to 88 from 123 in 2000 lower adjusted operating income
resulted from decreased sales volumes in the freight group and changes in
product mix see note 19 of notes to consolidated financial statements

interest expense decreased 232 to 335 million in 2001 from 436 million in
2000 debt net of cash and equivalents was 1879 million at december 31 2001
versus 5341 million at the end of 2000 the decrease in interest expense is
primarily due to the lower debt amount as a result of working capital management
and the sale proceeds from gets received in november 2001 the company expects
interest expense in 2002 to be about 22 million

in 2001 the company recorded foreign exchange losses of 17 million in
february 2000 the company disposed of its transit electrification product line
for 55 million in cash and recognized a gain of 44 million these items were
reported as other income expense net

net sales decreased 329 million or 39 to 8112 million in 2000 from 8441
million in 1999 this overall decrease was primarily attributable to decreased
north american oem freight car and locomotive component sales volumes and lower
locomotive overhauls all within the freight group sales volumes within the
freight group reflected a softening oem market for freight cars with 55821
freight cars delivered in 2000 compared to 74223 in 1999 partially offsetting

result of changes to the sales mix primarily from increased oem component sales
of transit group products at lower margins than the companys overall historical
results pricing pressures and manufacturing inefficiencies primarily related
to merger integration efforts

222 in the same period a year ago after excluding the merger and
restructuring charges of 182 million in 2000 and 429 million in 1999
operating expenses would have been 172 and 171 of net sales respectively
without the merger and restructuring charges in both periods operating expenses
would have decreased 46 million in 2000 as compared to 1999 this reduction
was primarily the result of continuing cost reduction programs

income from operations totaled 778 million in 2000 compared with 878 million
in 1999 with operating margins of 96 and 104 respectively after excluding
the merger and restructuring related charges in both periods and a 2 million
legal settlement in 2000 operating income would have been 100 million and

versus 5615 million at the end of 1999 the increase in interest expense even
though the net debt balance decreased in the fourth quarter of 2000 is
primarily due to higher interest rates

in february 2000 the company disposed its transit electrification product line
for 55 million in cash and recognized a gain of 44 million which is
reported as other income

operating cash flow in 2001 was 1191 million as compared to 602 million in
the same period a year ago working capital decreased significantly during 2001
primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and inventory during 2001
and 2000 cash outlays for merger and restructuring activities were
approximately 68 million and 29 million respectively and are reported as a
reduction to cash provided by operating activities excluding these cash
outlays cash provided by operating activities would have been approximately
1259 and 892 million respectively this increase in operating cash flow in
2001 was primarily the result of improved working capital management

cash provided by investing activities increased in 2001 to 2274 million versus
cash used by investing activities of 215 million a year ago the 2001 amount
is primarily from the sale of businesses to ge for 240 million in 2001 2000

business acquisitions capital expenditures for continuing operations were 207
million 232 million and 241 million in 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively
the majority of capital expenditures for these periods relates to upgrades to
existing equipment replacement of existing equipment and purchases of new
equipment due to expansion of wabtecs operations where the company believes
overall cost savings can be achieved through increasing efficiencies the
company expects 2002 capital expenditures for equipment purchased for similar
purposes to approximate 215 million

cash used for financing activities was 2972 million in 2001 versus 38 million
in 2000 during 2001 the company reduced longterm debt by 2983 million
during 2000 the company reduced longterm debt by 284 million the company
issued 75 million of senior notes in the first quarter of 1999 to repay amounts
outstanding on certain unsecured bank term debt and repaid a portion of the
companys previous revolving credit facility historically the company has
financed the purchase of significant businesses utilizing cash flow generated
from operations and amounts available under its credit facilities in addition
the issuance of the 1999 notes increased the companys liquidity by reducing its
outstanding revolving credit borrowings and thereby increasing its available
borrowing capacity

credit agreement

in november 1999 in connection with the merger wabco terminated its then
existing secured credit agreement and refinanced the then existing unsecured
motivepower credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this
unsecured credit agreement currently provides a 275 million fiveyear revolving
credit facility expiring in 2004 and a 364day 100 million convertible
revolving credit facility maturing in november 2004 with annual renewals each
november in november 2000 the company and the banks negotiated a reduction in
the 364day facility from 275 million to 213 million primarily due to having
credit availability in excess of current and forecasted needs in an effort to
reduce commitment costs and other related fees in november 2001 the company
negotiated a further reduction in the 364day facility from 213 million to 100
million as a result of the 200 million net of tax cash proceeds from the sale
of locomotive businesses to ge at december 31 2001 the company had available
bank borrowing capacity net of letters of credit of approximately 288
million

under the credit agreement the company may elect a base rate an interest rate
based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor a cost of
funds rate and a bid rate the base rate is the greater of abn amro bank nvs
prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor
rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 875 to 200 basis points
depending on the companys consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios
the cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on abn amro bank
nvs then cost of funds under the bid rate option any participating bank may
propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds which rate may either be
a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor

the credit agreement limits the companys ability to declare or pay cash
dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other
distributions subject to certain exceptions the credit agreement contains
various other covenants and restrictions including without limitation the
following a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness a
limitation on mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions a
limitation on liens a limitation on sale and leasebacks a limitation on
investments loans and advances a limitation on certain debt payments a
limitation on capital expenditures a minimum interest expense coverage ratio
and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio

the credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment
defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material

respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the
company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and
change of control of the company

credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to common
indexes such as libor the maximum credit agreement borrowings average credit
agreement borrowings and weightedaverage contractual interest rate on credit
agreement borrowings was 358 million 2727 million and 638 respectively
for 2001 to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this
variablerate debt the company entered into interest rate swaps which
effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowings
during the term of the swap contracts on december 31 2001 the notional value
of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled 60 million and effectively changed
the companys interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 870 the
interest rate swap agreements mature in 2003 the company is exposed to credit
risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties however since only
the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than
the notional amount the counterparties are large financial institutions and the
company does not anticipate nonperformance

9 38 senior notes due june 2005

in june 1995 the company issued 100 million of 9375 senior notes due in 2005
the 1995 notes in january 1999 the company issued an additional 75
million of 9375 senior notes which are due in 2005 the 1999 notes the 1995
notes and the 1999 notes are collectively the notes the 1999 notes were
issued at a premium resulting in an effective rate of 85 the terms of the
1995 notes and the 1999 notes are substantially the same and the 1995 notes and
the 1999 notes were issued pursuant to indentures that are substantially the
same the issuance of the 1999 notes improved the companys financial liquidity
by i using a portion of the proceeds to repay a shortterm 30 million loan
associated with the rockwell acquisition that bore interest at 956 ii using
a portion of the proceeds to repay variablerate revolving credit borrowings
thereby increasing amounts available under the revolving credit facility and
iii repaying the remaining unpaid principal of a 102 million loan from a
prior acquisition

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu in
right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness under i capitalized
lease obligations ii the credit agreement iii indebtedness of the company
for money borrowed and iv indebtedness evidenced by notes debentures bonds
or other similar instruments for the payment of which the company is responsible
or liable unless in the case of clause iii or iv in the instrument
creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the same is outstanding it
is provided that such obligations are subordinate in right of payment to the
notes

the notes are callable at par in june 2002 the company will evaluate whether
the notes or portions thereof should be called at that time and replaced with
borrowings under the credit agreement

industrial revenue bond

in july 1998 a subsidiary of the company entered into a 10 year 75 million
debt obligation that bears an interest rate of 55 and is payable in monthly
principal and interest installments the proceeds of the bond provided financing
for the purchase of a building used in the companys operations

principal repayments of outstanding loan balances are due at various intervals
until maturity see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part ii item 8 of this report

the company believes based on current levels of operations and forecasted
earnings cash flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund its working capital
and capital equipment needs as well as meeting the debt service requirements if
the companys sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the companys cash
requirements the company may need to refinance its existing debt or obtain
additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives
would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be
expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in
place

effects of inflation

general price inflation has not had a material impact on the companys results
of operations some of the companys labor contracts contain negotiated salary
and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses
which would cause the companys cost to automatically increase if inflation were
to become significant

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in
interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with its
variablerate debt after considering the effects of interest rate swaps
further described below the companys variable rate debt represents 1 of total
longterm debt at december 31 2001 and 51 in 2000 the variable portion is so
low because management has entered into payfixed receivevariable interest
rate swap contracts that partially mitigate the impact of variablerate debt
interest rate increases see note 9 of notes to consolidated financial
statements included in part ii item 8 of this report at december 31 2001
an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have minimal
impact on the companys annual earnings assuming no additional intervention
strategies by management

the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
133 and as amended by sfas 138 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities effective january 1 2001 in the application the company
has concluded that its swap contracts qualify for special cash flow hedge
accounting which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding
adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet while creating
some volatility in future earnings due to market sensitivity and
ineffectiveness in offsetting changes in interest rates of wabtecs variable
rate borrowings see note 20 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part ii item 8 of this report this fluctuation is not expected to
have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of
operations and liquidity

foreign currency exchange risk

the company occasionally enters into several types of financial instruments for
the purpose of managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations in countries in which the company has significant operations as of
december 31 2001 the company had no such instruments outstanding

wabtec is also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign
currency exchange rates to the extent its operations are conducted in currencies
other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2001 approximately
74 of wabtecs net sales are in the united states 9 in canada 1 in mexico
and 16 in other international locations primarily europe see note 19 of
notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this
report at december 31 2001 the company does not believe changes in foreign
currency exchange rates represent a material risk to results of operations
financial position or liquidity

wabtecs market risk exposure is not substantially different from its exposure
at december 31 2000

recent accounting pronouncements

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 142
goodwill and other intangible assets under its provisions all goodwill and
other intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be routinely
amortized under a straightline basis of estimated useful life instead they
will be subject to assessments for impairment by applying a fairvaluebased
test sfas no 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15
2001 and upon adoption the company will cease to record approximately 8
million of goodwill amortization the company has not completed the process of
evaluating whether any impairment will result from adopting it

in august 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 144
accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets under its
provisions all tangible longlived assets whether to be held and used or to be
disposed of by sale or other means will be tested for recoverability whenever
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
recoverable sfas no 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december
15 2001 the company early adopted sfas 144 in the third quarter of 2001 see

repair or upgrade costs per unit and historical experience in recent years the
company has introduced several new products the company does not have the same
level of historical warranty experience for these new products as it does for
its continuing products therefore warranty reserves have been established for
these new products based upon managements estimates actual future results may
vary from such estimates warranty expense was 141 million 112 million and
73 million for 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively warranty reserves were 154

financial derivatives and hedging activities the company periodically enters
into interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of interest rate changes

variable calculated on a notional principal amount the interest rate
differential to be paid or received is accrued to interest expense see note 9

the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
133 and as amended by sfas 138 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities effective january 1 2001 resulting in the recording of
current assets of 266000 long term assets of 399000 current liabilities of
760000 long term liabilities of 11 million and a decrease in other
comprehensive loss of 12 million in the application the company has
concluded its interest rate swap contracts qualify for special cash flow hedge
accounting which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding
adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet while creating
some volatility in future earnings due to market sensitivity and
ineffectiveness in offsetting changes in interest rates of the companys
variable rate borrowings

credit agreement

in november 1999 in connection with the merger wabco terminated its then
existing secured credit agreement and refinanced the then existing unsecured
motivepower credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this
resulted in an unsecured credit agreement which provided a 275 million five
year revolving credit facility expiring in 2004 and a 364day 275 million
convertible revolving credit facility in november 2000 the company and the
banks negotiated a reduction in the 364day facility from 275 million to 213
million primarily due to having credit availability in excess of current and
forecasted needs in an effort to reduce commitment costs and other related fees
in november 2001 the company and the banks negotiated a further reduction in
the 364day facility from 213 million to 100 million at december 31 2001
the company had available bank borrowing capacity net of letters of credit of
approximately 288 million

in connection with the establishment of its new revolving credit facilities in
1999 the company wrote off previously deferred financing costs of approximately
850000 net of tax 02 per diluted share which has been reported as an
extraordinary item in the accompanying financial statements

under the credit agreement the company may elect a base rate an interest rate
based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor a cost of
funds rate and a bid rate the base rate is the greater of abn amro bank nvs
prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor
rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 875 to 200 basis points
depending on the companys consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios
the cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on abn amro bank
nvs then cost of funds under the bid rate option any participating bank may
propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds which rate may either be
a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor

the credit agreement limits the companys ability to declare or pay cash
dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other
distributions subject to certain exceptions the credit agreement contains
various other covenants and restrictions including without limitation the
following a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness a
limitation on mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions a
limitation on liens a limitation on sale and leasebacks a limitation on
investments loans and advances a limitation on certain debt payments a
limitation on capital expenditures a minimum interest expense coverage ratio
and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio

the credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment
defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material
respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the
company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and
change of control of the company

credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to common
indexes such as libor the maximum credit agreement borrowings average credit
agreement borrowings and weightedaverage contractual interest rate on credit
agreement borrowings was 358 million 2727 million and 638 respectively
for 2001 to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on a portion of this
variablerate debt the company entered into interest rate swaps which
effectively convert a portion of the debt from variable to fixedrate borrowings
during the term of the swap contracts on december 31 2001 the notional value
of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled 60 million and effectively changed
the companys interest rate from a variable rate to a fixed rate of 870 the
interest rate swap agreements mature in 2003 the company is exposed to credit
risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties however since only
the cash interest payments are exchanged exposure is significantly less than
the notional amount the counterparties are large financial institutions and the
company does not anticipate nonperformance

since compensation expense associated with option grants would be recognized
over the vesting period the initial impact of applying sfas no 123 on pro
forma net income is not representative of the potential impact on pro forma net
income in future years in each subsequent year pro forma compensation expense
would include the effect of recognizing a portion of compensation expense from
multiple awards

for purposes of presenting pro forma results the fair value of each option
grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing
model with the following weightedaverage assumptions

the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
fair value of traded options which are significantly different than employee
stock options although this valuation model is an acceptable method for use in
presenting pro forma information because of the differences in traded options
and employee stock options the blackscholes model does not necessarily provide
a single measure of the fair value of employee stock options

item 1 business

general

westinghouse air brake technologies corporation does business as wabtec
corporation all references to we our us the company and wabtec
refer to westinghouse air brake technologies corporation a delaware
corporation and its subsidiaries the company was formed from the november 1999
merger of westinghouse air brake company wabco and motivepower industries
inc motivepower wabco has its origin in a business founded by george
westinghouse in 1869 the 1999 merger was accounted for as a poolingof
interests accordingly prior period consolidated financial statements have
been restated giving effect to this transaction as if it had occurred as of the
beginning of the earliest period presented the discussions that follow are
based on the combined companies for each year

wabtec is one of north americas largest providers of valueadded
technologybased equipment and services for the rail industry the companys
products can be found on virtually all us locomotives freight cars and
passenger transit vehicles the company is based in wilmerding pa and has
6244 employees at facilities throughout north america and around the world

the company believes that it maintains a market share in excess of 50 in north
america for its primary brakingrelated equipment and significant market shares
in north america for its other principal products wabtec also sells products in
europe africa australia south america and asia the companys products which
are intended to enhance safety improve productivity and reduce maintenance
costs for customers include the following air brakes electronic controls and
monitors traction motors cooling equipment turbochargers lowhorsepower
locomotives couplers door controls draft gears and brake shoes the company
aggressively pursues technological advances for both new product development and
product enhancements

management and insiders of the company own approximately 25 of wabtecs
outstanding shares with the remaining shares held by investment companies and
individuals the company encourages its employees to own wabtec stock so that
they have a significant stake in the success of the company in addition
executive management incentives are designed to align management interests with
those of outside shareholders by focusing on cash flow generation and working
capital reduction

industry overview

the companys operating results are strongly influenced by general economic
conditions and the financial conditions and level of activity of the global
railroad industry rail traffic in terms of both freight and passengers is a
key factor underlying the demand for the companys products government
investment in public rail transportation also plays a significant role

in 2000 us freight railroads carried a record 146 trillion revenue tonmiles
a main indicator of rail activity defined as weight times distance traveled by
class i railroads up 17 from the prior year although tonmiles increased
however railroads began to defer maintenance of existing locomotives and
freight cars to offset significantly higher fuel costs in addition railroads
had excess capacity of locomotives and freight cars after the high rate of new
equipment deliveries in recent years as a result railroads were able to park
existing equipment and reduce purchases of aftermarket components for repair and
maintenance of their equipment fleets

demand for components for new locomotives and freight cars has been strong in
recent years due to historically high deliveries of new equipment in 2000
however deliveries of new equipment were lower than the previous year for both
locomotives and freight cars

currently the active locomotive fleet in the north american market numbers
approximately 33000 units which include heavyhaul freight locomotives
commuter locomotives and lowerhorsepower shorthaul and terminal locomotives
deliveries of new heavyhaul locomotives reached approximately 1400 in 2000 as
railroads invested in modernizing a portion of their fleets this compares to
approximately 1500 in 1999 in 2001 the company expects the industry to
deliver approximately 1200 new locomotives

currently the active freight car fleet in north america numbers approximately
13 million deliveries of new freight cars reached a 20year high of
approximately 76000 in 1998 as railroads and shippers invested in modernizing
their fleets in 2000 new freight car deliveries dropped to approximately
56000 in 2001 the company expects the industry to
                                        2
page   4

deliver about 45000 new freight cars which would be slightly below the average
delivery rate of the past 10 years

demand for fleet maintenance services is driven by the railroads focus on cost
reduction and productivity improvements as the industry has consolidated over
recent decades and as railroads consider outsourcing nontransportation
functions when possible the company supplies its own component parts for use
in overhaul and maintenance under these contracts in this manner the
locomotive fleet maintenance contracts provide additional opportunities for
sales of component parts

since the deregulation of the us railroad industry in 1980 freight railroads
have reduced their equipment base consolidated operations and reduced
suppliers in order to lower operating costs and improve their competitive
position compared to trucking companies which compete with the railroad
industry in addition they have been consolidating and merging hoping to
achieve additional operating and financial efficiencies that will allow them to
compete more effectively

the company believes these consolidations offer opportunities to increase
business with the surviving railroads as these railroads seek operating
efficiencies through such means as outsourcing locomotive fleet maintenance and
components repair in addition the supplier base has been consolidating and
the company is a primary consolidator the company operates in a highly
competitive environment and there can be no assurance that increased rail
traffic higher fleet utilization or other economically favorable industry
conditions will benefit the company

demand for passenger transit original equipment and aftermarket products is
driven by the replacement building andor expansion programs of transit
authorities these programs are funded in part by federal and state government
programs such as tea21 intermodal surface transportation and efficiency act
which is expected to provide up to 42 billion nationally subject to
appropriations for transitrelated infrastructure through 2003 increased
funding by federal and state governments under tea21 has resulted in strong
demand for new passenger transit vehicles

business segments and products

approximately 58 of net sales in 2000 were derived from the sale of aftermarket
replacement parts repair services and overhaul work purchased by operators of
rail vehicles such as railroads transit authorities utilities and leasing
companies collectively end users or the aftermarket the balance of sales
was directly to north american original equipment manufacturers oems of
locomotives railway freight cars and passenger transit vehicles we believe
that our substantial installed base of oem products is a significant competitive
advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because end
users often look to purchase safety and performancerelated replacement parts
from the oem

we provide products and services through two principal business segments the
freight group and the transit group

freight group  includes products geared to the production of components for
and the repair and servicing of freight cars and locomotives revenues are
derived principally from oem and aftermarket sales including repairs and
services revenues from these products as a percentage of total net sales were
73 79 and 80 in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

specific product lines within the freight group are

   freight car products and services  we manufacture sell and service air
     brake equipment draft gears hand brakes and slack adjusters and
     composite brake shoes blocks and pads for the oem freight car market and
     for the aftermarket in the form of parts and repair services net sales per
     typical freight car can vary considerably based upon the type and purpose
     of the freight platform with articulated or intermodal cars generally
     having the highest wabtec product content the companys traditional
     freight products include the abdx freight brake valve the mark series
     draft gears hand brakes and slack adjusters and sac1tm articulated
     coupler

   locomotive products and services  we manufacture sell and service air
     brake equipment traction motors generators alternators turbochargers
     cooling equipment gearing diesel engines compressors air dryers slack
     adjusters brake cylinders and monitoring and control equipment for the
     locomotive oem and aftermarket

we also provide fleet maintenance overhauling and remanufacturing of
locomotives and diesel engines and manufacturing of switcher commuter and mid
range locomotives up to 4000 horsepower the locomotive product line also
includes manufacturing

                                        3
page   5

and distribution of replacement new and remanufactured components and parts for
freight and passenger railroads including every class i railroad in north
america industrial powerrelated markets and to a lesser extent oems wabtec
provides aftermarket components for locomotives manufactured by the
electromotive division of general motors corporation emd certain
components for locomotives made by the ge transportation systems unit of general
electric company ge and certain components for alco locomotives wabtec
believes it is the leading independent supplier in north america of many
aftermarket locomotive components

demand for components is influenced by rail traffic activity and the maintenance
requirements of the railroads currently railroads have deferred maintenance to
offset higher fuel costs this business is highly competitive as the company
faces competition from emd ge and numerous smaller independent manufacturers
and distributors emd and ge accounted for virtually 100 of the new
highhorsepower locomotives delivered in the united states in the past five
years and as oems are the principal suppliers of original parts for their
locomotives

   electronics  we manufacture sell and service highquality electronics
     for the railroads in the form of onboard systems and braking for
     locomotives and freight cars we are an industry leader in insulating or
     hardening electronic components to protect them from severe conditions
     including extreme temperatures and highshock vibration environments our
     new product development effort has focused on electronic technology for
     brakes and controls and over the past several years we introduced a
     number of significant new products including the epicr electronic brake
     electronically controlled pneumatic ecp freight brake positive train
     control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global
     positioning communication protocols powerlinktm compressor
     aftercoolers train traxtm trainlinktm train sentry iiir
     fuellinktm and armadillotm

transit group  includes products for passenger transit vehicles typically
subways and buses revenues are derived primarily from oem and aftermarket
component parts sales revenues from these products as a percentage of total
net sales were 27 21 and 20 in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively

we manufacture sell and service electronic brake equipment pneumatic control
equipment air compressors tread brakes and disc brakes couplers collection
equipment monitoring systems wheels climate control and door equipment and
other components for passenger transit vehicles in 1997 we received contracts
valued at 150 million to provide equipment for 1080 passenger transit cars for
the metropolitan transportation authoritynew york city transit the mta
deliveries of equipment began in late 1999 and are expected to increase
significantly during 2001

substantially all of our principal passenger transit products are engineered to
customer specifications consequently there is less standardization among these
products than with the freight group products we believe the oem market
presents an opportunity for improved growth during the next several years as
funding from tea21 becomes available

consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report

strategy

we are committed to building shareholder value by reducing debt and debt service
costs capitalizing on the synergies of our merger with motivepower industries
and enhancing our leading position as a producer of valueadded equipment for
the rail industry building on our leading market position strong aftermarket

a platform for offering additional installation replacement parts and repair
services to customers

grow international presence  we believe that international markets represent a
significant opportunity for future growth our net sales outside of the united
states comprised approximately 27 26 and 27 in 2000 1999 and 1998
respectively see note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part ii item 8 of this report we intend to increase our existing
international sales through acquisitions direct sales of products through our
subsidiaries and licensees and joint ventures with railway suppliers having a
strong presence in their local markets

pursue strategic alliances and acquisitions  we intend to pursue strategic
alliances and possibly acquisitions that expand our product lines increase

the companys contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation
provisions including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of
designated stages including without limitation contracts relating to the mta
substantial scopeofwork adjustments are common for these and other reasons
work in the companys backlog may be delayed or cancelled and backlog should not
be relied upon as an indicator of the companys future performance the railroad
industry in general has historically been subject to fluctuations due to
overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternate modes of
transportation the freight group has significant multiple year locomotive
overhaul and fleet contracts that may provide some level of assurance that
additional component parts sales in support of overhauling services will occur
in the future

for oem passenger transit products there is a longer leadtime for car
deliveries and accordingly the company carries a large backlog of orders

based upon widely available industry data concerning freight and locomotive oem
backlog and projected 2001 deliveries that indicate a decline from 2000
deliveries the company believes demand for its products will remain reasonably
strong for the foreseeable future

engineering and development

consistent with its strategy of using technology to develop new products the
company is actively engaged in a variety of engineering and development
activities for the fiscal years ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 the
company incurred costs of approximately 325 million 357 million and 316
million respectively on product development and improvement activities
exclusive of manufacturing support such expenditures represented
approximately 32 32 and 3 of net sales for the same periods
respectively from time to time the company conducts specific research projects
in conjunc

                                        5

tion with universities customers and other railroad product suppliers

the companys engineering and development program is largely focused upon new
braking technologies with an emphasis on the application of electronics to
traditional pneumatic equipment electronic actuation of braking has long been a
part of the companys transit product line but interchangeability connectivity
and durability have presented problems to the industry in establishing
electronics in freight railway applications efforts are proceeding in the
enhancement of the major components for existing hardwired braking equipment
and development of new electronic technologies

intellectual property

the company has numerous us patents patent applications pending and
trademarks as well as foreign patents and trademarks throughout the world the
company also relies on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual
property laws nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to
establish and protect its proprietary rights in its intellectual property

certain trademarks among them the name wabcor were acquired or licensed by
the company from american standard inc in 1990 at the time of the companys
acquisition of the north american operations of the railway products group of
american standard the 1990 acquisition

the company is a party as licensor and licensee to a variety of license
agreements the company does not believe that any single license agreement
other than the sab license discussed in the following paragraph is of material
importance to its business as a whole

the company and sab wabco holdings bv sab wabco entered into a license
agreement the sab license on december 31 1993 pursuant to which sab wabco
granted the company a license to the intellectual property and knowhow related
to the manufacturing and marketing of certain disc brakes tread brakes and low
noise and resilient wheel products sab wabco is a swedish corporation that was
a former affiliate of the company both having been owned by the same parent in
the early 1990s

the company is authorized to manufacture and sell the licensed products
described above in north america including to oem manufacturers located
outside north america if such licensed products are incorporated into a final
product to be sold in north america sab wabco has a right of first refusal to
supply the company with boughtin components of the licensed products on
commercially competitive terms to the extent sab wabco files additional patent
or trademark applications or develops additional knowhow in connection with
the licensed products such additional intellectual property and knowhow are
also subject to the sab license the company may at its expense request the
service of sab wabco in manufacturing installing testing and maintaining the
licensed products and providing customer support sab wabco is entitled to a
free nonexclusive license of the use of any improvements to the licensed
products developed by the company if any such improvements are patented by the
company sab wabco has the right to request the transfer of such patents upon
payment of reasonable compensation therefore in such cases the company is
entitled to a free nonexclusive license to use the patented product under the
sab license the company is required to pay a lump sum fee for certain licensed
products as well as royalties based on specified percentages of sales the sab
license expires december 31 2003 but may be renewed for additional oneyear
terms

customers

a few customers within each business segment represent a significant portion of
the companys net sales however no one customer represented more than 10 of
consolidated sales in 2000 one customer represented 12 of freight group sales
and three customers represented 15 13 and 10 of transit group sales
respectively nevertheless the loss of a few key customers within the companys
freight and transit groups could have an adverse effect on the companys
financial condition results of operations and liquidity

competition

the company operates in a competitive marketplace price competition is strong
and the existence of costconscious purchasers of a limited number has
historically limited wabtecs ability to increase prices in addition to price
competition is based on product performance and technological leadership
quality reliability of delivery and customer service and support the companys
principal competitors vary to some extent across its principal product lines
however within north america new york air brake

company a subsidiary of the german air brake producer knorrbremse ag
collectively nyab knorr is the companys principal overall oem competitor
along with the oems themselves the companys competition for locomotive
freight and passenger transit service and repair business is primarily from the
railroads and passenger transit authorities inhouse operations the inhouse
operations of emd and ge and nyabknorr

employees

at december 31 2000 the company had 6244 employees approximately 42 of whom
are unionized almost all of the employees subject to collective bargaining
agreements are within north america and these agreements are generally effective
through 2001 2002 and 2003

the company considers its relations with its employees and union representation
to be good but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be
favorable to the company

regulation

in the course of its operations the company is subject to various regulations
agencies and entities in the united states these include principally the
federal railroad administration fra and the association of american
railroads aar

the fra administers and enforces federal laws and regulations relating to
railroad safety these regulations govern equipment and safety standards for
freight cars and other rail equipment used in interstate commerce

the aar promulgates a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and
design of equipment relationships among railroads with respect to railcars in
interchange and other matters the aar also certifies railcar builders and
component manufacturers that provide equipment for use on railroads in the
united states new products generally must undergo aar testing and approval
processes

as a result of these regulations and regulations in other countries in which the
company derives its revenues we must maintain certain certifications as a
component manufacturer and for products we sell

effects of seasonality

the companys business is not seasonal although the third quarter results may
be impacted by vacation and plant shutdowns at several of its major customers
during this period

        of operations

overview

net sales decreased by 83 from 11 billion in 1999 to 10 billion in 2000
the major causes for the change and their effect on the companys 2000 results
of operations and financial condition include decreases in component sales due
to a slowdown in north american freight car and locomotive deliveries and a
severe downturn in the locomotive overhaul market offsetting improved sales and
backlog in the transit business due to increased governmental spending for
transit equipment

net income for 2000 was 254 million or 059 per diluted share as compared
to 366 million or 083 per diluted share in 1999 the results for 2000

relating to the termination of the esop and a 2 million legal settlement the

merger of the company and motivepower industries inc the merger the
company estimates synergies from the plan yielded approximately 20 million of
pretax cost savings in 2000 and reached an ongoing annualized savings of 25
million pretax with such benefits realized through reduced cost of sales and
reduced selling general and administrative expenses the merger and
restructuring plan involves the elimination of duplicate facilities and excess
capacity operational realignment and related workforce reductions and the
evaluation of certain assets as to their perceived ongoing benefit to the
company the company estimates the charges to complete the merger and
restructuring plan will now total 84 million pretax due to an acceleration
and refinement of the plan with approximately 50 million of the charge
previously expensed in 1999 and 29 million in 2000 the company expects the
remaining charge of 5 million to be incurred in 2001

the 79 million charge to date included the following announced actions

   costs associated with the transaction for items such as investment bankers
     legal fees accountant fees sec fees etc

billion in 1999 this overall decrease was primarily attributable to decreased
north american oem freight car and locomotive component sales volumes and lower
locomotive overhauls all within the freight group sales volumes within the
freight group reflect a softening oem market for freight cars with 55821
freight cars delivered in 2000 compared to 74223 in 1999 partially offsetting
these decreases were increases in transit group sales due to increased
shipments under the mta contract the company estimates the oem freight car and
locomotive industries will deliver 45000 freight cars and 1200 locomotives
respectively in 2001

gross profit decreased to 2778 million in 2000 compared to 3332 million in
the same period of 1999 gross margin as a percentage of sales was 27
compared to 297 in 1999 gross margin is dependent on a number of factors
including pricing sales volume and product mix the decrease in gross profit
and margins is largely attributed to the effect of a decrease in sales volumes
approximately 40 million offsetting approximately 10 million of synergies
realized as a result of recent restructuring and integration efforts the
balance is principally a result of changes to sales mix primarily from increased
oem component sales of transit group products at lower margins as compared to
the companys overall historical results pricing pressures and manufacturing
inefficiencies primarily related to merger integration efforts

total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were 183 in 2000 and
194 in the same period a year ago after excluding the 2000 271 million and
the 1999 436 million merger and restructuring charges operating expenses
would have been 157 and 155 of net sales respectively without the merger
and restructuring charges in both periods operating expenses would have
decreased 111 million in 2000 as compared to 1999 this reduction was
primarily the result of continuing cost reduction programs and the realization
of approximately 10 million of synergies from the 1999 merger

income from operations totaled 895 million in 2000 compared with 116 million
in 1999 with operating margins of 87 and 103 respectively after excluding
the merger and restructuring related charges in both periods operating income
would have been 1206 million and 1649 million in 2000 and 1999
respectively and 2000 operating margins as a percentage of sales decreased to
117 from 147 in 1999 lower adjusted operating income resulted from
decreased sales volumes in the freight group and changes in product mix see

interest expense increased 25 to 455 million in 2000 from 444 million in
1999 debt net of cash and equivalents was 5341 million at december 31 2000
versus 5615 million at the end of 1999 the increase in interest expense even
though the net debt balance decreased in the fourth quarter of 2000 is
primarily due to higher interest rates

in february 2000 the company disposed its transit electrification product line
for 55 million in cash and recognized a gain of 44 million which is
reported as other income

the effective income tax rate for 2000 was 467 as compared to 469 in 1999
wabtec expects the ongoing rate to be approximately 36 the 2000 rate includes
the effect of the one time noncash writeoff of the deferred tax asset 51
million relating to the termination of the esop and after excluding this
effect the rate would be 36 in 1999 after excluding the assumed tax benefit
component of the merger and restructuring charge the effective tax rate would
be 356 the company has consolidated united states federal net operating loss

in 1999 a 469000 extraordinary loss net of tax was incurred on the
extinguishment of certain term debt as well as an 850000 extraordinary loss
net of tax for the writeoff of deferred financing fees on the refinancing of
the companys principal credit facility in november 1999 in connection with the

net sales increased 82 to 11 billion in 1999 from 1 billion in 1998 the
increase was driven by acquisitions primarily within the freight group which
contributed 113 million of sales in 1999 incremental revenue from the
acquisitions along with an increase in transit group sales were partially
offset by a slowdown in the locomotive overhaul market and in us freight car
deliveries which decreased slightly in 1999 to 74223 from 75685 in 1998

cost of sales increased 73 to 7879 million in 1999 from 7344 million in
1998 gross margin increased to 297 as compared to 291 in 1998 after
excluding the cost of sales component of the merger and restructuring charge
gross margin would have increased to 302 compared to 291 in 1998 the
increase is attributed to volume and a favorable product mix in the freight
group component companies and from the increased volume of the transit group

selling general and administrative expenses increased 74 to 122 million from
1136 million in 1998 cost reductions and lower incentiverelated expenses
were offset by the operating expenses of acquired companies 18 million

engineering expenses increased 13 to 357 million from 316 million primarily
as a result of the rockwell acquisition in october 1998 and new product
development efforts

amortization expense increased 38 to 158 million in 1999 from 115 million
in 1998 the increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions made late in
1998 rockwell railroad electronics division

income from operations totaled 116 million in 1999 compared with 145 million
in 1998 with operating margins of 103 and 14 respectively after excluding
the operating expense component of the merger and restructuring charge
operating income for 1999 would have been 1649 million and operating margins
as a percentage of sales for 1999 increased to 147 slightly higher than 14
in the prior year higher adjusted operating income resulted from higher sales
volume and related gross profit favorable aftermarket sales volume at
relatively strong operating margins in the transit group and the component
companies in the freight group were the primary reasons for the increase in
operating income see note 16 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part ii item 8 of this report

interest expense increased 197 to 444 million in 1999 from 371 million in
1998 debt net of cash and equivalents was 562 million as of december 31
1999 versus 565 million as of december 31 1998 the increase in interest
expense even though the net debt balance decreased is due to wabtec carrying a
higher average debt balance in 1999 as a result of the late 1998 acquisitions
rockwell  80 million and young  68 million and the 1999 acquisitions of
gg locotronics qtron and agc technologies 32 million wabtec also funded
cash transaction costs associated with the merger which totaled approximately
29 million

investment income  argentina represents income recognized related to an
investment in argentina which was sold in 1998 for cash and a secured note
receivable

other expense of 90000 was recorded in 1999 versus other income of 3 million
in 1998 the fluctuation is due to foreign exchange gainslosses as a foreign
exchange loss virtually offsetting in 1999 compared to a foreign exchange gain
of 2 million in 1998

the company recorded income tax expense of 336 million as compared to 421
million in 1998 the effective tax rate for 1999 was 469 as compared to 347
in 1998 after excluding the assumed tax benefit component of the merger and
restructuring charge wabtec incurred income tax expense of 43 million in 1999
or an effective tax rate of 356 as compared to 347 in 1998 the 1998 rate
was lower due to a nonrecurring deferred tax liability reversal wabtec expects
the ongoing rate to be approximately 36 the company has consolidated mexican

liquidity and capital resources

liquidity is provided primarily by operating cash flow and borrowings under the
companys credit facilities with a consortium of commercial banks credit
agreement the following is a summary of selected cash flow information and

operating cash flow in 2000 was 602 million as compared to 774 million in
the same period a year ago working capital increased 57 since 1999 primarily
due to an increase to accounts receivable during 2000 and 1999 cash outlays
for merger and restructuring activities were approximately 28 million and 29
million respectively and are reported as a reduction to cash provided by
operating activities excluding these cash outlays cash provided by operating
activities would have been approximately 887

                                        16
page   18

and 1067 million respectively this decrease in operating cash flow in 2000
was primarily the result of lower operating income

cash used for investing activities declined in 2000 to 215 million from 664
million a year ago in 2000 1999 and 1998 the company used 7 million 322
million and 1802 million respectively for certain business acquisitions
capital expenditures were 263 million 308 million and 578 million in
2000 1999 and 1998 respectively the majority of capital expenditures for
these periods relates to upgrades to existing equipment replacement of existing
equipment and purchases of new equipment due to expansion of wabtecs
operations where the company believes overall cost savings can be achieved
through increasing efficiencies the company expects 2001 capital expenditures
for equipment purchased for similar purposes to approximate 35 million

cash used for financing activities was 38 million in 2000 versus 117 million
in 1999 during 2000 the company reduced longterm debt by 284 million the
company issued 75 million of senior notes in the first quarter of 1999 to repay
amounts outstanding on certain unsecured bank term debt and repaid a portion of
the companys previous revolving credit facility historically the company has
financed the purchase of significant businesses utilizing cash flow generated
from operations and amounts available under its credit facilities in addition
the issuance of the 1999 notes increased the companys liquidity by reducing its
outstanding revolving credit borrowings and thereby increasing its available
borrowing capacity

the company estimates the charges at completion of the merger and restructuring
plan will total approximately 84 million pretax with approximately 79 million
incurred to date

the company has adopted a plan by which it may repurchase up to 75 million of
company common stock through open market purchases if the company believes it
is more advantageous to proceed than the projected results of other
alternatives utilizing primarily cash generated from operations and equity
forward contracts

credit agreement

in november 1999 in connection with the merger wabco terminated its then
existing secured credit agreement and refinanced the then existing unsecured
motivepower credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this
unsecured credit agreement currently provides a 275 million fiveyear revolving
credit facility expiring in 2004 and a 364 day 213 million convertible
revolving credit facility maturing in november 2001 in november 2000 the
company and the banks negotiated a reduction in the 364day facility from 275
million to 213 million primarily due to having credit availability in excess
of current and forecasted needs in an effort to reduce commitment costs and
other related fees at december 31 2000 the company had available borrowing
capacity net of letters of credit of approximately 106 million

under the credit agreement the company may elect a base rate an interest rate
based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor a cost of
funds rate and a bid rate the base rate is the greater of abn amro bank nvs
prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor
rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 875 to 200 basis points
depending on the companys consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios
the cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on abn amro bank
nvs then cost of funds under the bid rate option any participating bank may
propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds which rate may either be
a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor

                                        17
page   19

the credit agreement limits the companys ability to declare or pay cash
dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other
distributions subject to certain exceptions the credit agreement contains
various other covenants and restrictions including without limitation the
following a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness a
limitation on mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions a
limitation on liens a limitation on sale and leasebacks a limitation on
investments loans and advances a limitation on certain debt payments a
limitation on capital expenditures a minimum interest expense coverage ratio
and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio

the credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment
defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material
respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the
company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and
change of control of the company

credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to common
indexes such as libor the weightedaverage contractual interest rate on credit
agreement borrowings was 837 at december 31 2000 to reduce the impact of
interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company
entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt
from variable to fixedrate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts on
december 31 2000 the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled
85 million and effectively changed the companys interest rate from a variable
rate to a fixed rate of 829 the interest rate swap agreements mature in 2001
and 2003 the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance
by the counterparties however since only the cash interest payments are
exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the
counterparties are large financial institutions and the company does not
anticipate nonperformance

9  38 senior notes due june 2005

in june 1995 the company issued 100 million of 9375 senior notes due in 2005
the 1995 notes in january 1999 the company issued an additional 75
million of 9375 senior notes which are due in 2005 the 1999 notes the 1995
notes and the 1999 notes are collectively the notes the 1999 notes were
issued at a premium resulting in an effective rate of 85 the terms of the
1995 notes and the 1999 notes are substantially the same and the 1995 notes and
the 1999 notes were issued pursuant to indentures that are substantially the
same the issuance of the 1999 notes improved the companys financial liquidity
by i using a portion of the proceeds to repay a shortterm 30 million loan
associated with the rockwell acquisition that bore interest at 956 ii using
a portion of the proceeds to repay variablerate revolving credit borrowings
thereby increasing amounts available under the revolving credit facility and
iii repaying the remaining unpaid principal of a 102 million loan from a
prior acquisition

the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and rank pari passu in
right of payment with all existing and future indebtedness under i capitalized
lease obligations ii the credit agreement iii indebtedness of the company
for money borrowed and iv indebtedness evidenced by notes debentures bonds
or other similar instruments for the payment of which the company is responsible
or liable unless in the case of clause iii or iv in the instrument
creating or evidencing the same or pursuant to which the same is outstanding it
is provided that such obligations are subordinate in right of payment to the
notes

pulse note

as partial payment for the 1995 pulse acquisition the company issued a 17
million note due january 31 2004 with interest at 95 to the former pulse
shareholder in january 2000 this note was repaid

industrial revenue bond

in july 1998 a subsidiary of the company entered into a 10year 75 million
debt obligation that bears an interest rate of 55 to provide financing for the
purchase of a building used in the companys operations

principal repayments of outstanding loan balances are due at various intervals
until maturity see note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part ii item 8 of this report

the company is highly leveraged and its debt service obligations will continue
to be substantial the debt of the company requires the dedication of a
substantial portion of future cash flows to the payment of principal and
interest on indebtedness thereby reducing funds available for capital
expenditures and future

business opportunities that the company believes are available the company
believes based on current levels of operations and forecasted earnings cash
flow and liquidity will be sufficient to fund its working capital and capital
equipment needs as well as meeting the debt service requirements if the
companys sources of funds were to fail to satisfy the companys cash
requirements the company may need to refinance its existing debt or obtain
additional financing there is no assurance that such new financing alternatives
would be available and in any case such new financing if available would be
expected to be more costly and burdensome than the debt agreements currently in
place

effects of inflation

general price inflation has not had a material impact on the companys results
of operations some of the companys labor contracts contain negotiated salary
and benefit increases and others contain cost of living adjustment clauses
which would cause the companys cost automatically to increase if inflation were
to become significant

conversion to the euro currency

on january 1 1999 certain members of the european union established fixed
conversion rates between their existing currencies and the european unions
common currency the euro the company conducts business in member countries
the transition period for the introduction of the euro is from january 1 1999
through june 30 2002 the company is assessing the issues involved with the
introduction of the euro however it does not expect conversion to the euro to
have a material impact on its operations or financial results

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

interest rate risk

in the ordinary course of business wabtec is exposed to risks that increases in
interest rates may adversely affect funding costs associated with 274 million
of variablerate debt after considering the effects of interest rate swaps
further described below which represent 51 of total longterm debt at
december 31 2000 and 56 in 1999 management has entered into payfixed
receivevariable interest rate swap contracts that partially mitigate the impact
of variablerate debt interest rate increases see note 6 of notes to
consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report
at december 31 2000 an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest
rates would reduce the companys annual earnings by 18 million assuming no
additional intervention strategies by management

the company has adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no
133 and as amended by sfas 138 accounting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities effective january 1 2001 in the application the company
has concluded that its swap contracts qualify for special cash flow hedge
accounting which permit recording the fair value of the swap and corresponding
adjustment to other comprehensive income on the balance sheet while creating
some volatility in future earnings due to market sensitivity and
ineffectiveness in offsetting changes in interest rates of wabtecs variable
rate borrowings see note 17 of notes to consolidated financial statements
included in part ii item 8 of this report this fluctuation is not expected to
have a material effect on the companys financial condition results of
operations and liquidity

foreign currency exchange risk

the company occasionally enters into several types of financial instruments for
the purpose of managing its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate
fluctuations in countries in which the company has significant operations as of
december 31 2000 the company had no such instruments outstanding

wabtec is also subject to certain risks associated with changes in foreign
currency exchange rates to the extent its operations are conducted in currencies
other than the us dollar for the year ended december 31 2000 approximately
73 of wabtecs net sales are in the united states 74 in 1999 12 in canada
5 in mexico and 10 in other international locations primarily europe see

credit agreement

in november 1999 in connection with the merger wabco terminated its then
existing secured credit agreement and refinanced the then existing unsecured
motivepower credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks this
resulted in an unsecured credit agreement which provided a 275 million five
year revolving credit facility expiring in 2004 and a 364day 275 million
convertible revolving credit facility in november 2000 the company and the
banks negotiated a reduction in the 364day facility from 275 million to 213
million primarily due to having credit availability in excess of current and
forecasted needs in an effort to reduce commitment costs and other related fees
at december 31 2000 the company had available borrowing capacity net of
letters of credit of approximately 106 million in connection with the
establishment of its new revolving credit facilities in 1999 the company wrote
off previously deferred financing costs of approximately 850000 net of tax
02 per diluted share which has been reported as an extraordinary item in
the accompanying financial statements

under the credit agreement the company may elect a base rate an interest rate
based on the london interbank offered rates of interest libor a cost of
funds rate and a bid rate the base rate is the greater of abn amro bank nvs
prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus 05 per annum the libor
rate is based on libor plus a margin that ranges from 875 to 200 basis points
depending on the companys consolidated total indebtedness to cash flow ratios
the cost of funds rate is a fluctuating interest rate based on abn amro bank
nvs then cost of funds under the bid rate option any participating bank may
propose the interest rate at which it will lend funds which rate may either be
a fixed rate or a floating rate based on libor

the credit agreement limits the companys ability to declare or pay cash
dividends and prohibits the company from declaring or making other
distributions subject to certain exceptions the credit agreement contains
various other covenants and restrictions including without limitation the
following a limitation on the incurrence of additional indebtedness a
limitation on mergers consolidations and sales of assets and acquisitions a
limitation on liens a limitation on sale and leasebacks a limitation on
investments loans and advances a limitation on certain debt payments a
limitation on capital expenditures a minimum interest expense coverage ratio
and a maximum debt to cash flow ratio

the credit agreement contains customary events of default including payment
defaults failure of representations or warranties to be true in any material
respect covenant defaults defaults with respect to other indebtedness of the
company bankruptcy certain judgments against the company erisa defaults and
change of control of the company

credit agreement borrowings bear variable interest rates indexed to common
indexes such as libor the weightedaverage contractual interest rate on credit
agreement borrowings was 837 at december 31 2000 to reduce the impact of
interest rate changes on a portion of this variablerate debt the company
entered into interest rate swaps which effectively convert a portion of the debt
from variable to fixedrate borrowings during the term of the swap contracts on
december 31 2000 the notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding totaled
85 million and effectively changed the companys interest rate from a variable
rate to a fixed rate of 829 the interest rate swap agreements mature in 2001
and 2003 the company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance
by the counterparties however since only the cash interest payments are
exchanged exposure is significantly less than the notional amount the
counterparties are large financial institutions and the company does not
anticipate nonperformance

associated with the rockwell acquisition that bore interest at 956 ii using
a portion of the proceeds to repay variablerate revolving credit borrowings
thereby increasing amounts available under the revolving credit facility and
iii repaying the remaining unpaid principal of a 102 million loan from a

8 employee stock ownership plan and trust esop

effective january 31 1995 the company established the westinghouse air brake
company employee stock ownership plan and trust esop to enable participating
employees to obtain ownership interests in the company employees eligible to
participate in the esop primarily include the salaried us employees and as
described in note 7 the esop contributions were intended to supplement or
replace other salaried employee benefit plans

in connection with the establishment of the esop the company made a 140
million loan to the esop which was used to purchase 9336000 shares of the
companys outstanding common stock the esop loan initially had a term of 50
years with interest at 85 and was collateralized by the shares purchased by
the esop company contributions to the esop were used to repay the esop loans
annual debt service requirements of approximately 12 million the company was
obligated to contribute amounts sufficient to repay the esop loan the esop used
such company contributions to repay the esop loan approximately 187000 shares
were to be allocated annually to participants over a 50year period these
transactions occurred simultaneously and for accounting purposes offset each
other allocated esop shares through august 1 2000 were approximately 11
million shares

under a plan that was devised to terminate the esop in order to provide a
comparable retirement benefit structure between the former wabco and motivepower
employees company contributions to the esop ceased august 1 2000 due to
certain regulatory and other administrative constraints the trust and the esop
loan continue in place and the voting rights of the unallocated esop shares
continue to be governed by the trust until the termination has been effected
for accounting purposes the unallocated

defined contribution 401k plan in lieu of company common stock previously
contributed to esop participants and the company anticipates making additional
discretionary cash contributions to former esop participants over the next three
years for which the company estimates the costs to be 2 million per year also
in 2000 the company incurred a 51 million noncash charge for the writeoff
of the related deferred tax asset due to its esop tax benefits that otherwise
would have been realized had the esop continued will not be utilized in future
periods this charge is reported within the caption income tax expense in the

a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the company has
established a valuation allowance for certain net operating loss carryforwards
and for losses anticipated to produce no tax benefit although realization of
the net deferred tax asset is not assured management believes that it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized

the companys net operating loss carryforward for the year ended december 31
2000 is 189 million and will expire in 2010

options to purchase approximately 42 million 700000 and 200000 shares of
common stock were outstanding in 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively but were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options
exercise price exceeded the average market price of the common shares

11 stockbased compensation plans

stock options under the 2000 stock incentive plan the 2000 plan the company
may grant options to employees for an initial amount of 11 million shares of
common stock this amount is subject to annual modification based on a formula
under the formula 15 of total common shares outstanding at the end of the
preceding fiscal year excluding any shares held by the esop or the related
trust are added to shares available for grant under the 2000 plan based on the
adjustment the company had approximately 18 million shares available for 2000
grants and has available approximately 1150078 shares through the end of
fiscal 2001 the shares available for grants on any given date may not exceed
15 of wabtecs total common shares outstanding excluding any shares held by
the esop or the related trust generally the options become exercisable over
three and fiveyear vesting periods and expire ten years from the date of grant

as part of a longterm incentive program in 1998 the company granted options
to purchase up to 500020 to certain executives under a plan that preceded the
2000 plan the option price is 20 per share the options vest 100 after eight
years and are subject to accelerated vesting after three years if the company
achieves certain earnings targets as established by the compensation committee
of the board of directors no further grants may be made under this plan

the company also has a nonemployee directors stock option plan under which
500000 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance through yearend 2000
the company granted nonqualified stock options to nonemployee directors to
purchase a total of 110000 shares

employee stock purchase plan in 1998 the company adopted an employee stock
purchase plan espp the espp had 500000 shares available for issuance
participants can purchase the companys common stock at 85 of the lesser of
fair market value on the first or last day of each offering period stock issued
under this plan thru december 31 2000 was 134241 shares

the company applies apb 25 and related interpretations in accounting for its
stockbased compensation plans accordingly no compensation expense has been
recognized under these plans had compensation expense for these plans been
determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards the companys
net income and earnings per share would be as set forth in the following table
for purposes of pro forma disclosures the estimated fair value is

since compensation expense associated with option grants would be recognized
over the vesting period the initial impact of applying sfas no 123 on pro
forma net income is not representative of the potential impact on pro forma net
income in future years in each subsequent year pro forma compensation expense
would include the effect of recognizing a portion of compensation expense from
multiple awards

for purposes of presenting pro forma results the fair value of each option
grant is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes optionpricing
model with the following weightedaverage assumptions



                         year ended december 31

stock price volatility   4674    3658    2910
expected life years      50      50      50



the blackscholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
fair value of traded options which are significantly different than employee
stock options although this valuation model is an acceptable method for use in
presenting pro forma information because of the differences in traded options
and employee stock options the blackscholes model does not necessarily provide
a single measure of the fair value of employee stock options

years indicated follows
