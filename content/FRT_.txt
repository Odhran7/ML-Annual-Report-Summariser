business objectives and strategies 

while the ongoing covid19 pandemic is impacting us in the shortterm our longterm focus has not changed 

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail focused properties that will 

• provide increasing cash flow for distribution to shareholders 

• generate higher internal growth than the shopping center industry over the long term 

• provide potential for capital appreciation and 

• protect investor capital 

our portfolio includes and we continue to acquire and redevelop high quality retail in many formats ranging from regional community and neighborhood shopping centers that often are anchored by grocery stores to mixeduse properties that are typically centered around a retail component but also include office residential andor hotel components 

operating strategies 

while managing through the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in shortterm deviations our longterm core operating strategy has not changed we continuously evaluate and assess our operating strategies to ensure they are effective and put us in the best position to address changes in the market we actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has generally enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

• increasing rental rates through the renewal of expiring leases or the leasing of space to new tenants at higher rental rates while limiting vacancy and downtime 

• maintaining a diversified tenant base thereby limiting exposure to any one tenant’s financial or operating difficulties 

• monitoring the merchandising mix of our tenant base to achieve a balance of strong national and regional tenants with local specialty tenants 

• minimizing overhead and operating costs 

• monitoring the physical appearance of our properties and the construction quality condition and design of the buildings and other improvements located on our properties to maximize our ability to attract customers and thereby generate higher rents and occupancy rates 

• managing our properties to take into account their impact on climate change and their resilience in the face of climate change 

• developing local and regional market expertise in order to capitalize on market and retailing trends 

• leveraging the contacts and experience of our management team to build and maintain longterm relationships with tenants 

• providing exceptional customer service and 

• creating an experience at many of our properties that is identifiable unique and serves the surrounding communities to help insulate these properties and the tenants at these properties from the impact of online retailing 

investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our longterm weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth and increased value our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories 

• renovating expanding reconfiguring andor retenanting our existing properties to take advantage of underutilized land or existing square footage to increase revenue 

• renovating or expanding tenant spaces for tenants capable of producing higher sales and therefore paying higher rents 

• acquiring quality retail and mixeduse properties located in densely populated andor affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high and that have possibilities for enhancing operating performance and creating value through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting and 

• developing the retail portions of mixeduse properties and developing or otherwise investing in nonretail portions of mixeduse properties we already own in order to capitalize on the overall value created in these properties 

investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion acquisition and development opportunities we consider such factors as 

• the expected returns in relation to our short and longterm cost of capital as well as the anticipated risk we will face in achieving the expected returns 

• the anticipated growth rate of operating income generated by the property 

• the ability to increase the longterm value of the property through redevelopment and retenanting 

• the tenant mix at the property tenant sales performance and the creditworthiness of those tenants 

• the geographic area in which the property is located including the population density household incomes education levels as well as the population and income trends in that geographic area this may from time to time include the evaluation of new markets 

• competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property including gross leasable area gla per capita competition for tenants and the ability of others to create competing properties through redevelopment new construction or renovation 

• access to and visibility of the property from existing roadways and the potential for new widened or realigned roadways within the property’s trade area which may affect access and commuting and shopping patterns 

• the level and success of our existing investments in the market area 

• the current market value of the land buildings and other improvements and the potential for increasing those market values and 

• the physical condition of the land buildings and other improvements including the structural and environmental condition 

financing strategies 

our financing strategies are designed to enable us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its impact on our cash flows we have been maintaining levels of cash significantly in excess of the cash balances we have historically maintained our financing strategies include 

• maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an appropriate pool of unencumbered properties that is sufficient to support our unsecured borrowings 

• managing our exposure to variablerate debt 

• maintaining sufficient levels of cash and available line of credit to fund operating and investing needs on a shortterm basis 

• taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt reduce interest costs and manage our debt maturity schedule so that a significant portion of our debt relative to our size does not mature in any one year 

• selling properties that have limited growth potential or are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio and redeploying the proceeds to redevelop renovate retenant andor expand our existing properties acquire new properties or reduce debt and 

• utilizing the most advantageous longterm source of capital available to us to finance redevelopment and acquisition opportunities which may include 

◦ the sale of our equity or debt securities through public offerings including our atthemarket atm equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares including through forward sales contracts or private placements 

◦ the incurrence of indebtedness through unsecured or secured borrowings 

◦ the issuance of units in our operating partnership generally issued in exchange for a tax deferred contribution of property these units typically receive the same distributions as our common shares and the holders of these units have the right to exchange their units for cash or common shares at our option or 

◦ the use of joint venture arrangements

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

impacts of covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease covid19 as a pandemic while we currently expect the impact to our properties is temporary in nature the extent of the future effects of covid19 on our business operating strategies results of operations cash flows and growth prospects is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future developments none of which can be predicted with any certainty refer to item 7 for further discussion of the impacts of covid19 on our business 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws please see item 1a risk factors  risk factors related to our reit status and other laws and regulations for further discussion of potential material effects of our compliance with government regulation including environmental regulations and the rules governing reits 

the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

• reduce the number of properties available for acquisition 

• increase the cost of properties available for acquisition 

• interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants leading to increased vacancy rates andor reduced rents and 

• adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation 

retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may 

affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

risk factors related to our real estate investments and operations 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic legal andor competitive conditions as well as covid19 may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the closing of stores prior to the end of the lease term or the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result over the past several years we have seen higher levels of anchor turnover and closings in some markets which has caused an oversupply of larger retail spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income as of december 31 2021 our anchor tenant space is 968 leased and 944 occupied 

a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to online shopping may have an adverse impact on our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made online sales a vital piece of their business the shift to online shopping may cause declines in brick and mortar sales generated by certain of our tenants and may cause certain of our tenants to reduce the size or number of their retail locations in the future this risk is partially mitigated by our strategy of maintaining a diverse portfolio of retail properties the trend of retailers utilizing brick and mortar locations for ‘showroom’ and online sales distribution purposes particularly at shopping centers in densely populated areas like ours may further mitigate this risk however there can be no assurance that our shopping centers will not be further impacted by the shift to online shopping as a result our cash flow financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have properties that are geographically concentrated and adverse economic or real estate market declines in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us 

as of december 31 2021 our tenants operated in 12 states and the district of columbia any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the the markets where our properties are concentrated may have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio refer to “properties” item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of the geographic concentration real estate markets are subject to economic downturns as they have been in the past and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both the short and long term 

declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in these states could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties factors that may negatively affect economic conditions in these states include 

  

• business layoffs or downsizing 

• industry slowdowns 

• increased business restrictions due to health crises 

• relocations of businesses 

• changing demographics 

• increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places 

• infrastructure quality 

• any oversupply of or reduced demand for real estate 

• concessions or reduced rental rates under new leases for properties where tenants defaulted and 

• increased operating costs including insurance premiums and real estate taxes 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

• contractor changes may delay the completion of development projects and increase overall costs 

• significant time lag between commencement and stabilization subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy 

• delivery of residential product into uncertain residential environments may result in lower rents or longer time periods to reach economic stabilization 

• substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure and the overall value of the project may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases 

• failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms 

• expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed 

• difficulty securing key anchor or other tenants may impact occupancy rates and projected revenue 

• inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of leaseup 

• higher than estimated construction or operating costs including labor and material costs and 

• possible delay in completion of a project because of a number of factors including covid19 supply chain disruptions and shortages weather labor disruptions construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals acts of terror or other acts of violence or acts of god such as fires earthquakes or floods 

redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

• our estimate of the costs to improve reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low or the time we estimate to complete the improvement repositioning or redevelopment may be too short as a result the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected either temporarily or for a longer period 

• we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify 

• we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully 

• properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project within the time frames we project at the time we make the decision to invest which may result in the properties’ failure to achieve the returns we projected 

• our preacquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property and 

• our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property may fail to reveal various liabilities which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

• economic downturns in general or in the areas where our properties are located 

• adverse changes in local real estate market conditions such as an oversupply or reduction in demand 

• changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants 

• zoning or regulatory restrictions 

• decreases in market rental rates 

• weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weatherrelated expenses 

• costs associated with the need to periodically repair renovate and release space and 

• increases in the cost of adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes associated with one or more properties which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues 

each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

• reduce properties available for acquisition 

• increase the cost of properties available for acquisition 

• reduce rents payable to us 

• interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants 

• lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties and 

• adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation 

retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2021 we held 19 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a “downreit” structure additionally as of december 31 2021 we owned an interest in the hotel component of assembly row we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2021 we held the controlling interests in all of our existing coinvestments except the hotel investment discussed above and the investment in the la alameda shopping center acquired in 2017 we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts pandemics and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

natural disasters climate change and health crises including the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

climate change may add to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures certain of our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the impact of climate change or the occurrence of natural disasters can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operating costs create additional investment costs to make improvements to existing properties to comply with climate change regulations increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

in addition our business is subject to risks related to the effects of public health crises epidemics and pandemics including the 

covid19 pandemic such events could 

• inhibit global national and local economic activity 

• drive inflation adversely affect trading activity in securities markets which could negatively impact the trading prices of our common shares and debt securities and our ability to access the securities markets as a source of liquidity 

• adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition by limiting foot traffic and staffing at their businesses which could affect their ability to pay rent and willingness to make new leasing commitments 

• reduce our cash flow which could impact our ability to pay dividends at the current rate and in the current format or at all or to service our debt 

• temporarily or permanently reduce the demand for retail or office space 

• interfere with our business operations by requiring our personnel to work remotely 

• increase the frequency of cyberattacks 

• disrupt supply chains that could be important in our development and redevelopment activities 

• result in labor shortages 

• interfere with potential purchases and sales of properties 

• impact our ability to pay dividends at the current rate and in the current format or at all and 

• have other direct and indirect effects that are difficult to predict 

such risks depend upon the nature and severity of the public health concern as well as the extent and duration of governmentmandated orders and personal decisions to limit travel economic activity and personal interaction none of which can be predicted with confidence in particular we cannot predict the impact of stayathome and other government orders instituted in response to the covid19 pandemic which vary by jurisdiction or the pandemics short and long term economic effects each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

an increased focus on metrics and reporting related to corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance esg factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

investors and other stakeholders have become more focused on understanding how companies address a variety of esg factors many of those investors and shareholders look to esg rating systems that have been developed by third party groups to allow comparisons between companies on esg factors as they evaluate investment decisions as well as to company disclosures although we participate in many of these ratings systems and generally score relatively well in those in which we do participate we do not participate in and would not necessarily score well in all of the available ratings systems further the criteria used in these ratings systems change frequently and we cannot guaranty that we will be able to score well as criteria change we supplement our participation in ratings systems with corporate disclosures of our esg activities but many investors and stakeholders may look for specific disclosures that we do not provide failure to participate in certain of the third party ratings systems failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain esg disclosures could result in reputational harm when investors or others compare us against similar companies in our industry and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock which could adversely impact our ability to raise capital

risk factors related to our funding strategies and capital structure 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 41 billion of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 3416 million was secured by all or a portion of 7 of our real estate projects as of december 31 2021 approximately 926 of our debt is fixed rate or is fixed via interest rate swap agreements which includes all of our property secured debt and our unsecured senior notes our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing funds available for operations property acquisitions redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future 

• limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares 

• make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements 

• require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt upon refinancing or on our variable rate unhedged debt if interest rates rise 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business 

• limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital debt refinancing capital expenditures acquisitions redevelopments or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms andor 

• limit our flexibility in conducting our business which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility unsecured term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

• relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage 

• restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens 

• restricting our ability to incur additional debt 

• restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage 

• restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates and 

• restricting our ability to consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants if we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the development and redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s 

perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our 41 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2021 approximately 3565 million bears interest at a variable rate of which 3000 million is our unsecured term loan that bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus 80 basis points and 565 million in mortgages payable that bear interest at a variable rate of libor plus 195 basis points and are effectively fixed through two interest rate swap agreements we also have a 10 billion revolving credit facility on which no balance was outstanding at december 31 2021 that bears interest at libor plus 775 basis points we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders we may enter into additional hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any such hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the phaseout of libor could affect interest rates under our variable rate debt and interest rate swap arrangements 

libor is used as a reference rate for our revolving credit facility certain mortgage payables and in our interest rate swap arrangements on july 27 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration limited announced its plan to extend the date that most us libor values would cease being computed and published from december 31 2021 to june 30 2023 the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york organized the alternative reference rates committee which identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative to us dollar libor in derivatives and other financial contracts at this time we can not predict the effect of any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or if sofr or another alternative rate reference rate attains market traction as a libor replacement as libor phases out and ceases to exist we will need to agree upon a benchmark replacement index with the bank and as such the interest rate on our revolving credit facility and certain mortgage payables may change the new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to any libor phaseout furthermore the transition process may result in delays in funding higher interest expense additional expenses and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor all of which could negatively impact our cash flow 

risk factors related to our reit status and other laws and regulations 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be responsible for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances further the presence of contamination on our properties or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole 

in addition changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our development or redevelopment projects without a corresponding increase in revenues which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause the parent company to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income 

• we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

• unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

• we could be required to pay significant income taxes which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders for each year in which we failed or were not permitted to qualify and 

• we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder of the parent company can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status the parent companys declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of the parent companys capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our 

best interests for the parent company to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service “irs” and the us department of the treasury “treasury” changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us and our investors in particular additional technical corrections legislation and implementing regulations may be enacted or promulgated in response to the tax cuts and job acts of 2017 the act and substantive legislative changes to the act are also possible in response to the covid19 pandemic multiple pieces of legislation have already been enacted including the 2020 cares act and there have also been significant issuances of regulatory and other guidance and further legislative enactments and other irs or treasury action is possible no prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions or the direct or indirect effect on us and our shareholders accordingly such new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify to be taxed as a reit andor the us federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of the parent companys declaration of trust and bylaws and certain restrictions in the partnerships limited partnership agreement may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in the parent companys declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

• the reit ownership limit described above 

• authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers preferences or rights to be determined by the board of trustees 

• special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board the chief executive officer the president by onethird of the trustees or by shareholders possessing no less than 25 of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting 

• the board of trustees without a shareholder vote can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest including the reclassification of common shares into preferred shares and viceversa 

• a twothirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust and 

• advancenotice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings 

in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

the parent companys bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

in addition certain provisions in the partnership’s limited partnership agreement the “partnership agreement” may delay or make more difficult unsolicited acquisitions of us or changes in our control these provisions could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of us or change of our control although some shareholders might consider such proposals if made desirable these provisions also make it more difficult for third parties to alter the management structure of the partnership without the concurrence of our board of trustees these provisions include among others 

• redemption rights of limited partners and certain assignees of units of limited partnership interest op units 

• transfer restrictions on op units and restrictions on admissions of partners 

• a requirement that the general partner may not be removed as the general partner of the partnership without its consent 

• the ability of the general partner to issue preferred partnership interests in the partnership with terms that it may determine without the approval or consent of any limited partner and 

• restrictions on the ability of the general partner the partnership or the parent company to transfer its interests in the partnership or otherwise engage in certain extraordinary transactions including among others certain mergers business combinations sales of all or substantially all of their assets and recapitalizations 

we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

• our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income and 

• nondeductible capital expenditures creation of reserves or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income 

in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

general risk factors 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

• general economic and financial market conditions 

• level and trend of interest rates 

• our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital 

• the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 

• changes in our funds from operations “ffo” or earnings estimates 

• changes in our credit or analyst ratings 

• our financial condition and performance 

• market perception of our business compared to other reits and 

• market perception of reits in general compared to other investment alternatives 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends in the current composition or at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

• our financial condition and results of future operations 

• the performance by our tenants under their contractual lease agreements 

• the terms of our loan covenants and 

• our ability to acquire finance develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates 

if we do not maintain or increase or if we change the composition of the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

the parent company is a holding company with no direct operations and it will rely on funds received from the partnership to pay its obligations and make distributions to its shareholders 

the parent company is a holding company and expects to conduct substantially all of its operations through the partnership the parent company will not have apart from an interest in the partnership any independent operations as a result the parent company will rely on distributions from the partnership to make any distributions we declare on our common shares the parent company will also rely on distributions from the partnership to meet its obligations including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to the parent company from the partnership through its ownership and control of the general partner the parent company exercises exclusive control over the partnership including the authority to cause the partnership to make distributions subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of the partnership’s limited partners as described in the partnership agreement in addition because the parent company is a holding company your claims as shareholders are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations to preferred equity holders of the partnership and its subsidiaries therefore in the event of a bankruptcy insolvency liquidation or reorganization of the partnership or its subsidiaries assets of the partnership or the applicable subsidiary will be available to satisfy any claims of our shareholders only after such liabilities and obligations have been satisfied in full 

we currently own 100 of the op units issued by the partnership and are its sole limited partner however in connection with our future acquisition activities or otherwise we may issue additional op units to third parties and admit additional limited partners such issuances would reduce the parent company’s percentage ownership in the partnership 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

we may adjust our business policies without shareholder approval 

we may modify our approach to investment financing borrowing and other operating strategies without shareholder approval a change in the approach to any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

our current business plan focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

we face risks relating to cyber attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cyber attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems as well as attacks on third partys information technology systems that we rely on to provide important information technology services relating to key business functions such as payroll attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include password encryption multifactor authentication frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace frequent backups a redundant data system for core applications and penetration testing however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack a cyber attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees tenants and vendors a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2021 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 104 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 251 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida no single commercial or residential property accounted for over 10 of our 2021 total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 3100 commercial leases and 3000 residential leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 27 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2021 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of tenants could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 104 real estate projects are located in 12 states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2021 

  



leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2021 represented approximately 91 of total rental income 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2021 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2022 and after 2031 in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2021 

  



during 2021 we signed leases for a total of 2193000 square feet of retail space including 2093000 square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 7 on a cash basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 1144000 square feet at an average rental increase of 10 on a cash basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 949000 square feet at an average rental increase of 3 on a cash basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 3757 per square foot of which 6592 per square foot was for new leases and 341 per square foot was for renewals in 2021 

during 2020 we signed leases for a total of 1756000 square feet of retail space including 1666000 square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 3 on a cash basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 595000 square feet at an average rental increase of 4 on a cash basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 1071000 square feet at an average rental increase of 2 on a cash basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 3149 per square foot of which 8412 per square foot was for new leases and 225 per square foot was for renewals in 2020 

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed for retail space in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between the rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including contractual rent on the expiring lease including percentage rent and the comparable annual rent and in some instances projections of percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of rents reported in this calculation as a result of accommodations made to certain tenants to help them to stay open during and after the covid19 pandemic we have found it necessary to exercise more judgement in 2020 and 2021 than in prior years in order to appropriately reflect the comparability of rents in the calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure rent abatement and short term rent restructuring agreements that are a result of covid19 impacts are not included in this calculation tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement fit out of a space as it relates to a specific lease incentives include amounts paid to tenants as an inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements costs related to tenant improvements require judgement by management in determining what are costs specific to the tenant and not deferred maintenance on the space 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 14 to 19 million square feet of retail space each year we expect some rental rates to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic which we started experiencing in the second quarter of 2020 we expect the volume for 2022 will be in line with or potentially exceed our historical averages given a larger amount of vacancy as a result of covid19 although we expect overall positive increases in annual rent for comparable spaces changes in annual rent for any individual lease or combinations of individual leases reported in any particular period may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the annual rents on comparable space leases will continue to increase at historical levels if at all 

the leases signed in 2021 generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2024 and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however our historical increases in rental rates do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2021 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers 













  

1 represents the gla of the commercial portion of the property some of our properties include office space which is included in this square footage 

2 average base rent per square foot is calculated as the aggregate annualized inplace contractual defined as cash basis excluding rent abatements minimum rent for all occupied spaces divided by the aggregate gla of all occupied spaces average base rent is for commercial spaces only 

3 percentage leased is expressed as a percentage of rentable commercial square feet occupied or subject to a lease residential percentage leased is expressed as a percentage of units occupied or subject to a lease 

4 all or a portion of this property is owned pursuant to a ground lease 

5 we own the controlling interest in this property 

6 we own all or a portion of this property in a “downreit” partnership of which a wholly owned subsidiary of the trust is the sole general partner with third party partners holding operating partnership units 

7 we own a noncontrolling interest in this property 

8 all or a portion of this property is encumbered by a mortgage loan 

9 aggregate information is calculated on a gla weightedaverage basis excluding our la alameda property which is unconsolidated 

10 portion of property is currently under development see further discussion in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

11 this property includes interests in four buildings in addition to our initial acquisition 

12 this property includes 39 buildings primarily along washington street and 14th street in hoboken new jersey 

13 the new 500 unit residential building at assembly row was delivered in the second half of 2021 and is currently in the process of being leasedup for the first time consequently these units are excluded from our total residential units and percentage leased statistics if these units were included our total residential units would be 3369 and our percentage leased would be 91 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved from timetotime in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business including but not limited to commercial disputes environmental matters and litigation in connection with transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures we believe that our current proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or results of operations see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions

our common shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “frt” listed below are the high and low sales prices of our common shares as reported on the new york stock exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated 

  



on february 7 2022 there were 2271 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 54 consecutive years the impact of covid19 on our cash flow may impact our ability to pay dividends at the current rate at an increased rate and in the current format or at all 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2021 and 2020 were 425 per share and 421 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2022 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed “forwardlooking statements” see “item 1a risk factors” in this report for important information regarding these forwardlooking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust reit specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida as of december 31 2021 we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 104 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 251 million square feet in total the real estate projects were 936 leased and 911 occupied at december 31 2021 we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 54 consecutive years 

summary financial information 

the following table includes select financial information that is helpful in understanding the trends in financial condition and the results of operations discussed throughout this item 7 and “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 





1 property operating income is a nongaap measure that consists of rental income and mortgage interest income less rental expenses and real estate taxes this measure is used internally to evaluate the performance of property operations and we consider it to be a significant measure property operating income should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap the reconciliation of operating income to property operating income for 2021 2020 and 2019 is as follows 



2 funds from operations ffo is a supplemental nongaap measure see liquidity and capital resources in this item 7 for further discussion 

3 ebitda for real estate ebitdare is a nongaap measure that nareit defines as net income computed in accordance with gaap plus net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization gain or loss on sale of real estate impairments of real estate and adjustments to reflect the entitys share of ebitdare of unconsolidated 

affiliates we calculate ebitdare consistent with the nareit definition as ebitda is a widely known and understood measure of performance management believes ebitdare represents an additional nongaap performance measure independent of a companys capital structure that will provide investors with a uniform basis to measure the enterprise value of a company ebitdare also approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 

the reconciliation of net income to ebitdare for the periods presented is as follows 



4 fixed charges consist of interest on borrowed funds including capitalized interest amortization of debt discount premiums and debt costs costs related to the early extinguishment of debt and the portion of rent expense representing an interest factor excluding the 112 million early extinguishment of debt charge from fixed charges in 2020 the ratio of ebitdare to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends is 29x excluding the 119 million charge related to the buyout of the kmart lease at assembly square marketplace in 2019 our ratio of ebitdare to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends remained 42x 

impacts of covid19 pandemic 

we continue to monitor and address risks related to the covid19 pandemic since march 2020 when the world health organization characterized covid19 as a global pandemic we have been and continue to be impacted by covid19 and the actions taken by federal state and local government to prevent its spread these actions included the closure of nonessential businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home at the onset of the pandemic phased reopenings and capacity limitations and now generally lifted restrictions while the overall economy is showing signs of recovery from the initial impacts of covid19 workforce shortages global supply chain bottlenecks and shortages inflation as well as covid19 variants are impacting the pace of recovery closures and restrictions along with general concern over the spread of covid19 required a significant number of tenants to close their operations or to significantly limit the amount of business they are able to conduct which impacted their ability to timely pay rent as required under our leases and also caused many tenants to close their business permanently while improving our cash flow and results of operations in the year ended december 31 2021 continued to be materially adversely impacted with vacancy levels remaining above historical levels although virtually all of our leases required the tenants to pay rent even while they were not operating we entered into numerous agreements to abate defer andor restructure tenant rent payments for varying periods of time all with the objective of collecting as much cash as reasonably possible and maintaining occupancy to the maximum extent we believe those actions will position many of our tenants to be able to return to payment of contractual rent as soon as possible after the impacts from the pandemic have subsided 

we believe that the actions we have taken to improve our financial position and maximize our liquidity as described further in the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our 2020 annual report on form 10k will continue to mitigate the impact to our cash flow caused by tenants not timely paying contractual rent throughout 2021 we continued to maintain levels of cash significantly in excess of the cash balances we have historically maintained which has adversely impacted our financial results however we believe that such action was prudent to position us with what we expect to be sufficient liquidity to allow us to continue fully operating as our operating revenues begin to return to more typical levels as of december 31 2021 there is no outstanding balance on our 10 billion revolving credit facility and we have cash and cash equivalents of 1621 million 

additional discussion of the impact of covid19 on our results and longterm operations can be found throughout item 7 and item 1a  risk factors

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and involve the use of complex estimates and significant assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

collectibility of lease income 

our leases with our tenants are classified as operating leases when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is considered probable the lease qualifies for accrual accounting when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is not considered probable total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash received determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during a lease term requires significant judgment this determination is impacted by numerous factors including our assessment of the tenant’s credit worthiness economic conditions tenant sales productivity in that location historical experience with the tenant and tenants operating in the same industry future prospects for the tenant and the industry in which it operates and the length of the lease term if leases currently classified as probable are subsequently reclassified as not probable any outstanding lease receivables including straightline rent receivables would be writtenoff with a corresponding decrease in rental income for example in the event that our collectibility determinations were not accurate and we were required to write off additional receivables equaling 1 of rental income our rental income and net income would decrease by 95 million if leases currently classified as not probable are subsequently changed to probable any lease receivables including straightline rent receivables are reinstated with a corresponding increase to rental income 

since march 2020 federal state and local governments have taken various actions to mitigate the spread of covid19 these actions included the closure of nonessential businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home at the onset of the pandemic phased reopenings and capacity limitations and now generally lifted restrictions while the overall economy is showing signs of recovery from the initial impacts of covid19 workforce shortages global supply chain bottlenecks and shortages inflation as well as covid19 variants are impacting the recovery closures and restrictions along with the general concern over the spread of covid19 required a significant number of tenants to close their operations or to significantly limit the amount of business they were able to conduct which impacted their ability to timely pay rent as required under our leases and also caused many tenants to close their business permanently as a result we revised our collectibility assumptions for many of our tenants most significantly impacted by covid19 accordingly during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we recognized collectibility related adjustments of 240 million and 1066 million respectively this includes changes in our collectibility assessments from probable to not probable disputed rents and any rent abatements directly related to covid19 as well as the writeoff of 07 million and 127 million respectively of straightline rent receivables related to tenants changed to a cash basis of revenue recognition during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the revenue from approximately 34 and 35 of our tenants based on total commercial leases respectively is being recognized on a cash basis as of december 31 2021 and 2020 our straightline rent receivables balance was 1107 million and 1033 million respectively and is included in accounts and notes receivable net on our consolidated balance sheet 

other revenue recognition policies 

when we enter into a transaction to sell a property or a portion of a property we evaluate the recognition of the sale under asc 61020 other income  gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets in accordance with asc 61020 we apply the guidance in asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers to determine whether and when control transfers and how to measure the associated gain or loss we determine the transaction price based on the consideration we expect to receive variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of a gain recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of a significant gain reversal and if necessary limit the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk the estimation of variable consideration requires us to make assumptions and apply significant judgment the existence and amount of variable consideration can vary significantly among transactions historically our property sales have had variable consideration of less than 1 of total expected consideration however we had one transaction in 2019 where the variable consideration was approximately 455 million 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as acquired leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to acquired leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any acquired lease value is written off to rental income 

during 2021 we acquired properties with a total purchase price of 4409 million 46 million or 1 of the total purchase price was allocated to above market lease assets and 573 million or 13 was allocated to below market lease liabilities if the amounts allocated in 2021 to below market lease liabilities and building assets were each reduced by 5 of the total purchase price annual below market lease liability amortization increasing rental income would decrease by approximately 25 million using the weighted average life of below market liabilities at each respective acquired property and annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately 06 million using a depreciable life of 35 years 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows taking into account the anticipated hold period including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment we are also required to estimate the anticipated hold period a change in the expected holding period from a long term hold to a short term would cause a significant change in the undiscounted cash flows and could result in an impairment charge actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income

2021 acquisitions and dispositions 

on january 4 2021 we acquired our partners 20 interest in our joint venture arrangement related to the pike  rose hotel for 23 million and repaid the 315 million mortgage loan encumbering the hotel as a result of the transaction we gained control of the hotel and effective january 4 2021 we have consolidated this asset we also recognized a gain on acquisition of the controlling interest of 21 million related to the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the previously held equity interest 

on february 22 2021 we acquired the fee interest at our mount vernon plaza property in alexandria virginia for 56 million as a result of this transaction the operating lease right of use assets and operating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet decreased by 98 million we now own the entire fee interest on this property 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we acquired the following properties 

1 these acquisitions were completed through newly formed joint ventures for which we own the controlling interest listed above and therefore these properties are consolidated in our financial statements 

2 approximately 19 million and 06 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for acquired lease costs and above market leases respectively and 80 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other liabilities for below market leases 

3 approximately 123 million and 26 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for acquired lease costs and above market leases respectively and 147 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other liabilities for below market leases 

4 approximately 116 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for acquired lease costs and 283 million were allocated to other liabilities for below market leases 

5 the land is controlled under a longterm ground lease that expires on december 31 2076 for which we have recorded a 104 million operating lease right of use asset net of a 13 million above market liability and an 116 million operating lease liability approximately 27 million and 11 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for acquired lease costs and above market leases respectively and 36 million were allocated to other liabilities for below market leases 

6 approximately 12 million and 03 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for acquired lease costs and above market leases respectively and 27 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other liabilities for below market leases 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we sold two properties and a portion of three properties for a total sales price of 1416 million which resulted in a net gain of 883 million 

2021 significant debt and equity transactions 

on february 24 2021 we replaced our existing atthemarket “atm” equity program with a new atm equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 5000 million on may 7 2021 we amended this atm equity program which reset the limit to 5000 million the new atm equity program also allows shares to be sold through forward sales contracts we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities fund our development and redevelopment pipeline repay indebtedness andor for general corporate purposes 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we issued 847471 common shares at a weighted average price per share of 10419 for net cash proceeds of 870 million including paying 09 million in commissions and 04 million in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares 

we also entered into forward sales contracts for the year ended december 31 2021 for 2999955 common shares under our atm equity program at a weighted average offering price of 12022 during 2021 we settled a portion of the forward sales agreements entered into during the year by issuing 796300 common shares for net proceeds of 857 million 

the forward price that we will receive upon physical settlement of the remaining forward sale agreements is subject to the adjustment for i commissions ii a floating interest rate factor equal to a specified daily rate less a spread iii the forward purchasers stock borrowing costs and iv scheduled dividends during the term of the forward sale agreements the remaining open forward shares may be settled at any time on or before multiple required settlement dates ranging from june 2022 to december 2022 as of december 31 2021 we had the capacity to issue up to 1750 million in common shares under our atm equity program

outlook 

our longterm growth strategy is focused on growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

• growth in our comparable property portfolio 

• growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and 

• expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions 

while the ongoing covid19 pandemic is impacting us in the shortterm our longterm focus has not changed our comparable property growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals changes in portfolio occupancy and the redevelopment of those assets over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates however our occupancy levels and ability to increase rental rates will be adversely impacted in the shortterm as a result of covid19 we believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment however any significant reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2021 no single tenant accounted for more than 27 of annualized base rent 

federal state and local governments have taken various actions to mitigate the spread of covid19 including initially ordering closures of nonessential businesses and ordering residents to generally stay at home while many of these restrictions have since been lifted they required a significant number of tenants to close their operations or to significantly limit the amount of business they were able to conduct in their stores these closures and restrictions along with general concerns over the spread of covid19 have impacted the tenants ability to timely pay rent as required under our leases and also caused many tenants to close their business permanently while we are seeing signs of considerable improvement these economic hardships have adversely impacted our business and continue to have a negative effect on our financial results during 2021  with very few exceptions our leases require tenants to continue to pay rent even while closed as a result of the pandemic and while many tenants did not pay rents and other charges during a portion of 2020 the majority of our tenants have resumed paying all or a p ortion of their rent andor other charges as their businesses were able to reopen our percentage of contractual rent actually collected has continued to increase since the low point in april 2020 including some tenants paying past due amounts as of december 31 2021 we have entered into agreements with approximately 32 of our tenants based on total commercial leases to defer rent payments to later periods largely through 2022 although some extend beyond while increasing monthly cash collection rates is a positive trend driven by government mandated restrictions gradually being lifted and improved outlook by some tenants we expect that our rent collections will continue to be below our tenants contractual rent obligations and historical levels into 2022 which will continue to adversely impact our results of operations we are also experiencing a lower level of occupancy than in our past largely due to the pandemic which will adversely impact our results until we can release the space and the tenant commences paying rent as well as limit future vacancies caused by the pandemic we are however experiencing strong demand for our commercial space as evidenced by the 21 million square feet of comparable space retail leasing weve completed in 2021 as well as our overall leased percentage at 936 compared to our occupied percentage of only 911 we have begun to see impacts of overall supply chain disruptions affecting the broader economy including significantly longer lead times limited availability and increased costs for certain construction and other materials that support our leasing development and redevelopment activities if disruptions continue to worsen they could result in extended timeframes andor increased costs for completion of our projects and tenant buildouts which could delay the commencement of rent payments under new leases similarly if our tenants experience significant disruptions in supply chains supporting their own products or staffing issues due to labor shortages their ability to pay rent may be adversely affected we continue to 

monitor these macroeconomic developments and are working with our tenants and our vendors to limit the overall impact to our business 

the extent of such impact from covid19 will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted depending upon the duration of tenant closures future operating restrictions and the overall economic downturn resulting from covid19 we may find that even deferred rents are difficult to collect and we may experience higher vacancy levels while the duration and severity of the economic impact resulting from covid19 is unknown we seek to position the trust to continue to participate in the resulting economic recovery 

we continue to have several development projects in process being delivered as follows 

• phase iii of assembly row includes 277000 square feet of office space 56000 square feet of retail space and 500 residential units the expected costs for phase iii are between 465 million and 485 million with spaces being delivered beginning in the second quarter of 2021 at december 31 2021 162000 square feet of office space has been delivered all of the units in the residential building have been delivered and 23000 square feet of retail space has opened 

• phase iii at pike  rose includes a 212000 square foot office building which includes 7000 square feet of ground floor retail space the building is expected to cost between 128 million and 135 million at december 31 2021 approximately 162000 square feet of office and retail space has been delivered of which approximately 45000 square feet is our new corporate headquarters 

• phase iv at pike  rose is a 276000 square foot office building which includes 10000 square feet of ground floor retail space approximately 105000 square feet of the office space is preleased to a single tenant the building is expected to cost between 185 million and 200 million and begin delivering in late 2023 

• the first phase of construction on santana west includes an eight story 376000 square foot office building which is expected to cost between 250 million and 270 million 

• throughout the portfolio we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected total cost of approximately 313 million that we expect to stabilize over the next several years 

the above includes our best estimates based on information currently known however the completion of construction final costs and the timing of leasing and openings may be further impacted by the current environment including the duration and severity of the economic impacts of covid19 and supply chain disruptions affecting the broader economy 

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or units in our operating partnership see corporate reorganization discussion in this item 7 as well as through assumed mortgages and property sales 

at december 31 2021 the leasable square feet in our properties was 936 leased and 911 occupied the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “comparable property” basis information provided on a comparable property basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties that are currently under development or are being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment for the year ended december 31 2021 and the comparison of 2021 and 2020 all or a portion of 95 properties were considered comparable properties and seven were considered noncomparable properties for the year ended december 31 2021 two portions of properties were moved from noncomparable properties to comparable properties one 

property and two portions of properties were moved from acquisitions to comparable properties one property was moved from comparable properties to noncomparable properties two properties and one portion of a property were removed from comparable properties as they were sold and two portions of properties were removed from noncomparable properties as they were sold compared to the designations as of december 31 2020 while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move noncomparable properties to comparable properties once they have stabilized which is typically considered 90 physical occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from comparable properties when the repositioning of the asset has commenced and has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to comparable properties once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment comparable property information replaces our previous same center designations 

year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

  



1 property operating income is a nongaap measure see summary financial information in this item 7 for further discussion 

property revenues 

total property revenue increased 1157 million or 139 to 9512 million in 2021 compared to 8355 million in 2020 the percentage occupied at our shopping centers was 911 at december 31 2021 compared to 902 at december 31 2020 the most significant driver of the increase in property revenues is the generally lifted covid19 restrictions during 2021 as compared to 2020 when covid19 government imposed closures and restrictions were generally still in effect changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below 

rental income 

rental income consists primarily of minimum rent cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent and is net of collectibility related adjustments rental income increased 1167 million or 140 to 9488 million in 2021 compared to 8322 million in 2020 due primarily to the following 

• an 826 million decrease in collectibility related impacts including rent abatements across all properties primarily due to higher collection rates in 2021 as tenants begin to recover from the initial impacts of covid19 and moving a large number of tenants from accrual basis to cash basis in 2020 

• an increase of 322 million primarily from 2021 acquisitions see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and 

• an increase of 254 million from noncomparable properties driven by the opening of phase iii at assembly row in 2021 and our phase iii office building at pike  rose in 2020 redevelopment related occupancy increases at cocowalk the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 higher net termination fees and the opening of freedom plaza in 2020 

partially offset by 

• a decrease of 171 million from property sales and 

• a decrease of 61 million at comparable properties due primarily to lower average occupancy of approximately 141 million lower net termination fees and legal fee income of 51 million and a 21 million decrease in recoveries primarily related to real estate tax recoveries partially offset by higher percentage rent specialty leasing and parking income of 72 million primarily due to the impact of covid19 related closures and restrictions in 2020 and higher rental rates of 67 million 

mortgage interest income 

mortgage interest income decreased 09 million or 283 to 24 million in 2021 compared to 33 million in 2020 primarily due to the payoff of two mortgage notes receivable in may 2021 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

property expenses 

total property expenses increased 265 million or 91 to 3166 million in 2021 compared to 2902 million in 2020 changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below 

rental expenses 

rental expenses increased 272 million or 159 to 1981 million in 2021 compared to 1709 million in 2020 this increase is primarily due to the following 

• an increase of 193 million from comparable properties due to higher repairs and maintenance costs demolition costs and utilities as 2020 had lower costs as a result of covid19 impacts higher snow removal costs and higher insurance costs 

• an increase of 88 million primarily from 2021 acquisitions and 

• an increase of 61 million from noncomparable properties driven by the opening of phase iii at assembly row in 2021 the phase iii office building at pike  rose in 2020 the cocowalk redevelopment in late 2020 and the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 

partially offset by 

• a decrease of 50 million from our property sales 

as a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above rental expenses as a percentage of rental income increased to 209 for the year ended december 31 2021 from 205 for the year ended december 31 2020 

real estate taxes 

real estate tax expense decreased 07 million or 06 to 1185 million in 2021 compared to 1192 million in 2020 due primarily to the following 

• a decrease of 35 million from our property sales and 

• a decrease of 33 million from comparable properties primarily due to a trueup of supplemental taxes at several of our california properties billed in 2020 and prior year tax refunds recorded in 2021 

partially offset by 

• an increase of 31 million from 2021 acquisitions and 

• an increase of 29 million from noncomparable properties due primarily to the opening of phase iii at assembly row in 2021 the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 increases in assessments as a result of our redevelopment activities and the phase iii office building at pike  rose in 2020 

property operating income 

property operating income increased 893 million or 164 to 6346 million in 2021 compared to 5453 million in 2020 this increase is primarily due to the lifting of covid19 restrictions during 2021 which resulted in lower collectibility related adjustments and higher specialty leasing percentage rent and parking income also contributing to the increases were property acquisitions placing redevelopment properties into service the opening of phase iii at assembly row in 2021 and the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 partially offset by lower average occupancy property dispositions higher repairs and maintenance and utilities expense and higher snow removal expense 

other operating 

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense increased 82 million or 196 to 499 million in 2021 from 417 million in 2020 this increase is due primarily to higher personnel related costs 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 249 million or 98 to 2800 million in 2021 from 2550 million in 2020 this increase is due primarily to 2021 property acquisitions accelerated depreciation related to the demolition of one of our buildings in the early stages of redevelopment the opening of phase iii of assembly row and the pike  rose placing redevelopment properties into service and the acquisition of the previously unconsolidated pike  rose hotel joint venture in january 2021 partially offset by 2020 property sales and the lower writeoff of lease related assets for vacating tenants 

impairment charge 

the 572 million impairment charge for the year ended december 31 2020 relates to the shops at sunset place see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

gain on sale of real estate and change in control of interest 

the 900 million gain on sale of real estate for the year ended december 31 2021 is due to the sale of two properties and portions of three properties as well as the 21 million gain relating to the acquisition of the previously unconsolidated pike  rose hotel join venture see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the 981 million gain on sale of real estate net of tax for the year ended december 31 2020 is due to the sale of three properties and one building 

operating income 

operating income increased 1052 million or 363 to 3947 million in 2021 compared to 2895 million in 2020 this increase is primarily due to the lifting of covid19 restrictions which resulted in lower collectibility related adjustments and higher specialty leasing percentage rent and parking income compared to 2020 also contributing to the increases were the prior year impairment charge related to the shops at sunset place property acquisitions placing redevelopment properties into service the opening of phase iii at assembly row in 2021 and the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 partially offset by lower average occupancy higher personnel related costs property dispositions higher repairs and maintenance and utilities expense a lower gain on sales of real estate and higher snow removal expense 

other 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 86 million or 63 to 1277 million in 2021 compared to 1363 million in 2020 this decrease is due primarily to the following 

• a decrease of 62 million due to a lower overall weighted average borrowing rate and 

• a decrease of 32 million due to lower weighted average borrowings 

partially offset by 

• a decrease of 08 million in capitalized interest 

gross interest costs were 1503 million and 1597 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively capitalized interest was 226 million and 234 million in 2021 and 2020 respectively 

early extinguishment of debt 

the 112 million early extinguishment of debt charge for the year ended december 31 2020 relates to the makewhole premium paid as part of the early redemption of our 250 million 300 senior notes on december 31 2020 and the related writeoff of the unamortized discount and debt fees 

income loss from partnerships 

income loss from partnerships increased 93 million or 1154 to 12 million of income in 2021 compared to a loss of 81 million in 2020 this increase is due primarily to the acquisition of the previously unconsolidated pike  rose hotel joint venture in january 2021 and improved operating results at our restaurant joint ventures and at our assembly row hotel joint venture largely the result of the easing of covid19 closures and restrictions 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 34 million or 813 to 76 million in 2021 compared to 42 million in 2020 the increase is primarily due to the shops at sunset place prior year impairment charge and 2021 acquisitions 

discussions of yeartoyear comparisons between 2020 and 2019 can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 11 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations which is largely paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends because as a reit we are generally required to make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income cash dividends paid in 2021 were approximately 3374 million remaining cash flow from operations after dividend payments is used to fund recurring and nonrecurring capital projects such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities we maintain a 10 billion revolving credit facility to fund short term cash flow needs and also look to the public and private debt and equity markets joint venture relationships and property dispositions to fund capital expenditures on a longterm basis 

during 2021 we have continued to see improvements in overall cash collections from tenants as compared to 2020 although not yet at precovid19 levels see further discussion under the outlook section of this item 2 while the overall economic impacts of the pandemic are unknown we have taken multiple steps to strengthen our financial position maximize liquidity and to provide maximum flexibility during these uncertain times including maintaining levels of cash in excess of the cash balances we have historically maintained 

as of december 31 2021 there is no balance outstanding on our 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and we had cash and cash equivalents of 1621 million we also had outstanding forward sales agreements for net proceeds of 2640 million as of december 31 2021 and the capacity to issue up to 1750 million in common shares under the atm program we have no debt maturing until june 2023 

for the year ended 2021 the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility was 196 million and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 09 

our overall capital requirements during 2022 will be impacted by the extent and duration of covid19 related closures and restrictions impacts on our cash collections and overall economic impacts that might occur including supply chain issues cash requirements will also be impacted by acquisition opportunities and the level and general timing of our redevelopment and development activities while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to continue to see elevated levels of investment as we continue to invest in our overall portfolio to better position our properties for a postcovid environment costs to prepare vacant space for new tenants and investments to complete the current phase and start on the next phase of our larger mixeduse development projects although at a slightly reduced level from 2021 largely due to deliveries in 2021 of our third phase of assembly row 

we believe that the cash on our balance sheet together with rents we collect as well as our 10 billion revolving credit facility will allow us to continue to operate our business through the remainder of the covid19 pandemic given our ability to access the capital markets we also expect debt or equity to be available to us we also have the ability to delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

while we have seen improvements from the initial negative impacts of the covid19 pandemic it has continued to affect our 

overall business during the year ended december 31 2021 and we expect it will continue to negatively impact our business in the short term we intend to operate with and to maintain our long term commitment to a conservative capital structure that will 

allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings 

summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 1014 million to 4714 million during 2021 from 3699 million during 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before noncash items and the timing of cash receipts including higher accounts receivable and lower prepaid rent balances in 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

net cash used in investing activities increased 2917 million to 6601 million during 2021 from 3684 million during 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to

• a 456 million decrease in proceeds from sales of real estate resulting from the sale of two properties and a portion of three properties in 2021 as compared to the sale of three properties one building and the two remaining condominium units at our pike  rose property in 2020 

partially offset by 

• a 545 million decrease in net capital expenditures and leasing costs

• 129 million paid in 2020 relating to the partial sale under threat of condemnation at san antonio center in 2019 

net cash provided by financing activities decreased 11 billion to 4530 million used during 2021 from 6617 million provided during 2020 the decrease was primarily attributable to

• 3987 million in net proceeds from our unsecured term loan in may 2020 

• a 2074 million increase in repayment of mortgages finance leases and notes payable primarily due to the 1409 million net repayments of four mortgage loans in 2021 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information the 1000 million repayment of our 4000 million term loan which was amended in april 2021 and the 315 million repayment of the mortgage loan encumbering the pike  rose hotel in january 2021 partially offset by the 606 million payoff of the mortgage loan on the shops at sunset place in december 2020 and the 36 million payoff of the mortgage loan on 29th place both in december 2020 and 

• an 111 million increase in dividends paid to shareholders due to an increase in the common share dividend rate and an increase in the number of common shares outstanding 

partially offset by 

• 5104 million from the december 2020 redemptions of our 2500 million 255 unsecured senior notes and our 2500 million 300 unsecured senior notes with a makewhole premium of 104 million 

• 738 million increase in net proceeds from the issuance of 16 million common shares under our atm program for net proceeds of 1727 million see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details on these transactions as compared to 11 million common shares for net proceeds of 988 million in 2020 and 

• a 108 million decrease in distributions to and redemptions of noncontrolling interests primarily due to the 2020 acquisition of one of our partners interests in the partnership that owns our plaza el segundo property for 73 million 

cash requirements

other than the items disclosed in the cash requirements table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2021 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity cash requirements or capital resources 

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2021 



 

1 on november 26 2019 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest rate on the mortgage loan at 367 

2 the interest rates on these mortgages range from 391 to 500 

3 this mortgage loan has a fixed interest rate however the rate resets every five years until maturity the current interest rate is fixed until july 1 2022 and the loan is prepayable at par anytime after this date 

4 the maximum amount drawn under our revolving credit facility during 2021 was 1500 million and the weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility before amortization of debt fees was 09 

our revolving credit facility unsecured term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility term loan and senior notes additionally we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger a loan default on our mortgage loans if we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay 

the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2021 

  



 

1 our 3000 million term loan matures on april 16 2024 plus two oneyear extensions at our option 

2 our 10 billion revolving credit facility matures on january 19 2024 plus two sixmonth extensions at our option as of december 31 2021 there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 

3 the total debt maturities differ from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized net debt issuance costs and premiumdiscount on mortgage loans notes payable and senior notes as of december 31 2021 

interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income loss which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and statement of shareholders equity cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition the default risk of the counterparty is evaluated by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

as of december 31 2021 we have two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a mortgage payable associated with our hoboken portfolio at 367 our assembly row hotel joint venture is also a party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix their debt at 5206 all swaps were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted our earnings in 2021 2020 and 2019 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding gains and losses on the sale of real estate or changes in control net of tax and impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

• does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which unlike ffo generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income 

• should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance and 

• is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs including the payment of dividends 

we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis however we must distribute at least 90 of our annual taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows 



 

1 for the year ended december 31 2019 dividends on our series 1 preferred stock were not deducted in the calculation of ffo available to common shareholders as the related shares were dilutive and included in weighted average common shares diluted 

2 for the year ended december 31 2020 ffo available for common shareholders includes a 112 million charge related to early extinguishment of debt if this charge was excluded our ffo available for common shareholders for 2020 would have been 3450 million and ffo available for common shareholders per diluted share would have been 452 for the year ended december 31 2019 ffo available for common shareholders includes an 119 million charge relating to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace if this charge was excluded our ffo 

available for common shareholders for 2019 would have been 4777 million and ffo available for common shareholders per diluted share would have been 633 

3 the weighted average common shares used to compute ffo per diluted common share includes operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted eps conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of ffo per diluted common share but is antidilutive for the computation of diluted eps for the periods presented 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2046 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2021 we had 37 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding including 565 million in mortgage payables that are effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2021 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 2566 million if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2021 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 2917 million 

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2021 we had 3000 million of variable rate debt outstanding the principal balance on our unsecured term loan based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10 our annual interest expense would increase approximately 30 million with a corresponding decrease in our net income and cash flows for the year conversely if market interest rates decreased 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 30 million with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

business objectives and strategies 

while the ongoing covid19 pandemic is impacting us in the shortterm our longterm focus has not changed 

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail focused properties that will 

• provide increasing cash flow for distribution to shareholders 

• generate higher internal growth than the shopping center industry over the long term 

• provide potential for capital appreciation and 

• protect investor capital 

our portfolio includes and we continue to acquire and redevelop high quality retail in many formats ranging from regional community and neighborhood shopping centers that often are anchored by grocery stores to mixeduse properties that are typically centered around a retail component but also include office residential andor hotel components 

operating strategies 

while managing through the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in shortterm deviations our longterm core operating strategy has not changed we continuously evaluate and assess our operating strategies to ensure they are effective and put us in the best position to address changes in the market we actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

• increasing rental rates through the renewal of expiring leases or the leasing of space to new tenants at higher rental rates while limiting vacancy and downtime 

• maintaining a diversified tenant base thereby limiting exposure to any one tenant’s financial or operating difficulties 

• monitoring the merchandising mix of our tenant base to achieve a balance of strong national and regional tenants with local specialty tenants 

• minimizing overhead and operating costs 

• monitoring the physical appearance of our properties and the construction quality condition and design of the buildings and other improvements located on our properties to maximize our ability to attract customers and thereby generate higher rents and occupancy rates 

• developing local and regional market expertise in order to capitalize on market and retailing trends 

• leveraging the contacts and experience of our management team to build and maintain longterm relationships with tenants 

• providing exceptional customer service and 

• creating an experience at many of our properties that is identifiable unique and serves the surrounding communities to help insulate these properties and the tenants at these properties from the impact of online retailing 

investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our longterm weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth and increased value our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories 

• renovating expanding reconfiguring andor retenanting our existing properties to take advantage of underutilized land or existing square footage to increase revenue 

• renovating or expanding tenant spaces for tenants capable of producing higher sales and therefore paying higher rents 

• acquiring quality retail and mixeduse properties located in densely populated andor affluent areas where barriers to entry for further development are high and that have possibilities for enhancing operating performance and creating value through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting and 

• developing the retail portions of mixeduse properties and developing or otherwise investing in nonretail portions of mixeduse properties we already own in order to capitalize on the overall value created in these properties 

investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion acquisition and development opportunities we consider such factors as 

• the expected returns in relation to our short and longterm cost of capital as well as the anticipated risk we will face in achieving the expected returns 

• the anticipated growth rate of operating income generated by the property 

• the ability to increase the longterm value of the property through redevelopment and retenanting 

• the tenant mix at the property tenant sales performance and the creditworthiness of those tenants 

• the geographic area in which the property is located including the population density household incomes education levels as well as the population and income trends in that geographic area this may from time to time include the evaluation of new markets 

• competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property including gross leasable area gla per capita competition for tenants and the ability of others to create competing properties through redevelopment new construction or renovation 

• access to and visibility of the property from existing roadways and the potential for new widened or realigned roadways within the property’s trade area which may affect access and commuting and shopping patterns 

• the level and success of our existing investments in the market area 

• the current market value of the land buildings and other improvements and the potential for increasing those market values and 

• the physical condition of the land buildings and other improvements including the structural and environmental condition 

financing strategies 

our financing strategies are designed to enable us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its impact on our cash flows we have been currently maintaining levels of cash significantly in excess of the cash balances we have historically maintained our financing strategies include 

• maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an appropriate pool of unencumbered properties that is sufficient to support our unsecured borrowings 

• managing our exposure to variablerate debt 

• maintaining sufficient levels of cash and available line of credit to fund operating and investing needs on a shortterm basis 

• taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt reduce interest costs and manage our debt maturity schedule so that a significant portion of our debt relative to our size does not mature in any one year 

• selling properties that have limited growth potential or are not a strategic fit within our overall portfolio and redeploying the proceeds to redevelop renovate retenant andor expand our existing properties acquire new properties or reduce debt and 

• utilizing the most advantageous longterm source of capital available to us to finance redevelopment and acquisition opportunities which may include 

◦ the sale of our equity or debt securities through public offerings including our atthemarket atm equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares or private placements 

◦ the incurrence of indebtedness through unsecured or secured borrowings 

◦ the issuance of operating partnership units in a new or existing “downreit partnership” that is controlled and consolidated by us generally operating partnership units in a “downreit” partnership are issued in exchange for a tax deferred contribution of property these units typically receive the same distributions as our common shares and the holders of these units have the right to exchange their units for cash or common shares at our option or 

◦ the use of joint venture arrangements

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including for our taxable years ending on or prior to december 31 2017 any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

impacts of covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease covid19 as a pandemic while we currently expect the impact to our properties is temporary in nature the extent of the future effects of covid19 on our business operating strategies results of operations cash flows and growth prospects is highly uncertain and 

will ultimately depend on future developments none of which can be predicted with any certainty refer to item 7 for further discussion of the impacts of covid19 on our business 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

• the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended which we refer to as cercla 

• the resource conservation  recovery act 

• the federal clean water act 

• the federal clean air act 

• the toxic substances control act 

• the occupational safety  health act and 

• the americans with disabilities act 

please see item 1a risk factors  risk factors related to our reit status and other laws and regulations for further discussion of potential material effects of our compliance with government regulation including environmental regulations and the rules governing reits 

the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

• reduce the number of properties available for acquisition 

• increase the cost of properties available for acquisition 

• interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants leading to increased vacancy rates andor reduced rents and 

• adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation 

retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

risk factors related to our real estate investments and operations 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic legal andor competitive conditions as well as covid19 may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the closing of stores prior to the end of the lease term or the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result over the past several years we have seen higher levels of anchor turnover and closings in some markets which has caused an oversupply of larger retail spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income as of december 31 2020 our anchor tenant space is 962 leased and 941 occupied 

a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to online shopping may have an adverse impact on our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made online sales a vital piece of their business the shift to online shopping may cause declines in brick and mortar sales generated by certain of our tenants and may cause certain of our tenants to reduce the size or number of their retail locations in the future this risk is partially mitigated by our strategy of maintaining a diverse portfolio of retail properties the trend of retailers utilizing brick and mortar locations for ‘showroom’ and online sales distribution purposes particularly at shopping centers in densely populated areas like ours may further mitigate this risk however there can be no assurance that our shopping centers will not be further impacted by the shift to online shopping as a result our cash flow financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have properties that are geographically concentrated and adverse economic or real estate market declines in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us 

as of december 31 2020 our tenants operated in 11 states and the district of columbia any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the the markets where our properties are concentrated may have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio refer to “properties” item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of the geographic concentration real estate markets are subject to economic downturns as they have been in the past and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both the short and long term 

declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in these states could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties factors that may negatively affect economic conditions in these states include 

  

• business layoffs or downsizing 

• industry slowdowns 

• increased business restrictions due to health crises 

• relocations of businesses 

• changing demographics 

• increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places 

• infrastructure quality 

• any oversupply of or reduced demand for real estate 

• concessions or reduced rental rates under new leases for properties where tenants defaulted and 

• increased operating costs including insurance premiums and real estate taxes 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

• contractor changes may delay the completion of development projects and increase overall costs 

• significant time lag between commencement and stabilization subjects us to greater risks due to fluctuations in the general economy 

• delivery of residential product into uncertain residential environments may result in lower rents or longer time periods to reach economic stabilization 

• substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure and the overall value of the project may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases 

• failure or inability to obtain construction or permanent financing on favorable terms 

• expenditure of money and time on projects that may never be completed 

• difficulty securing key anchor or other tenants may impact occupancy rates and projected revenue 

• inability to achieve projected rental rates or anticipated pace of leaseup 

• higher than estimated construction or operating costs including labor and material costs and 

• possible delay in completion of a project because of a number of factors including covid19 weather labor disruptions construction delays or delays in receipt of zoning or other regulatory approvals acts of terror or other acts of violence or acts of god such as fires earthquakes or floods 

redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

• our estimate of the costs to improve reposition or redevelop a property may prove to be too low or the time we estimate to complete the improvement repositioning or redevelopment may be too short as a result the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected either temporarily or for a longer period 

• we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify 

• we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully 

• properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project within the time frames we project at the time we make the decision to invest which may result in the properties’ failure to achieve the returns we projected 

• our preacquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property and 

• our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property may fail to reveal various liabilities which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

• economic downturns in general or in the areas where our properties are located 

• adverse changes in local real estate market conditions such as an oversupply or reduction in demand 

• changes in tenant preferences that reduce the attractiveness of our properties to tenants 

• zoning or regulatory restrictions 

• decreases in market rental rates 

• weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weatherrelated expenses 

• costs associated with the need to periodically repair renovate and release space and 

• increases in the cost of adequate maintenance insurance and other operating costs including real estate taxes associated with one or more properties which may occur even when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues 

each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

• reduce properties available for acquisition 

• increase the cost of properties available for acquisition 

• reduce rents payable to us 

• interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants 

• lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties and 

• adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation 

retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2020 we held 15 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a “downreit” structure additionally as of december 31 2020 we owned an interest in the joint ventures that own the hotel components of pike  rose and assembly row on january 4 2021 we acquired our partners 20 interest in our joint venture arrangement related to the pike  rose hotel we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2020 we held the controlling interests in all of our existing coinvestments except the hotel investments discussed above and the investment in the la alameda shopping center acquired in 2017 we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts pandemics and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial 

obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

natural disasters climate change and health crises including the covid19 pandemic could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

climate change may add to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures certain of our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the impact of climate change or the occurrence of natural disasters can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operating costs create additional investment costs to make improvements to existing properties to comply with climate change regulations increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

in addition our business is subject to risks related to the effects of public health crises epidemics and pandemics including the 

covid19 pandemic such events could inhibit global national and local economic activity adversely affect trading activity 

in securities markets which could negatively impact the trading prices of our common shares and debt securities and our ability 

to access the securities markets as a source of liquidity adversely affect our tenants’ financial condition by limiting foot traffic 

and staffing at their businesses which could affect their ability to pay rent and willingness to make new leasing commitments 

reduce our cash flow which could impact our ability to pay dividends at the current rate and in the current format or at all or to service our debt temporarily or permanently reduce the demand for retail or office space interfere with our business operations by requiring our personnel to work remotely increase the frequency of cyberattacks disrupt supply chains that could be important in our development and redevelopment activities interfere with potential purchases and sales of properties impact our ability to pay dividends at the current rate and in the current format or at all and have other direct and indirect effects that are difficult to predict such risks depend upon the nature and severity of the public health concern as well as the extent and duration of governmentmandated orders and personal decisions to limit travel economic activity and personal interaction none of which can be predicted with confidence in particular we cannot predict the duration of stayathome and other government orders instituted in response to the covid19 pandemic which vary by jurisdiction or the pandemics short and long term economic effects each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

an increased focus on metrics and reporting related to corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental social and governance esg factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks 

investors and other stakeholders have become more focused on understanding how companies address a variety of esg factors many of those investors and shareholders look to esg rating systems that have been developed by third party groups to allow comparisons between companies on esg factors as they evaluate investment decisions as well as to company disclosures although we participate in many of these ratings systems and generally score relatively well in those in which we do participate we do not participate in and would not necessarily score well in all of the available ratings systems further the criteria used in these ratings systems change frequently and we cannot guaranty that we will be able to score well as criteria change we supplement our participation in ratings systems with corporate disclosures of our esg activities but many investors and stakeholders may look for specific disclosures that we do not provide failure to participate in certain of the third party ratings systems failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain esg disclosures could result in reputational harm when investors or others compare us against similar companies in our industry and could cause certain investors to be unwilling to invest in our stock which could adversely impact our ability to raise capital

risk factors related to our funding strategies and capital structure 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 43 billion of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 4860 million was secured by all or a portion of 11 of our real estate projects as of december 31 2020 approximately 907 of our debt is fixed rate or is fixed via interest rate swap agreements which includes all of our property secured debt and our unsecured senior notes our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

• require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt thereby reducing funds available for operations property acquisitions redevelopments and other appropriate business opportunities that may arise in the future 

• limit our ability to make distributions on our outstanding common shares and preferred shares 

• make it difficult to satisfy our debt service requirements 

• require us to dedicate increased amounts of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt upon refinancing or on our variable rate unhedged debt if interest rates rise 

• limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the factors that affect the profitability of our business 

• limit our ability to obtain any additional debt or equity financing we may need in the future for working capital debt refinancing capital expenditures acquisitions redevelopments or other general corporate purposes or to obtain such financing on favorable terms andor 

• limit our flexibility in conducting our business which may place us at a disadvantage compared to competitors with less debt or debt with less restrictive terms 

our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility unsecured term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

• relating to the maintenance of property securing a mortgage 

• restricting our ability to pledge assets or create liens 

• restricting our ability to incur additional debt 

• restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases at properties securing a mortgage 

• restricting our ability to enter into transactions with affiliates and 

• restricting our ability to consolidate merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 

as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants if we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our 43 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 approximately 4565 million bears interest at a variable rate of which 4000 million is our unsecured term loan that bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus 135 basis points and 565 million in mortgages payable that bear interest at a variable rate of libor plus 195 basis points and are effectively fixed through two interest rate swap agreements we also have a 10 billion revolving credit facility on which no balance was outstanding at december 31 2020 that bears interest at libor plus 775 basis points we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders we may enter into additional hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any such hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the phaseout of libor could affect interest rates under our variable rate debt and interest rate swap arrangements 

libor is used as a reference rate for our revolving credit facility certain mortgage payables and in our interest rate swap arrangements on july 27 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration limited announced its plan to extend the date that most us libor values would cease being computed and published from december 31 2021 to june 30 2023 the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york organized the alternative reference rates committee which identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative to us dollar libor in derivatives and other financial contracts at this time we can not predict the effect of any discontinuance modification or other reforms to libor or if sofr or another alternative rate reference rate attains market traction as a libor replacement as libor phases out and ceases to exist we will need to agree upon a benchmark replacement index with the bank and as such the interest rate on our revolving credit facility and certain mortgage payables may change the new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to any libor phaseout furthermore the transition process may result in delays in funding higher interest expense additional expenses and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor all of which could negatively impact our cash flow 

risk factors related to our reit status and other laws and regulations 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be responsible for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property this liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about or were responsible for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances further the presence of contamination on our properties or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect 

our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole 

in addition changes in government legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties and could also require us to spend more on our development or redevelopment projects without a corresponding increase in revenues which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

• we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing taxable income 

• we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 

• unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified 

• we could be required to pay significant income taxes which would substantially reduce the funds available for investment or for distribution to our shareholders for each year in which we failed or were not permitted to qualify and 

• we would no longer be required by law to make any distributions to our shareholders 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from 

owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

legislative administrative regulatory or other actions affecting reits including positions taken by the irs could have a material adverse effect on us and our investors 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service “irs” and the us department of the treasury “treasury” changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof by the irs and the treasury with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect us and our investors in particular additional technical corrections legislation and implementing regulations may be enacted or promulgated in response to the tax cuts and job acts of 2017 the act and substantive legislative changes to the act are also possible in response to the covid19 pandemic multiple pieces of legislation have already been enacted including the 2020 cares act and there have also been significant issuances of regulatory and other guidance and further legislative enactments and other irs or treasury action is possible no prediction can be made as to the likelihood of passage of new tax legislation or other provisions or the direct or indirect effect on us and our shareholders accordingly such new legislation treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify to be taxed as a reit andor the us federal income tax consequences to us and our investors of such qualification 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

• the reit ownership limit described above 

• authorization of the issuance of our preferred shares with powers preferences or rights to be determined by the board of trustees 

• special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board the chief executive officer the president by onethird of the trustees or by shareholders possessing no less than 25 of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting 

• the board of trustees without a shareholder vote can classify or reclassify unissued shares of beneficial interest including the reclassification of common shares into preferred shares and viceversa 

• a twothirds shareholder vote is required to approve some amendments to the declaration of trust and 

• advancenotice requirements for proposals to be presented at shareholder meetings 

in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

• our income may not be matched by our related expenses at the time the income is considered received for purposes of determining taxable income and 

• nondeductible capital expenditures creation of reserves or debt service requirements may reduce available cash but not taxable income 

in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

general risk factors 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

• general economic and financial market conditions 

• level and trend of interest rates 

• our ability to access the capital markets to raise additional capital 

• the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 

• changes in our funds from operations “ffo” or earnings estimates 

• changes in our credit or analyst ratings 

• our financial condition and performance 

• market perception of our business compared to other reits and 

• market perception of reits in general compared to other investment alternatives 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends in the current composition or at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

• our financial condition and results of future operations 

• the performance by our tenants under their contractual lease agreements 

• the terms of our loan covenants and 

• our ability to acquire finance develop or redevelop and lease additional properties at attractive rates 

if we do not maintain or increase or if we change the composition of the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

we may adjust our business policies without shareholder approval 

we may modify our approach to investment financing borrowing and other operating strategies without shareholder approval a change in the approach to any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

our current business plan focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

we face risks relating to cyber attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cyber attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems as well as attacks on third partys information technology systems that we rely on to provide important information technology services relating to key business functions such as payroll attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include password encryption multifactor authentication frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace frequent backups a redundant data system for core applications and penetration testing however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack a cyber attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees tenants and vendors a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2020 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 101 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 234 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida no single commercial or residential property accounted for over 10 of our 2020 total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 2800 commercial leases and 2700 residential leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 36 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2020 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 101 real estate projects are located in 11 states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2020 

  



1 additionally we acquired two mortgages in september 2020 with a net carrying value of approximately 96 million secured by a shopping center in rockville maryland 

2 additionally we own two participating mortgages with a net carrying value of approximately 303 million secured by multiple buildings in manayunk pennsylvania 

leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2020 represented approximately 103 of total rental income 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2020 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2021 and after 2030 in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2020 

  



during 2020 we signed leases for a total of 1756000 square feet of retail space including 1666000 square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 3 on a cash basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 595000 square feet at an average rental increase of 4 on a cash basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 1071000 square feet at an average rental increase of 2 on a cash basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 3149 per square foot of which 8412 per square foot was for new leases and 225 per square foot was for renewals in 2020 

during 2019 we signed leases for a total of 1675000 square feet of retail space including 1557000 square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 8 on a cash basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 793000 square feet at an average rental increase of 11 on a cash basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 763000 square feet at an average rental increase of 4 on a cash basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 4260 per square foot of which 8124 per square foot was for new leases and 243 per square foot was for renewals in 2019 

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed for retail space in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between annual rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation as a result of accommodations made to certain tenants to help them to stay open during and after the covid19 pandemic we have found it necessary to exercise more judgement in 2020 than in prior years in order to appropriately reflect the comparability of spaces in the calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure tenant improvements and incentives include the total dollars committed for the improvement fit out of a space as it relates to a specific lease and except for redevelopments may also include base building costs ie expansion escalators or new entrances which are required to make the space leasable incentives include amounts paid to tenants as inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements costs related to redevelopments require judgment by management in determining what reflects base building costs and thus is not included in the tenant improvements and incentives amount 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 13 to 19 million square feet of retail space each year we expect some rental rates to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic which we started experiencing in the second quarter of 2020 we expect the volume for 2021 will be in line with or potentially exceed our historical averages given a larger amount of current vacancy as a result of covid19 although we expect overall positive increases in annual rent for comparable spaces changes in annual rent for any individual lease or combinations of individual leases reported in any particular period may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the annual rents on comparable space leases will continue to increase at historical levels if at all 

the leases signed in 2020 generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2023 and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however our historical increases in rental rates do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2020 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

on february 8 2021 there were 2307 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 53 consecutive years the impact of covid19 on our cash flow may impact our ability to pay dividends at the current rate at an increased rate and in the current format or at all 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2020 and 2019 were 421 per share and 411 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2021 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

  



distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 distributions on our 50 series c cumulative redeemable preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1250 per depositary share per annum commencing on the issuance date of september 29 2017 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of interest in our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed “forwardlooking statements” see “item 1a risk factors” in this report for important information regarding these forwardlooking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust reit specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida as of december 31 2020 we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 101 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 234 million square feet in total the real estate projects were 922 leased and 902 occupied at december 31 2020 we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 53 consecutive years 

summary financial information 

the following table includes select financial information that is helpful in understanding the trends in financial condition and the results of operations discussed throughout this item 7 and “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” 





1 property operating income is a nongaap measure see results of operations in this item 7 for further discussion 

2 funds from operations ffo is a supplemental nongaap measure see liquidity and capital resources in this item 7 for further discussion 

3 ebitda for real estate ebitdare is a nongaap measure that nareit defines as net income computed in accordance with gaap plus net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization gain or loss on sale of real estate impairments of real estate and adjustments to reflect the entitys share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates we calculate ebitdare consistent with the nareit definition as ebitda is a widely known and understood measure of performance management believes ebitdare represents an additional nongaap performance measure independent of a companys capital structure that will provide investors with a uniform basis to measure the enterprise value of a company ebitdare also approximates a key performance measure in our debt covenants but it should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 

the reconciliation of net income to ebitdare for the periods presented is as follows 



4 fixed charges consist of interest on borrowed funds including capitalized interest amortization of debt discount premiums and debt costs costs related to the early extinguishment of debt and the portion of rent expense representing an interest factor excluding the 112 million early extinguishment of debt charge from fixed charges in 2020 the ratio of ebitdare to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends is 29x excluding the 119 million charge related to the buyout of the kmart lease at assembly square marketplace in 2019 our ratio of ebitdare to combined fixed charges and preferred share dividends remained 42x 

impacts of covid19 pandemic 

we continue to monitor and address risks related to the covid19 pandemic in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a global pandemic and in response to the rapid spread of the virus state and local governments issued orders and recommendations to attempt to reduce the further spread of the disease such orders included shelterinplace orders travel restrictions limitations on public gatherings school closures social distancing requirements and the closure of all but critical and essential businesses and services these orders required closure of all of our corporate offices as nonessential businesses except for those employees who were critical to providing the necessary daytoday property management functions required to keep our properties open and operating for essential businesses such as grocery stores and drug stores and a few employees who were needed to carry out critical corporate functions we transitioned our entire workforce to remote work in march 2020 although some of our corporate offices have reopened with capacity limitations approximately 75 of our workforce continues to work remotely on a regular basis we have not laid off furloughed or terminated any employees nor have we modified the compensation of any or our employees as a result of covid19 and the transition to a largely remote workforce has not had any material adverse impact on our financial reporting systems our internal controls or disclosure controls and procedures 

the government imposed restrictions also required a significant number of tenants who do business in our properties but were considered nonessential to close their operations or to significantly limit the amount of business they are able to conduct in their stores these closures and restrictions have impacted the tenants’ ability to timely pay rent as required under our leases and also caused many tenants to close their business permanently as a result our cash flow and results of operations in 2020 were materially adversely impacted and our vacancy increased above historical levels although virtually all of our leases required the tenants to pay rent even while they were not operating we entered into numerous agreements to abate defer andor restructure tenant rent payments for varying periods of time all with the objective of collecting as much cash as reasonably possible and maintaining occupancy to the maximum extent we believe those actions will position many of our tenants to be able to return to payment of contractual rent as soon as possible after the impacts from the pandemic have subsided 

given the impact to our cash flow caused by tenants not timely paying contractual rent we took actions to improve our financial position and maximize our liquidity those actions included raising 11 billion in may 2020 through a 4000 million term loan and the issuance of 7000 million of senior unsecured notes amending the covenants on our revolving credit facility to provide us operating flexibility during the expected period during which our cash flow will be impacted and raising an additional 4000 million of senior unsecured notes in october 2020 throughout the last three quarters of 2020 we maintained levels of cash significantly in excess of the cash balances we have historically maintained which has adversely impacted our financial results however we believe that such action was prudent to position us with what we expect to be sufficient liquidity to allow us to continue fully operating until our operating revenues return to more typical levels as of december 31 2020 there is no outstanding balance on our 10 billion revolving credit facility and we have cash and cash equivalents of 7983 million 

given the adverse impact on our cash flow we did not commence any significant new capital projects during 2020 and we stopped at least temporarily portions of our capital spend that could be stopped we did however continue investing in a number of our larger projects which were in the middle of construction and could not be stopped without causing material adverse financial impact to the company 

additional discussion of the impact of covid19 on our results in 2020 and longterm operations can be found throughout item 7 and item 1a  risk factors 

corporate responsibility 

we actively endeavor to operate and develop our properties in a sustainable responsible and effective manner with the objective being to drive longterm growth and aid in value creation for our shareholders tenants employees and local communities 

our development activities have been heavily focused on owning developing and operating properties that are certified under the us green building council’s® “usgbc” leadership in energy and environmental design™ leed® rating system which serves as a thirdparty verification that a building or community was designed and built to mitigate its environmental footprint we currently have 15 leed certified buildings and our pike  rose project has achieved leed for neighborhood development stage 3 gold certification the covid19 pandemic has also increased our focus on owning developing and operating healthier buildings to that end our new corporate headquarters space at our 909 rose avenue building has earned a fitwel certification developed by the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc together with the general services administration gsa this certification assesses a building’s impact on seven distinct categories related to overall health and wellbeing these development efforts earned us the sector leader development designation in 2020 from the global real estate environmental sustainability benchmark “gresb” and enabled us to issue our first green bond in 2020 a 4000 million offering that will be supported by certain of our leed gold and silver certified buildings see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

we are also committed to implementing sustainable business practices at our operating properties that focus on energy efficiency water conservation and waste minimization as an example under our solar program that we started in 2012 we have installed onsite solar systems at 25 of our properties with a capacity of over 13 mw and we anticipate adding solar installations at several more of our properties over the next few years to further our ability to source energy from renewable sources our current capacity placed us in the top 5 among real estate companies for onsite capacity in the solar energy industry association’s annual solar means business report we are also actively upgrading lighting at our properties with energy efficient led lighting and installing electric vehicle car charging stations in numerous properties throughout our portfolio currently we are evaluating the risks presented by climate change to help us better understand potential actions we could take to help mitigate our portfolio’s environmental footprint while protecting our longterm investments 

we are also highly committed to our employees and fostering a work environment that promotes growth development and personal wellbeing our four core values are accountability excellence innovation and integrity and we seek to attract and retain talented professionals who embrace those values all of our efforts with respect to corporate responsibility are overseen by our board of trustees 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with our tenants are classified as operating leases when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is considered probable the lease qualifies for accrual accounting lease payments are recognized on a straightline 

basis from the point in time when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease variable lease payments relating to percentage rent are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees are generally recognized on the termination date if the tenant has relinquished control of the space when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement lease concessions unrelated to the covid19 pandemic are evaluated to determine whether the concession represents a modification of the original lease contract modifications generally result in a reassessment of the lease term and lease classification and remeasurement of lease payments received remeasured lease payments are recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining term of the modified lease contract 

in april 2020 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretive guidance relating to the accounting for lease concessions provided as a result of the covid19 pandemic that allows entities to treat the concession as if it was a part of the existing contract instead of applying lease modification accounting this guidance is only applicable to the covid19 pandemic related lease concessions that do not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or the obligations of the lessee we have elected this option relating to qualifying rent deferral and rent abatement agreements for qualifying lease modifications with rent deferrals this results in no change to our revenue recognition but an increase in the lease receivable balance until the deferred rent has been repaid for qualifying lease modifications that include rent abatement concessions this results in a direct reduction of rental income in the current period as of december 31 2020 we have entered into rent deferral agreements and rent abatement agreements related to the covid19 pandemic representing approximately 36 million and 35 million respectively of rent otherwise owed during the year ended december 31 2020 and continue negotiations with other tenants 

when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is not considered probable total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash received determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during a lease term requires significant judgment this determination is impacted by numerous factors including our assessment of the tenant’s credit worthiness economic conditions tenant sales productivity in that location historical experience with the tenant and tenants operating in the same industry future prospects for the tenant and the industry in which it operates and the length of the lease term if leases currently classified as probable are subsequently reclassified as not probable any outstanding lease receivables including straightline rent receivables would be writtenoff with a corresponding decrease in rental income for example in the event that our collectibility determinations were not accurate and we were required to write off additional receivables equaling 1 of rental income our rental income and net income would decrease by 83 million if leases currently classified as not probable are subsequently changed to probable any lease receivables including straightline rent receivables are reinstated with a corresponding increase to rental income 

since march 2020 federal state and local governments have taken various actions to mitigate the spread of covid19 this includes initially ordering closures of nonessential business and ordering residents to generally stay at home subsequent phased reopenings and during the fourth quarter of 2020 additional closures and capacity limitations as infection levels increased in certain areas these actions along with the general concern over the spread of covid19 have resulted in many of our tenants temporarily or even permanently closing their businesses and for some it has impacted their ability to pay rent as a result we revised our collectibility assumptions for many of our tenants most significantly impacted by covid19 accordingly during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized collectibility related adjustments of 1066 million this includes changes in our collectibility assessments from probable to not probable disputed rents and any rent abatements directly related to covid19 as well as the writeoff of 127 million of straightline rent receivables primarily related to tenants changed to a cash basis of revenue recognition during the year ended december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 the revenue from approximately 35 of our tenants based on total number of commercial leases is being recognized on a cash basis as of december 31 2020 and 2019 our straightline rent receivables balance was 1033 million and 1003 million respectively and is included in accounts and notes receivable net on our consolidated balance sheet 

other revenue recognition policies 

when we enter into a transaction to sell a property or a portion of a property we evaluate the recognition of the sale under asc 61020 other income  gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets in accordance with asc 61020 we apply the guidance in asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers to determine whether and when control transfers and how to measure the associated gain or loss we determine the transaction price based on the consideration we expect to receive variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of a gain recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of a significant gain reversal and if necessary limit the amount of 

variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk the estimation of variable consideration requires us to make assumptions and apply significant judgment 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments and general economic and real estate factors certain events such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we calculate depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance and construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 404 million and 9 million respectively for 2020 and 352 million and 9 million respectively for 2019 we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 64 million and 3 million respectively for 2020 and 80 million and 3 million respectively for 2019 we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 11 million and 2 million respectively for 2020 and 24 million and 2 million respectively for 2019 the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 9 million 3 million and 2 million respectively for 2020 and 8 million 3 million and 2 million respectively for 2019 total capitalized costs were 494 million for 2020 and 471 million for 2019 respectively 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and 

include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

variable interest entities vies and consolidation 

we have 17 entities that meet the criteria of a vie and are consolidated net real estate assets related to vies included in our consolidated balance were approximately 14 billion and 15 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and mortgage payables related to vies included in our consolidated balance sheets were approximately 4137 million and 4692 million as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively in addition we hold equity method investments in two hotel joint ventures and one shopping center which are considered variable interests in a vie as of december 31 2020 on january 4 2021 we acquired our partners interest in the pike  rose hotel joint venture see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of this transaction vies are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a vie has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the vie and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the vie the determination of the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance requires judgment and is impacted by numerous factors including the purpose of the vie contractual rights and obligations of variable interest holders and mechanisms for the resolution of disputes among the variable interest holders 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

2020 property acquisitions dispositions and impairment 



1 this property is adjacent to and will be operated as part of the property acquired in 2019 the purchase price was paid with a combination of cash and the issuance of 163322 downreit operating partnership units approximately 05 million and 04 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for above market leases and other liabilities for below market leases respectively 

2 the purchase price includes the assumption of 89 million of mortgage debt and is in addition to the 37 buildings previously acquired in 2019 and was completed through the same joint venture less than 01 million and approximately 33 million of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for above market leases and other liabilities for below market leases respectively 

on september 1 2020 the 606 million nonrecourse mortgage loan on the shops at sunset place matured the mortgage was not repaid and thus the lender declared the loan in default we evaluated our longterm plans for the property taking into account current market conditions and prospective development and redevelopment returns as well as the impact of covid19 on the revenue prospects for the property and concluded we did not expect to move forward with the planned redevelopment or repay the mortgage balance and thus did not expect to be long term holders of the asset given these expectations we recorded an impairment charge of 572 million during the third quarter of 2020 

the fair value estimate used to determine the impairment charge was determined by market comparable data and discounted cash flow analyses the cash flows utilized in such analyses are comprised of unobservable inputs which include forecasted rental revenue and expenses based upon market conditions and future expectations the capitalization rates and discount rates utilized in such analyses are based upon unobservable rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the property based on these inputs we have determined that the 57 million estimated valuation of the property is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 

on december 31 2020 we sold the shops at sunset place for 655 million and repaid the mortgage loan the resulting gain of 92 million is included in the cumulative 2020 gain of 981 million noted in the disposals below 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we sold three properties including the shops at sunset place discussed above and one building for a total sales price of 1861 million which resulted in a gain of 981 million 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we closed on the sale of the remaining two condominium units at our pike  rose property receiving proceeds net of closing costs of 21 million 

2020 significant debt and equity transactions 

in connection with the two buildings we acquired in hoboken new jersey on february 12 2020 we assumed two mortgage loans with a net face amount of 89 million and a fair value of 90 million the mortgage loans bear interest at 400 and mature on july 27 2027 

in march 2020 in order to strengthen our financial position and balance sheet to maximize our liquidity and to provide maximum financial flexibility to continue our business initiatives as the effects of covid19 continue to evolve we borrowed 9900 million under our revolving credit facility representing a drawdown of almost the entirety of our 10 billion revolving credit facility this amount was subsequently repaid when we entered into a 4000 million unsecured term loan on may 6 2020 and issued 7000 million of fixed rate unsecured senior notes on may 11 2020 

the unsecured term loan matures on may 6 2021 plus one twelve month extension at our option and bears interest at libor plus 135 basis points based on our current credit rating our net proceeds from this transaction after underwriting fees and other costs were 3987 million

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

• growth in our comparable property portfolio 

• growth in our portfolio from property development and redevelopments and 

• expansion of our portfolio through property acquisitions 

while the ongoing covid19 pandemic is impacting us in the shortterm our longterm focus has not changed our comparable property growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals changes in portfolio occupancy and the redevelopment of those assets over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates however our occupancy levels and ability to increase rental rates will be adversely impacted in the shortterm as a result of covid19 we believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment however any significant reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2020 no single tenant accounted for more than 36 of annualized base rent 

since march 2020 federal state and local governments have taken various actions to mitigate the spread of covid19 this includes initially ordering closures of nonessential business and ordering residents to generally stay at home subsequent phased reopenings and during the fourth quarter of 2020 additional closures and capacity limitations as infection levels increased in certain areas these actions along with the general concern over the spread of covid19 have resulted in many of our tenants temporarily or even permanently closing their businesses and for some it has impacted their ability to pay rent as of january 31 2021 approximately 98 of our retail tenants were open these economic hardships have adversely impacted our business and had a negative effect on our financial results during 2020  with very few exceptions our leases require tenants to continue 

to pay rent even while closed as a result of the pandemic however many tenants did not pay rents and other charges during the second quarter of 2020 subsequently in the second half of 2020 a portion of our tenants have resumed paying their rent andor other charges as their businesses were able to reopen however government mandated restrictions are still in order in many of our markets our percentage of contractual rent collected each quarter has continued to increase since the low point in april 2020 including some tenants paying past due amounts as of december 31 2020  we have entered into agreements with approximately 32 of our tenants based on total commercial leases to defer rent payments to later periods largely through 2021 although some extend beyond and negotiations with other tenants are still ongoing while increasing cash collection rates is a positive trend driven by government mandated restrictions gradually being lifted we expect that our rent collections will continue to be below our tenants’ contractual rent obligations and historical levels which will continue to adversely impact our results of operations the extent of such impact will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted depending upon the duration of tenant closures operating restrictions and the overall economic downturn resulting from covid19 we may find that even deferred rents are difficult to collect and we may experience higher vacancy levels while the duration and severity of the economic impact resulting from covid19 is unknown we seek to position the trust to participate in the resulting economic recovery 

we continue to have several development projects in process albeit at a slower pace due to covid19 related restrictions being delivered as follows 

• in the 1 st quarter of 2020 we delivered the fully leased eight story 301000 square foot office building at santana row 

• the first phase of construction on the 12 acres of land that we control across from santana row includes an eight story 376000 square foot office building with over 1700 parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 250 million and 270 million with openings beginning in 2022 

• phase iii of assembly row includes 277000 square feet of office space of which 150000 square feet is preleased 56000 square feet of retail space 500 residential units and over 800 additional parking spaces the expected costs for phase iii are between 465 million and 485 million and is projected to open beginning in 2021 

• at pike  rose we have continued construction on a 212000 square foot office building which includes 7000 square feet of ground floor retail space and includes over 600 additional parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 128 million and 135 million at december 31 2020 approximately 61000 square feet of office space has been delivered of which approximately 45000 square feet is our new corporate headquarters 

• our properties are located primarily in densely populated andor affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities throughout the portfolio we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected total cost of approximately 320 million that we expect to stabilize over the next several years 

the above includes our best estimates based on information currently known however the completion of construction final costs and the timing of openings and rent starts will be dependent upon the duration of governmental restrictions and the duration and severity of the economic impacts of covid19 

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through assumed mortgages and property sales 

at december 31 2020 the leasable square feet in our properties was 922 leased and 902 occupied the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies 

comparable properties 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “comparable property” basis information provided on a comparable property basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties that are currently under development or are being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment for the year ended december 31 2020 and the comparison of 2020 and 2019 all or a portion of 95 properties were considered comparable properties and seven were considered noncomparable properties for the year ended december 31 2020 two properties and two portions of properties were moved from noncomparable to comparable properties two properties and one portion of a property were removed from comparable properties and one property was removed from noncomparable properties as they were sold during 2020 one property was moved from acquisitions to noncomparable properties and one property was moved from comparable to noncomparable properties compared to the designations as of december 31 2019 while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move noncomparable properties to comparable properties once they have stabilized which is typically considered 90 physical occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from comparable properties when the repositioning of the asset has commenced and has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to comparable properties once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment comparable property information replaces our previous same center designations 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

  



1 property operating income is a nongaap measure that consists of rental income and mortgage interest income less rental expenses and real estate taxes this measure is used internally to evaluate the performance of property operations and we consider it to be a significant measure property operating income should not be considered an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 

property revenues 

total property revenue decreased 1003 million or 107 to 8355 million in 2020 compared to 9358 million in 2019 the percentage occupied at our shopping centers was 902 at december 31 2020 compared to 925 at december 31 2019 the most significant driver of the decrease in property revenues is the impact of covid19 as many of our tenants were forced to temporarily or in some cases permanently close their businesses resulting in changes in our collectibility estimates and in some cases rent abatement changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below 

rental income 

rental income consists primarily of minimum rent cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent and is net of collectiblity related impacts rental income decreased 1006 million or 108 to 8322 million in 2020 compared to 9327 million in 2019 due primarily to the following 

• higher collectibility related impacts including rent abatements across all properties of 1021 million primarily the result of covid19 impacts this includes the writeoff of 127 million of straightline receivables primarily related to tenants who were changed to cash basis of revenue recognition during the year ended december 31 2020 

• a decrease of 246 million at comparable properties due primarily to lower average occupancy rates of approximately 180 million lower parking income and percentage rent of of 63 million primarily due to the impacts from covid19 related closures lower recoveries of 53 million primarily the result of lower snow removal expense and utilities and lower termination fee and legal fee income of 13 million partially offset by higher rental rates of approximately 93 million and 

• decrease of 144 million from property sales 

partially offset by 

• and increase of 197 million from non comparable properties driven by the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 and the opening of freedom plaza in 2020 and 

• an increase of 195 million from acquisitions of hoboken during the second half of 2019 and early 2020 and georgetowne shopping center in november 2019 

property expenses 

total property expenses decreased 86 million or 29 to 2902 million in 2020 compared to 2988 million in 2019 changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below 

rental expenses 

rental expenses decreased 169 million or 90 to 1709 million in 2020 compared to 1878 million in 2019 this decrease is primarily due to the following 

• an 119 million charge in 2019 related to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace 

• a decrease of 95 million from comparable properties due to lower snow removal expenses and lower repairs and maintenance management fees and utilities primarily driven by the impact of covid19 partially offset by an increase in insurance costs and 

• a decrease of 22 million from our property sales 

partially offset by 

• an increase of 28 million from acquisitions of hoboken during the second half of 2019 and early 2020 and georgetowne shopping center in november 2019 and 

• an increase of 25 million from non comparable properties driven by the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 and the opening of freedom plaza in 2020 

as a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above rental expenses as a percentage of rental income increased to 205 for the year ended december 31 2020 from 201 for the year ended december 31 2019 

real estate taxes 

real estate tax expense increased 83 million or 75 to 1192 million in 2020 compared to 1109 million in 2019 due primarily to the following 

• an increase of 38 million from comparable properties due to higher current year assessments and tax refunds recorded in 2019 from a multiyear appeal and reassessment at three of our properties 

• an increase of 31 million from acquisitions of hoboken during the second half of 2019 and early 2020 and georgetowne shopping center in november 2019 and 

• an increase of 23 million from noncomparable properties due primarily to the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 

partially offset by 

• a decrease of 08 million from our property sales 

property operating income 

property operating income decreased 917 million or 144 to 5453 million in 2020 compared to 6370 million in 2019 this decrease is primarily due to the impact of covid19 which resulted in higher collectibility related impacts lower percentage rent and lower parking income as well as the impact of property sales partially offset by the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 property acquisitions and the prior year charge related to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace 

other operating 

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense decreased 11 million or 25 to 417 million in 2020 from 428 million in 2019 this decrease is due primarily to lower personnel related costs and covid19 impacts including office closures and cancellations of all nonessential business travel and company events 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 153 million or 64 to 2550 million in 2020 from 2398 million in 2019 the increase is due primarily to property acquisitions the opening of our new office buildings at santana row in early 2020 and the write off of lease related assets for vacating tenants partially offset by property sales 

impairment charge 

the 572 million impairment charge for the year ended december 31 2020 relates to the shops at sunset place see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

gain on sale of real estate net of tax 

the 981 million gain on sale of real estate net of tax for the year ended december 31 2020 is due to the sale of three properties and one building 

the 1164 million gain on sale of real estate net for the year ended december 31 2019 is primarily due to the following 

• 851 million related to the sale under the threat of condemnation of 117 acres of san antonio center 

• 283 million related to the sale of three properties and one land parcel and 

• 26 million net gain related to condominium unit sales that have closed at our assembly row and pike  rose properties 

operating income 

operating income decreased 1814 million or 385 to 2895 million in 2020 compared to 4709 million in 2019 this decrease is due primarily due to the impact of covid19 which resulted in higher collectibility related impacts the impairment charge related to the shops at sunset place a lower net gain on the sale of real estate and the impact of property sales lower percentage rent and lower parking income partially offset by the opening of our new office building at santana row in early 2020 property acquisitions the prior year charge related to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace and lower personnel related costs which were largely due to the impact of covid19 

other 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 267 million or 243 to 1363 million in 2020 compared to 1096 million in 2019 this increase is due primarily to the following 

• an increase of 202 million from higher borrowings in response to the covid19 pandemic see further discussions in 2020 significant debt and equity transactions in part ii item 7 of the annual report and 

• an increase of 130 million due to higher weighted average borrowings primarily from the 400 million issuance of our 320 notes in 2019 and 1069 million of mortgage loans associated with our hoboken acquisitions 

partially offset by 

• a decrease of 37 million due to a lower overall weighted average borrowing rate and 

• an increase of 29 million in capitalized interest primarily attributable to the development of phase iii of assembly row and pike  rose 

gross interest costs were 1597 million and 1301 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively capitalized interest was 234 million and 205 million in 2020 and 2019 respectively 

early extinguishment of debt 

the 112 million early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2020 relates to the makewhole premium paid as part of the early redemption of our 300 senior notes on december 31 2020 and the related writeoff of the unamortized discount and debt fees 

loss from partnerships 

loss from partnerships increased to 81 million in 2020 compared to 20 million in 2019 the increase is primarily due to our share of losses from our hotel investments at assembly row and pike  rose largely the result of covid19 related reductions in travel 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased to 42 million in 2020 compared to 67 million in 2019 the decrease is driven by lower net income at our partnership properties primarily due to the impact of covid19 partially offset by higher income attributable to our operating partnership units due to additional downreit operating partnership units issued in connection with the acquisition of fairfax junction in january 2020 

discussions of yeartoyear comparisons between 2019 and 2018 can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 10 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income cash dividends paid in 2020 were approximately 3254 million remaining cash flow from operations after dividend payments is used to fund recurring and nonrecurring capital projects such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities in 2020 our dividends were funded not only by cash from operations but also other sources of liquidity we maintain a 10 billion revolving credit facility to fund short term cash flow needs and also look to the public and private debt and equity markets joint venture relationships and property dispositions to fund capital expenditures on a longterm basis 

we are currently experiencing lower levels of cash from operations due to lower rent collections from tenants impacted by the covid19 pandemic see further discussion under the outlook section of this item 2 while the overall economic impacts of the pandemic are unknown we have taken multiple steps during the last several months to strengthen our financial position maximize liquidity and to provide maximum flexibility during these uncertain times throughout the last three quarters of 2020 we have maintained levels of cash significantly in excess of the cash balances we have historically maintained in march 2020 we borrowed 9900 million under our revolving credit facility representing a drawdown of almost the entirety of our 10 billion credit facility in may 2020 we entered into a 4000 million unsecured term loan and issued 7000 million of fixed rate unsecured senior notes for combined net proceeds of 11 billion we subsequently repaid the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and amended how certain covenants are calculated to provide us more operating flexibility additionally on october 13 2020 we issued 4000 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on february 15 2026 and bear interest at 125 during the fourth quarter 2020 we raised 988 million under our atm equity program after fees and other costs as of december 31 2020 there is no outstanding balance on our 10 billion unsecured revolving credit facility we had cash and cash equivalents of 7983 million and we had the capacity to issue up to 284 million in common shares under the atm program 

for the year ended 2020 the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility was 1385 million and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 15 

subsequent to december 31 2020 we repaid one mortgage loan resulting in only 79 million of debt maturing in 2021 excluding our 4000 million term loan which may be extended for an additional twelve months at our option 

our overall capital requirements during 2021 will be impacted by the extent and duration of covid19 related closures impacts on our cash collections and overall economic impacts including any halts to construction activities that might occur it will also be impacted by acquisition opportunities and the level and general timing of our redevelopment and development activities while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment as we continue to invest in the current phase of 

these projects and are not expecting covid19 related halts in construction activities as we experienced in 2020 with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels more consistent with prior years with an overall increase compared to 2020 

we believe that the cash on our balance sheet together with rents we collect as well as our 10 billion revolving credit facility will allow us to continue to operate our business in the nearterm given our recent ability to access capital markets we also expect debt or equity to be available to us we may also further delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

while the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted our business during the year ended december 31 2020 and we expect it will continue to negatively impact our business in the short term we intend to operate with and to maintain our long term commitment to a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings 

summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities decreased 920 million to 3699 million during 2020 from 4619 million during 2019 the decrease was primarily attributable to lower net income before noncash items and the timing of cash receipts both largely driven by impacts of the covid19 pandemic and payments of annual real estate tax recovery billings 

net cash used in investing activities increased 519 million to 3684 million during 2020 from 3165 million during 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to

net cash provided by financing activities increased 7618 million to 6617 million during 2020 from 1001 million used in during 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to 

• a 6944 million increase due to net proceeds of 7001 million from the issuance of 4000 million of 350 unsecured senior notes and the 3000 million reopening of our 395 unsecured senior notes in may 2020 and 3942 million from the issuance of 4000 million of 125 unsecured senior notes in october 2020 as compared to 3999 million in net proceeds from the issuance of 3000 million of 320 senior unsecured notes in june 2019 and an additional 1000 million of the same series in august 2019

partially offset by 

• 5104 million from the december 2020 redemptions of our our 2500 million 255 unsecured senior notes and our 2500 million 300 unsecured senior notes with a makewhole premium of 104 million

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2020 



 

1 on november 26 2019 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that fix the interest rate on the mortgage loan at 367 

2 the interest rates on these mortgages range from 391 to 500 

3 this mortgage loan has a fixed interest rate however the rate resets every five years until maturity the current interest rate is fixed until july 1 2022 and the loan is prepayable at par anytime after this date 

4 the maximum amount drawn under our revolving credit facility during 2020 was 9900 million and the weighted average effective interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility before amortization of debt fees was 15 

our revolving credit facility unsecured term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility term loan and senior notes additionally we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger loan default on our mortgage loans if we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2020 

  



 

1 our 4000 million term loan matures on may 6 2021 plus one twelve month extension at our option 

2 our 10 billion revolving credit facility matures on january 19 2024 plus two sixmonth extensions at our option as of december 31 2020 there was no outstanding balance under this credit facility 

3 the total debt maturities differ from the total reported on the consolidated balance sheet due to the unamortized net premiumdiscount and debt issuance costs on mortgage loans notes payable and senior notes as of december 31 2020 

interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income loss which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the balance sheet and statement of shareholders equity cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition the default risk of the counterparty is evaluated by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

as of december 31 2020 we have two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a mortgage payable associated with our hoboken portfolio at 367 our assembly row hotel joint venture is also a party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the joint ventures mortgage debt at 5206 all swaps were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted our earnings in 2020 2019 and 2018 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization gains and losses on the sale of real estate and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

• does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which unlike ffo generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income 

• should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance and 

• is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund cash needs including the payment of dividends 

we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows 



 

1 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 dividends on our series 1 preferred stock were not deducted in the calculation of ffo available to common shareholders as the related shares were dilutive and included in weighted average common shares diluted 

2 for the year ended december 31 2020 ffo available for common shareholders includes a 112 million charge related to early extinguishment of debt if this charge was excluded our ffo available for common shareholders for 2020 would have been 3450 million and ffo available for common shareholders per diluted share would have been 452 for the year ended december 31 2019 ffo available for common shareholders includes an 119 million charge relating to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace if this charge was excluded our ffo available for common shareholders for 2019 would have been 4777 million and ffo available for common shareholders per diluted share would have been 633 

3 the weighted average common shares used to compute ffo per diluted common share also includes operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted eps conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of ffo per diluted common share but is antidilutive for the computation of diluted eps for the periods presented 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2046 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2020 we had 39 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding including 565 million in mortgage payables that are effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2020 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 2909 million if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2020 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 3165 million 

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2020 we had 4000 million of variable rate debt outstanding the principal balance on our unsecured term loan based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10 our annual interest expense would increase approximately 40 million with a corresponding decrease in our net income and cash flows for the year conversely if market interest rates decreased 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 40 million with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

our management with the participation of the trust’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the trust’s disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2020 based on that evaluation the trust’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2020 the trust’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level 

internal control over financial reporting 

the trust’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting internal control over financial reporting is defined in rule 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act as a process designed by or under the supervision of the trust’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of trustees management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap and includes those policies and procedures that

business objectives and strategies 

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail focused properties that will 

 our portfolio includes and we continue to acquire and redevelop high quality retail in many formats ranging from regional community and neighborhood shopping centers that often are anchored by grocery stores to mixeduse properties that are typically centered around a retail component but also include office residential andor hotel components 

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

 investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our longterm weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth and increased value our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories 



  

 investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion acquisition and development opportunities we consider such factors as 

 financing strategies 

our financing strategies are designed to enable us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible our financing strategies include 

 employees 

at february 5 2020  we had 308 fulltime employees and 5 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are 

  

subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including for our taxable years ending on or prior to december 31 2017 any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

risk factors related to our real estate investments and operations 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic legal andor competitive conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the closing of stores prior to the end of the lease term or the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result we continue to see higher levels of anchor turnover and closings in some markets which has caused an oversupply of larger retail spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income as of december 31 2019  our anchor tenant space is 975 leased and 959 occupied 

a shift in retail shopping from brick and mortar stores to online shopping may have an adverse impact on our cash flow financial condition and results of operations 

many retailers operating brick and mortar stores have made online sales a vital piece of their business the shift to online shopping may cause declines in brick and mortar sales generated by certain of our tenants and may cause certain of our tenants to reduce the size or number of their retail locations in the future this risk is partially mitigated by our strategy of maintaining a diverse portfolio of retail properties the trend of retailers utilizing brick and mortar locations for ‘showroom’ and online sales distribution purposes particularly at shopping centers in densely populated areas like ours may further mitigate this risk however there can be no assurance that our shopping centers will not be further impacted by the shift to online shopping as a result our cash flow financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we have properties that are geographically concentrated and adverse economic or real estate market declines in these areas could have a material adverse effect on us 

as of december 31 2019 our tenants operated in 12 states and the district of columbia any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the the markets where our properties are concentrated may have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio refer to “properties” item 2 of this annual report on form 10k for additional discussion of the geographic concentration real estate markets are subject to economic downturns as they have been in the past and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both the short and long term 

  

declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in these states could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties factors that may negatively affect economic conditions in these states include 

  

 we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

during 2019  construction was substantially completed on the development of phase ii at both assembly row and pike  rose with portions of both projects opening during 2018 and 2019 additionally we continued construction on phase iii at both projects and our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row a further discussion of these projects expected costs and current status can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the outlook subsection 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 



  

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

  

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2019  we held 16 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a “downreit” structure additionally we own an interest in the joint ventures that own the hotel components of pike  rose and assembly row we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2019  we held the controlling interests in all of our existing coinvestments except the hotel investments discussed above and the investment in the la alameda shopping center acquired in 2017 we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if 

  

any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

natural disasters and climate change could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

climate change may add to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures certain of our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the impact of climate change or the occurrence of natural disasters can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operating costs create additional investment costs to make improvements to existing properties to comply with climate change regulations increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

risk factors related to our funding strategies and capital structure 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2019  all of our 34 billion of debt outstanding has a fixed rate or is fixed via interest rate swap agreements of that outstanding debt approximately 5472 million was secured by all or a portion of 13 of our real estate projects our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 



  

 as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants if we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our 34 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2019  approximately 565 million bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus 1950 basis points and is effectively fixed through two interest rate swap agreements we also have a 10 billion revolving credit facility on which no balance was outstanding at december 31 2019  that bears interest at libor plus 775 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders we may enter into additional hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any such hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the phaseout of libor could affect interest rates under our variable rate debt and interest rate swap arrangements 

libor is used as a reference rate for our revolving credit facility certain mortgage payables and in our interest rate swap arrangements on july 27 2017 the united kingdoms financial conduct authority announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 it is unclear if libor will cease to exist at that time if a new method of calculating libor will be established or if an alternative reference rate will be established the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york organized the alternative reference rates committee which identified the 

  

secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative to us dollar libor in derivatives and other financial contracts we are not able to predict when libor will cease to be available or if sofr or another alternative rate reference rate attains market traction as a libor replacement if libor ceases to exist we will need to agree upon a benchmark replacement index with the bank and as such the interest rate on our revolving credit facility and certain mortgage payables may change the new rate may not be as favorable as those in effect prior to any libor phaseout furthermore the transition process may result in delays in funding higher interest expense additional expenses and increased volatility in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor all of which could negatively impact our cash flow 

we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

  

risk factors related to our company and the market price of our securities 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

  

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

we may adjust our business policies without shareholder approval 

we may modify our approach to investment financing borrowing and other operating strategies without shareholder approval a change in the approach to any of these items could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

our current business plan focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

we face risks relating to cyber attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cyber attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems as well as attacks on third partys information technology systems that we rely on to provide important information technology services relating to key business functions such as payroll attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include password encryption frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace frequent backups a redundant data system for core applications and penetration testing however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack a cyber attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees tenants and vendors a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations 

risk factors related to our reit status and other laws and regulations 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be 

  

forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the 

  

outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

us federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect reits both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to anticipate 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” signed into law on december 22 2017 represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes while we currently do not expect the 2017 tax act will have a significant direct impact on us it may impact us indirectly as our tenants and the jurisdictions in which we do business as well as the overall investment thesis for reits may be impacted both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to predict additionally the overall impact of the 2017 tax act depends on future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by federal tax authorities as well as changes in state and local taxation in response to the 2017 tax act and it is possible that such future interpretations regulations and other changes could adversely impact us 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2019  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 104 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 237 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida no single commercial or residential property accounted for over 10 of our 2019 total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 3000 commercial leases and 2700 residential leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 26 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2019  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 104 real estate projects are located in 12 states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2019  

  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2019  represented approximately 91 of total rental income 

  

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2019 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2020 and after 2029 in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2019  

  



during 2019  we signed leases for a total of 1675000 square feet of retail space including 1557000 square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 8 on a cash basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 793000 square feet at an average rental increase of 11 on a cash basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 763000 square feet at an average rental increase of 4 on a cash basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 4260 per square foot of which 8124 per square foot was for new leases and 243 per square foot was for renewals in 2019  

during 2018  we signed leases for a total of 1972000 square feet of retail space including 1874000 square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 12 on a cash basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 796000 square feet at an average rental increase of 25 on a cash basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 1078000 square feet at an average rental increase of 4 on a cash basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 2709 per square foot of which 6102 per square foot was for new leases and 202 per square foot was for renewals in 2018  

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed for retail space in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure tenant improvements and incentives include the total 

dollars committed for the improvement fit out of a space as it relates to a specific lease and except for redevelopments may 

also include base building costs ie expansion escalators or new entrances which are required to make the space leasable 

incentives include amounts paid to tenants as inducement to sign a lease that do not represent building improvements costs 

related to redevelopments require judgment by management in determining what reflects base building costs and thus is not 

included in the tenant improvements and incentives amount 

the leases signed in 2019 generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2022 and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 13 to 19 million square feet of retail space each year and expect the volume for 2020 will be in line with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however 

  

changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all 

  

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2019  except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

we are involved from timetotime in various legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business including but not limited to commercial disputes environmental matters and litigation in connection with transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures we believe that our current proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity or results of operations see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussions

our common shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “frt” listed below are the high and low sales prices of our common shares as reported on the new york stock exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated 

  



on february 5 2020  there were 2378 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 52 consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2019 and 2018 were 411 per share and 402 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2020 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

  



distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 distributions on our 50 series c cumulative redeemable 

  

preferred shares which were issued september 29 2017 were declared at the rate of 125 per depositary share per annum and the first payment date was january 16 2018 in 2018  dividends paid per depositary share were 1306 due to the timing of issuance we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of interest in our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit

under the terms of various operating partnership agreements of certain of our affiliated limited partnerships the interest of limited partners in those limited partnerships may be redeemed subject to certain conditions for cash or an equivalent number of our common shares at our option during the three months ended december 31 2019  we issued 17035 common shares in connection with the redemption of operating partnership units such shares of common stock were issued in reliance on section 4a2 of the securities act any other equity securities sold by us during 2019 that were not registered have been previously reported in a quarterly report on form 10q 

purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers 

during 2019  10501 restricted common shares were forfeited by former employees

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may 

  

affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

policy beginning january 1 2019 with our adoption of accounting standards codification asc 842 leases 

our leases with our tenants are classified as operating leases when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is considered probable the lease qualifies for accrual accounting lease payments are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease variable lease payments relating to percentage rent are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

when collection of substantially all lease payments during the lease term is not considered probable total lease revenue is limited to the lesser of revenue recognized under accrual accounting or cash received determining the probability of collection of substantially all lease payments during lease term requires judgment this determination is impacted by numerous factors including our assessment of the tenant’s credit worthiness economic conditions our historical experience with the tenant and tenants operating in the same industry and the length of the lease term if leases currently classified as probable are subsequently reclassified as not probable any outstanding lease receivables including straightline rent receivables would be writtenoff with a corresponding decrease in rental income for example in the event that our collectability determinations were not accurate and we were required to write off additional receivables equaling 1 of rental income our rental income and net income would decrease by 93 million  

policy prior to january 1 2019 

prior to january 1 2019 management estimates of collectability were considered when reserving for billed and accrued lease receivables and straightline rent receivables full and partial reserves were recorded when determined to be appropriate with a corresponding charge to bad debt expense the primary impact of the adoption of asc 842 “leases” on our recognition of lease revenue relates to the upfront and ongoing assessment of the collectability of substantially all lease payments required by the new standard 

other revenue recognition policies 

when we enter into a transaction to sell a property or a portion of a property we evaluate the recognition of the sale under asc 61020 other income  gains and losses from the derecognition of nonfinancial assets in accordance with asc 61020 we apply the guidance in asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers to determine whether and when control transfers and how to measure the associated gain or loss we determine the transaction price based on the consideration we expect to receive variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of a gain recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of a significant gain reversal and if necessary limit the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk the estimation of variable consideration requires us to make assumptions and apply significant judgment 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments and general economic and real estate factors certain events such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the 

  

economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we calculate depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance and construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 352 million and 9 million  respectively for 2019 and 274 million and 8 million  respectively for 2018  we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 80 million and 3 million  respectively for 2019 and 62 million and 3 million  respectively for 2018  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 24 million and 2 million  respectively for 2019 and 20 million and 6 million  respectively for 2018  the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 8 million  3 million  and 2 million  respectively for 2019 and 7 million  3 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2018  total capitalized costs were 471 million for 2019 and 373 million for 2018  respectively 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

variable interest entities vies and consolidation 

we have 18 entities that meet the criteria of a vie and are consolidated net real estate assets related to vies included in our consolidated balance were approximately 15 billion for both december 31 2019 and 2018  and mortgage payables related to vies included in our consolidated balance sheets were approximately 4692 million and 4444 million  as of december 31 2019 and 2018  respectively in addition we hold equity method investments in two hotel joint ventures and one shopping center which are considered variable interests in a vie vies are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a vie has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the vie and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the vie the 

  

determination of the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance requires judgment and is impacted by numerous factors including the purpose of the vie contractual rights and obligations of variable interest holders and mechanisms for the resolution of disputes among the variable interest holders 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis previous experience in our portfolio and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income

2019 property acquisitions 



1 these acquisitions were completed through a newly formed joint venture for which we own a 90 interest this property includes 123 residential units in addition to the gla in the table above 

  

2019 property dispositions 

on december 11 2019  we received 1547 million in net proceeds related to the sale under the threat of condemnation of 117 acres of san antonio center to a local school district the condemning authority as part of the transaction the condemning authority will commence condemnation proceedings in order to terminate all existing leases they assumed at closing we have indemnified the condemning authority for all costs incurred related to the condemnation proceedings including any payments required to tenants at the property and expect the process will take several years to complete the consideration in the transaction is considered variable because we have agreed to indemnify the condemning authority for these costs consequently we have recorded a liability of 455 million to reflect our estimate of the final consideration net of estimated condemnation proceeding costs and other transaction related costs the resulting net gain on sale is approximately 851 million  

during the year ended december 31 2019  we sold three properties and one land parcel for a net sales price of 1490 million  which resulted in a net gain of 283 million  

during the year ended december 31 2019  we closed on the sale of 43 condominium units at our assembly row and pike  rose properties combined received proceeds net of closing costs of 201 million  and recognized a gain of 26 million  net of income taxes the cost basis for the remaining condominium units as of december 31 2019 is 17 million  and is included in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 

2019 significant debt and equity transactions 

on january 31 2019  we repaid the 203 million mortgage loan on rollingwood apartments at par prior to its original maturity date 

on june 7 2019  we issued 3000 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on june 15 2029 and bear interest at 320  the notes were offered at 99838 of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 3219  on august 21 2019  we issued an additional 1000 million senior notes of the same series and with the same terms the august notes were offered at 103813 of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of 2744  the combined net proceeds from the note offerings after net issuance premium underwriting fees and other costs were 3999 million  which were primarily used to repay our 2750 million unsecured term loan at par on june 7 2019 and for general corporate purposes 

on july 25 2019  we amended our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity to 10 billion and extend the maturity date to january 19 2024 plus two sixmonth extensions at our option under the amended facility the spread over libor is 775 basis points based on our current credit rating in addition we have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 15 billion 

in connection with our hoboken new jersey acquisitions in 2019  we assumed mortgage loans with a face amount of 416 million and a fair value of 429 million  and entered into a new mortgage loan with a face amount of 565 million  the mortgage loans associated with our hoboken acquisitions have the following contractual terms 



  

 on august 2 2019  we acquired the 101 redeemable noncontrolling interest in the partnership that owns our montrose crossing shopping center for 100 million  bringing our ownership interest to 100  

we have an atthemarket “atm” equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 4000 million  we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities fund our development and redevelopment pipeline repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility andor for general corporate purposes for the year ended december 31 2019  we sold 1069699 common shares at a weighted average 

  

price per share of 13471 for net cash proceeds of 1427 million and paid 12 million in commissions and 02 million in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares as of december 31 2019  we had the capacity to issue up to 1283 million in common shares under our atm equity program 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our comparable property growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals changes in portfolio occupancy and the redevelopment of those assets over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates we continue to see relatively strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces however the time it takes to complete new lease deals is longer as tenants have become more selective and more deliberate in their decisionmaking process we have also experienced extended periods of time for some government agencies to process permits and inspections further delaying rent commencement on newly leased spaces additionally we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces and have seen an uptick in the number of retail tenants vacating prior to the end of their lease term andor filing for bankruptcy we believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment however any significant reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2019  no single tenant accounted for more than 26 of annualized base rent 

our properties are located primarily in densely populated andor affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected cost of approximately 315 million that we expect to stabilize in the next several years 

we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row and are under construction on an eight story 301000 square foot office building which will include an additional 20000 square feet of retail space and 1300 parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 210 million and 220 million to be delivered in 2020 and the office portion is 100 leased after current phases we have approximately 4 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 321000 square feet of commercial space 

additionally we control 12 acres of land across from santana row and we are proceeding with the first phase of construction on this land which includes an eight story 376000 square foot office building with over 1700 parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 250 million and 270 million with openings beginning in 2022 in addition the land also has approximately 604000 square feet of remaining commercial space entitlements 

phase ii of assembly row includes approximately 161000 square feet of retail space 447 residential units and a 158 room boutique hotel owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner as of december 31 2019 phase ii is substantially complete with expected final costs of 298 million to 302 million phase ii also included 122 forsale condominium units which had a total cost of 81 million and have all have been sold as of december 31 2019 

additionally we are under construction on phase iii of assembly row which will include 277000 square feet of office space of which 150000 square feet is preleased 56000 square feet of retail space 500 residential units and over 800 additional parking spaces the expected costs for phase iii are between 465 million and 485 million and is projected to open beginning in 2021 

phase ii of pike  rose includes approximately 219000 square feet of retail space 272 residential units and a 177 room boutique hotel owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner and is substantially complete as of december 31 2019 the total cost for this portion of phase ii was 208 million as of december 31 2019 we closed on the sale of 97 of the 99 forsale condominium units in phase ii the condominiums had a final cost of 62 million 

additionally at pike  rose we commenced construction on a 212000 square foot office building which includes 4000 square feet of ground floor retail space and will include over 600 additional parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 128 million and 135 million and is projected to open beginning in 2020 

  

we invested 258 million in assembly row pike  rose and santana row in 2019  net of public funding and expect to invest between 320 million and 350 million in assembly row pike  rose and santana row in 2020  

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through assumed mortgages and property sales 

at december 31 2019  the leasable square feet in our properties was 942 leased and 925 occupied the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies 

comparable properties 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “comparable property” basis information provided on a comparable property basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties that are currently under development or are being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment for the year ended december 31 2019 and the comparison of 2019 and 2018  all or a portion of 95 properties were considered comparable properties and eight properties were considered noncomparable properties for the year ended december 31 2019  seven properties were moved from acquisitions to comparable properties two properties were removed from comparable properties as they were sold during 2019 one property was moved from acquisitions to noncomparable properties and one portion of a property was moved from noncomparable properties to comparable properties compared to the designations as of december 31 2018  while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move noncomparable properties to comparable properties once they have stabilized which is typically considered 90 physical occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from comparable properties when the repositioning of the asset has commenced and has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to comparable properties once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment comparable property information replaces our previous same center designations 

  

year ended december 31 2019 compared to year ended december 31 2018 

  



1 property operating income is a nongaap financial measure see item 6 selected financial data for further discussion 

property revenues 

total property revenue increased 204 million  or 22  to 9358 million in 2019 compared to 9154 million in 2018  the percentage occupied at our shopping centers was 925 at december 31 2019 compared to 936 at december 31 2018  changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below 

rental income 

rental income consists primarily of minimum rent cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent rental income increased 205 million  or 22  to 9327 million in 2019 compared to 9123 million in 2018 due primarily to the following 

 partially offset by 

 property expenses 

total property expenses increased 109 million  or 38  to 2988 million in 2019 compared to 2879 million in 2018  changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below 

  

rental expenses 

rental expenses increased 147 million  or 85  to 1878 million in 2019 compared to 1731 million in 2018  this increase is primarily due to the following 

 partially offset by 

 as a result of the changes in rental income and rental expenses as discussed above rental expenses as a percentage of rental income increased to 201 for the year ended december 31 2019 from 190 for the year ended december 31 2018  

real estate taxes 

real estate tax expense decreased 38 million  or 34 to 1109 million in 2019 compared to 1148 million in 2018 due primarily to the following 

 partially offset by 

 property operating income 

property operating income increased 95 million  or 15  to 6370 million in 2019 compared to 6276 million in 2018  this increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at comparable properties the opening of phase ii at assembly row and pike  rose and our 2019 acquisitions partially offset by the charge related to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace and property sales 

other operating 

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense increased 92 million  or 272  to 428 million in 2019 from 336 million in 2018  this increase is due primarily to higher leasing related costs as certain costs can no longer be capitalized as a result of the new lease accounting standard see note 2 for additional disclosure and higher personnel costs 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense decreased 45 million  or 18  to 2398 million in 2019 from 2442 million in 2018  this decrease is primarily due to lower accelerated depreciation related to tenants who vacated in advance of their lease expiration and property sales partially offset by phase ii of assembly row and pike  rose being placed in service and our 2019 acquisitions 

gain on sale of real estate net 

the 1164 million gain on sale of real estate net for the year ended december 31 2019 is primarily due to the following 



  

 the 119 million gain on sale of real estate net for the year ended december 31 2018 is primarily due to the following 

 operating income 

operating income increased 1093 million  or 302  to 4709 million in 2019 compared to 3616 million in 2018  this increase is due primarily to higher gains on the sale of real estate in 2019 growth in earnings at our comparable properties and the opening of phase ii of assembly row and pike  rose partially offset by the charge related to the buyout of a lease at assembly square marketplace higher leasing and personnel related costs and property sales 

other 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 05 million  or 05  to 1096 million in 2019 compared to 1102 million in 2018  this decrease is due primarily to a 16 million increase in capitalized interest partially offset by a 11 million increase due to a higher weighted average borrowing rate in 2019 

gross interest costs were 1301 million and 1290 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively capitalized interest was 205 million and 188 million in 2019 and 2018  respectively 

loss from partnerships 

loss from partnerships decreased to 20 million in 2019 compared to 34 million in 2018  this decrease is due primarily to improved operating results at our assembly row and pike  rose hotel joint ventures which opened in august 2018 and march 2018 respectively 

discussions of yeartoyear comparisons between 2018 and 2017 can be found in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018 filed with the securities and exchange commission on february 13 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

at december 31 2019  we had cash and cash equivalents of 1274 million and no outstanding balance on our unsecured revolving credit facility for the year ended 2019  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 1165 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 268 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 32  

on june 7 2019 we issued 3000 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on june 15 2029 and bear interest at 320 on august 21 2019 we issued an additional 1000 million senior notes of the same series and with the same terms 

  

the combined net proceeds of 3999 million were primarily used to repay our 2750 million unsecured term loan which was scheduled to mature in november 2019 during 2020 we have only 606 million of debt maturing 

on july 25 2019 we amended our revolving credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity from 8000 million to 10 billion lower our spread over libor from 825 basis points to 775 basis points and extend the maturity date to january 19 2024 plus two sixmonth extensions at our option in additionwe have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 15 billion 

during 2019 we raised 1427 million under our atm equity program after fees and other costs and as of december 31 2019  we had the capacity to issue up to 1283 million in common shares under the atm program we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm program our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2020 will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment as we continue to invest in the next phase of these projects with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years our capital investments will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor our revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities decreased 548 million to 4619 million during 2019 from 5167 million during 2018  the decrease was primarily attributable to the 145 million lease buyout payment at assembly square marketplace in august 2019 124 million in net proceeds in 2018 from the freedom plaza new market tax credit transaction see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and the timing of cash receipts 

net cash used in investing activities increased 1243 million to 3165 million during 2019 from 1922 million during 2018  the increase was primarily attributable to 



  

partially offset by 

 net cash used in financing activities decreased 1412 million to 1001 million during 2019 from 2413 million during 2018  the decrease was primarily attributable to 

 partially offset by 

 contractual commitments 

the following table provides a summary of our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2019  

  



  

 in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed the following potential commitments exist 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement a minority partner has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its 2663 interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value if the other minority partner defaults in their obligation we must purchase the full interest based on management’s current 

  

estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2019  our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 79 million to 84 million  

b under the terms of various other partnership agreements the partners have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2019  a total of 609584 operating partnership units are outstanding 

c two of the members in plaza el segundo have the right to require us to purchase their 100 and 118 ownership interests at the interests thencurrent fair market value if the members fail to exercise their put options we have the right to purchase each of their interests on or after december 30 2026 at fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2019  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 30 million to 33 million  

d the other member in the grove at shrewsbury and brook 35 has the right to require us to purchase all of its approximately 41 interest in the grove at shrewsbury and approximately 65 interest in brook 35 at the interests thencurrent fair market value based on managements current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2019  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from 7 million to 8 million  

e effective september 18 2023 the other member in hoboken has the right to require us to purchase all of its 10 ownership interest at the interests thencurrent fair market value based on managements current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2019  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from 9 million to 10 million  

f at december 31 2019  we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 43 million  

g in connection with our sale under the threat of condemnation of a portion of san antonio center we agreed to indemnify the condemning authority for costs including any payments required to be paid to tenants at the property in connection with the actual condemnation we expect the condemnation process to take several years and estimate these costs to be approximately 455 million  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2019  we have three real estate related equity method investments with total debt outstanding of 1111 million of which our share is 540 million our investment in these ventures at december 31 2019 was 234 million  

other than the items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2019 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2019  



 



  

our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility and senior notes additionally as of december 31 2019  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger loan default on our mortgage loans if we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2019  

  



 

 interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income loss which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and statement of shareholders equity cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition the default risk of the counterparty is evaluated by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

during 2019  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on a mortgage payable associated with our hoboken acquisition at 367  our assembly row hotel joint venture is also a party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the joint ventures mortgage debt at 5206  all swaps were designated and qualify as cash flow hedges hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted our earnings in 2019  2018 and 2017  

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

  

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization gains and losses on the sale of real estate and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows 



 



  






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2046 or with respect to finance lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2019  we had 34 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding including 565 million in mortgage payables that are effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2019 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 2505 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2019 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 2881 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2019 we had no variable rate debt outstanding

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

 employees 

at february 8 2019  we had 298 fulltime employees and 5 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including for our taxable years ending on or prior to december 31 2017  any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic legal andor competitive conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result we continue to see higher levels of anchor turnover and closings in some markets which has caused an oversupply of larger retail spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income as of december 31 2018  our anchor tenant space is 976 leased and 969 occupied 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 32 billion  of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately   4753 million  was secured by all or a portion of 13  of our real estate projects and approximately 715 million  represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties as of december 31 2018  915  of our debt is fixed rate which includes all of our property secured debt our unsecured senior notes and our capital lease obligations our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could

 our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants if we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

during 2018  construction continued on the development of phase ii at both assembly row and pike  rose with portions of both projects opening during 2018 additionally we commenced construction on phase iii at both projects and we continued our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row a further discussion of these projects expected costs and current status can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the outlook subsection 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations

our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90  of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 32 billion  of debt outstanding as of december 31 2018  approximately 2750 million  bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus 900 basis points we also have an 8000 million  revolving credit facility on which no  balance was outstanding at december 31 2018  that bears interest at libor plus 825 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders we may enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any such hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 



 10 

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no 

 11 

longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2018  we held 17 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a “downreit” structure additionally we have entered into joint venture agreements related to the hotel component of phase ii of our pike  rose and assembly row development projects we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2018  we held the controlling interests in all of our existing coinvestments except the hotel investments discussed above and the investment in the la alameda shopping center acquired in 2017 we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

 12 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 



 13 

in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

us federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect reits both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to anticipate 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” signed into law on december 22 2017 represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes while we currently do not expect the 2017 tax act will have a significant direct impact on us it may impact us indirectly as our tenants and the jurisdictions in which we do business as well as the overall investment thesis for reits may be impacted both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to predict additionally the overall impact of the 2017 tax act depends on future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by federal tax authorities as well as changes in state and local taxation in response to the 2017 tax act and it is possible that such future interpretations regulations and other changes could adversely impact us 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 



 14 

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to cyber attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cyber attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include password encryption frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace frequent backups a redundant data system for core applications and annual penetration testing however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack a cyber attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees tenants and vendors a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2018  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 104  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 241 million  square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida no  single commercial or residential property accounted for over 10 of our 2018  total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 3000  commercial leases and 2600  residential leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 27  of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2018  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 104  real estate projects are located in 12  states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2018  

  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three  to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at 

 16 

preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one  year or less and in 2018  represented approximately 85  of total rental income 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2018  for each of the 10 years beginning with 2019  and after 2028  in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2018  

  



during 2018  we signed leases for a total of 1972000  square feet of retail space including 1874000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 12  on a cash basis and 23  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 796000  square feet at an average rental increase of 25  on a cash basis and 38  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 1078000  square feet at an average rental increase of 4  on a cash basis and 13  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 2709  per square foot of which 6102  per square foot was for new leases and 202  per square foot was for renewals in 2018  

during 2017  we signed leases for a total of 1793000  square feet of retail space including 1622000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 13  on a cash basis and 26  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 773000  square feet at an average rental increase of 19  on a cash basis and 32  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 848000  square feet at an average rental increase of 9  on a cash basis and 21  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 3600  per square foot of which 6211  per square foot was for new leases and 1218  was for renewal leases in 2017  

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed for retail space in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure 

the leases signed in 2018  generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2021  and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 12 to 17 million square feet of retail space each year and expect the volume for 2019  will be in line with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however 

 17 

changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2018  except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in november 2016 we were included as a defendant in a class action lawsuit in the circuit court for montgomery county maryland related to predatory towing by a third party company we had retained to provide towing services at several of our properties in montgomery county maryland given the costs and risks of continuing litigation on this matter we elected to participate in a settlement for which our share was approximately 04 million  and was reimbursed by insurance the settlement did not cover liability for certain tows that were included in the lawsuit that the defendant class believes cannot be pursued because of the statute of limitations accordingly we do not believe we should have any additional liability for these remaining tows however if we are unsuccessful in dismissing these tows from the litigation our liability would be less than 01 million

on february 8 2019  there were 2492 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 51  consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2018  and 2017  were 402  per share and 394  per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2019  or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

  



distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 distributions on our 50 series c cumulative redeemable

preferred shares which were issued september 29 2017 were declared at the rate of 125 per depositary share per annum and the first payment date was january 16 2018 in 2018  dividends paid per depositary share were 1306  due to the timing of issuance we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of interest in our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2018  and 2017  our allowance for doubtful accounts was 127 million  and 118 million  respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 03 and 13 of rental income and it was 05 in 2018  a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 90 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2018  and 2017  accounts receivable includes approximately 974 million  and 931 million  respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

we completed construction on 221 condominium units at our assembly row and pike  rose properties beginning on january 1 2018 with the adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers see recent accounting pronouncements for discussion of change in timing of revenue recognition gains or losses on the sale of these condominium units are recognized as the condominium units are legally sold however in 2017 we accounted for contracted condominium sales under the percentageof completion method based on an evaluation of the criteria specified in asc topic 36020 “property plant and equipment – real estate sales” including the legal commitment of the purchaser in the real estate contract whether the construction of the project was beyond a preliminary phase whether sufficient units had been contracted to ensure the project would not revert to a rental project the ability to reasonably estimate the aggregate project sale proceeds and aggregate project costs and the determination that the buyer had made an adequate initial and continuing cash investment under the contract when the percentageofcompletion criteria had not been met no profit was recognized the application of these criteria can be complex and required us to make assumptions

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments and general economic and real estate factors certain events such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we calculate depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 274 million  and 8 million  respectively for 2018  and 410 million  and 8 million  respectively for 2017  we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 62 million  and 3 million  respectively for 2018  and 74 million  and 3 million  respectively for 2017  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 20 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2018  and 11 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2017  the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 7 million  3 million  and 6 million  for both 2018  and 2017  total capitalized costs were 373 million  and 512 million  for 2018  and 2017  respectively 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and 

 32 

include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis previous experience in our portfolio and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income 

recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

2018  property acquisitions and dispositions 

on june 15 2018  we formed a new joint venture to develop jordan downs plaza which when completed will be an approximately 113000  square foot grocery anchored shopping center located in los angeles county california we initially invested 344 million  as a result of a prefunding requirement for equity to be advanced prior to the start of construction we own approximately 91  of the venture and control the 94  acre land parcel on which the shopping center will be constructed under a longterm ground lease that expires june 15 2093  including two 10year option periods which may be exercised at our option the jordan downs plaza development is expected to generate income tax credits under the new market tax credit program nmtc which was provided for in the community renewal tax relief act of 2000 the act and is intended to induce investment in underserved areas of the united states the act permits taxpayers to claim credits against their federal income taxes for qualified investments a third party bank contributed 139 million  to the development and is entitled to the related tax credit benefits but they do not have an interest in the underlying economics of the property the transaction also includes a putcall provision whereby we may be obligated or entitled to purchase the third party bank’s interest we believe the put will be exercised at its 1000  strike price based on our assessment of control we concluded that the project and certain 

 33 

other transaction related entities should be consolidated the 139 million  in proceeds received in exchange for the transfer of the tax credits has been deferred and will be recognized when the tax benefits are delivered to the third party bank without risk of recapture direct and incremental costs of 16 million  incurred in structuring the nmtc transaction have also been deferred the trust anticipates recognizing the net cash received as revenue upon completion of the sevenyear nmtc compliance period cash in escrow at december 31 2018  of 322 million  reflects cash that will ultimately be used for the development of the shopping center and is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet the cash is held in escrow pursuant to the new market tax credit transaction documents and will be released as qualified development expenditures are incurred 

in august 2018  we contributed hotel related assets valued at 440 million  to our assembly row hotel joint venture and received a cash distribution of 380 million  at december 31 2018  our investment in the venture was 56 million  the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity controlled by our partner and as a result we are using the equity method to account for our investment 

on august 16 2018  we sold the residential building at our chelsea commons property in chelsea massachusetts for a sales price of 150 million  resulting in a gain of 31 million  

on november 9 2018  we sold our atlantic plaza property in north reading massachusetts for a sales price of 272 million  resulting in a gain of 16 million  

on november 29 2018  we acquired a 40000  square foot building adjacent to our bell gardens property for 96 million  

during the year ended december 31 2018  we closed on the sale of 176  condominium units at our assembly row and pike  rose properties combined and received proceeds net of closing costs of 1335 million  for the year ended december 31 2018  we recognized a gain of 72 million  net of 16 million  of income taxes the cost basis for remaining condominium units that are ready for their intended use as of december 31 2018  is 166 million  and is included in assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 

2018  and 2019 significant debt and equity transactions 

on march 1 2018  we repaid the 105 million  mortgage loan on the grove at shrewsbury west at par 

on august 10 2018 we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of our 2750 million unsecured term loan by one year to november 21 2019 

on may 7 2018 we replaced our existing atthemarket “atm” equity program with a new atm program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 4000 million  we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities fund our development and redevelopment pipeline repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility andor for general corporate purposes for the three months ended december 31 2018  we sold 374725  common shares at a weighted average price per share of 13136  for net cash proceeds of 487 million  and paid 05 million  in commissions and less than 01 million  in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares for the year  ended december 31 2018  we issued 987383  common shares at a weighted average price per share of 12919  for net cash proceeds of 1261 million  and paid 13 million  in commissions and 02 million  in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares as of december 31 2018  we had the capacity to issue up to 2724 million  in common shares under our atm equity program 

on january 31 2019  we repaid the 203 million  mortgage loan on rollingwood apartments at par prior to its original maturity date 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our comparable property growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals changes in portfolio occupancy and the redevelopment of those assets over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates we continue to see strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces however the time it takes to complete new lease deals is longer as tenants have become more selective and more deliberate in their decisionmaking 

 34 

process we have also experienced extended periods of time for some government agencies to process permits and inspections further delaying rent commencement on newly leased spaces additionally we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces and have seen an uptick in the number of retail tenants closing early andor filing for bankruptcy we believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment however any significant reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2018  no single tenant accounted for more than 27  of annualized base rent 

our properties are located primarily in densely populated andor affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected cost of approximately 210 million that we expect to stabilize in the next several years 

we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row and are under construction on an eight story 301000 square foot office building which will include an additional 18000 square feet of retail space and 1300 parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 205 and 215 million to be delivered in 2019 and the office portion is 100 preleased after current phases we have approximately 4 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 321000 square feet of commercial space additionally we control 12 acres of land across from santana row which has approximately 1 million square feet of commercial space entitlements 

construction continues on phase ii of assembly row which includes approximately 161000 square feet of retail space 447 residential units and a 158 room boutique hotel owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner total expected costs range from 290 million to 305 million and remaining delivery is expected in 2019 as of december 31 2018 approximately 120000 square feet of retail space and the 158 room hotel have opened and all of the residential units have been completed phase ii also includes 122 forsale condominium units of which 107 have closed as of december 31 2018 the remaining 15 units are expected to close in 2019 the condominium units have an expected total cost of 81 million additionally partners healthcare built a 741500 square foot office building as part of phase ii 

additionally we commenced construction on phase iii of assembly row which will include 277000 square feet of office space of which 150000 square feet is preleased 56000 square feet of retail space 500 residential units and over 800 additional parking spaces the expected costs for phase iii are between 465 million and 485 million and is projected to open beginning in 2022 

construction also continues on phase ii of pike  rose which includes approximately 216000 square feet of retail space 272 residential units and a 177 room boutique hotel owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner as of december 31 2018 approximately 190000 square feet of retail space and the 177 room hotel have opened and all of the residential units have been completed total expected costs range from 200 million to 207 million and remaining delivery is expected in 2019 as of december 31 2018 we closed on the sale of 69 of the 99 forsale condominium units in phase ii the condominiums have an expected total cost of 62 million 

additionally at pike  rose we commenced construction on a 212000 square foot office building which includes 4000 square feet of ground floor retail space and will include over 600 additional parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 128 million and 135 million and is projected to open beginning in 2021 

we invested 82 million in assembly row and pike  rose in 2018  and expect to invest between 175 million and 200 million in assembly row and pike  rose in 2019  

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt we may also finance our 

 35 

acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through assumed mortgages and property sales 

at december 31 2018  the leasable square feet in our properties was 946  leased and 936  occupied the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies 

comparable properties 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “comparable property” basis information provided on a comparable property basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties that are currently under development or are being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment for the year ended december 31 2018  and the comparison of 2018  and 2017  all or a portion of 90 properties were considered comparable properties and eight properties were considered noncomparable properties for the year ended december 31 2018  five properties were moved from acquisitions to comparable properties one portion of a property was removed from comparable properties as it was sold during 2018 one portion of a property was moved from comparable properties to noncomparable properties and one portion of a property was moved from noncomparable properties to comparable properties compared to the designations as of december 31 2017  for the year ended december 31 2017  and the comparison of 2017  and 2016  all or a portion of 85 properties were considered comparable properties and 7 properties were considered noncomparable properties for the year ended december 31 2017  one property was moved from acquisitions to comparable properties and two properties were removed from comparable properties as they were sold during 2017 compared to the designations as of december 31 2016  while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move noncomparable properties to comparable properties once they have stabilized which is typically considered 90 physical occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from comparable properties when the repositioning of the asset has commenced and has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to comparable properties once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under development or being repositioned for significant redevelopment and investment comparable property information replaces our previous same center designations

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

at december 31 2018  we had cash and cash equivalents of 641 million  and no  outstanding balance on our 8000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility which matures on april 20 2020  subject to two sixmonth extensions at our option in addition we have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 15 billion for the year ended 2018  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 1770 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 831 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 27  during 2019 we have only 2953 million of debt maturing of which 203 million was repaid on january 31 2019 as of december 31 2018  we had the capacity to issue up to 2724 million  in common shares under our atm equity program we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm program our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2019  will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and future phases of santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment compared to 2018 as we invest in the next phase of these projects with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years our capital investments will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor our revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements

summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 579 million  to 5167 million  during 2018  from 4588 million  during 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before certain noncash items 124 million in net proceeds from the jordan downs plaza new market tax credit transaction see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion and timing of cash receipts partially offset by timing of interest payments on our senior notes 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 6457 million  to 1922 million  during 2018  from 8379 million  during 2017  the decrease was primarily attributable to 

 net cash used in financing activities increased 6108 million  to 2413 million  during 2018  from 3694 million  provided by financing activities during 2017  the increase was primarily attributable to

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement a minority partner has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its 2663  interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value if the other minority partner defaults in their obligation we must purchase the full interest based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2018  our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 78 million  to 83 million  

b under the terms of various other partnership agreements the partners have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2018  a total of 738423  operating partnership units are outstanding

d two  of the members in plaza el segundo have the right to require us to purchase their 100  and 118  ownership interests at the interests thencurrent fair market value if the members fail to exercise their put options we have the right to purchase each of their interests on or after december 30 2026 at fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2018  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 23 million  to 26 million  

e effective january 1 2017  the other member in the grove at shrewsbury and brook 35 has the right to require us to purchase all of its approximately 48  interest in the grove at shrewsbury and approximately 88  interest in brook 35 at the interests thencurrent fair market value based on managements current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2018  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from 9 million  to 10 million  on january 4 2019  we acquired a portion of the noncontrolling interest in brook 35 for 08 million  bringing the noncontrolling ownership interest down to 65  

 f at december 31 2018  we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 13 million  

 45 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2018  we have three real estate related equity method investments with total debt outstanding of 1126 million of which our share is 541 million our investment in these ventures at december 31 2018  was 269 million  

other than the items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2018  that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

 46 

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2018  



 

 our revolving credit facility term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility term loan and senior notes additionally as of december 31 2018  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger loan default on our mortgage loans if we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders 

 47 

could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2018  

  



 

 interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income loss which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the balance sheet and statement of shareholders equity cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition the default risk of the counterparty is evaluated by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

prior to november 1 2018 we were party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 262  both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value as of december 31 2018  our assembly row hotel joint venture is a party to two interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix their debt at 5206 both swaps were designated and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in 2018  2017  and 2016  

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

 48 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90  of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2046 or with respect to capital lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2018  we had 29 billion  of fixedrate debt outstanding we also had capital lease obligations of 715 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2018  had been 10  higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 2038 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2018  had been 10  lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 2342 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2018  we had 2750 million  of variable rate debt outstanding based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 28 million with a corresponding decrease in our net income and cash flows for the year conversely if market rates decreased 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 28 million with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic andor competitive conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants while demand for our retail spaces has been sufficient to increase occupancy there can be no assurance that this will continue any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result we have been experiencing higher levels of anchor vacancy and expect this will persist over the next few years while we are actively releasing vacant space and in some cases redeveloping the shopping center as of december 31 2017 our anchor tenant space is 981 leased and 965 occupied we also have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 33 billion  of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 4916 million  was secured by all or a portion of 13  of our real estate projects and approximately 716 million  represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties as of december 31 2017  988  of our debt is fixed rate which includes all of our property secured debt our unsecured senior notes our capital lease obligations and our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of 

 7 

debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all of our default related financial covenants if we were to breach any of our default related debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

 8 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own such as assembly row in somerville massachusetts and pike  rose in north bethesda maryland we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

during 2017  construction continued on the development of phase ii at both assembly row and pike  rose with portions of both projects opening during 2017 at santana row we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts including construction of an eight story 284000 square foot office building which will include an additional 29000 square feet of retail space and 1300 parking spaces a further discussion of these projects expected costs and current status can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the outlook subsection 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 



 9 

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90  of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 33 billion  of debt outstanding as of december 31 2017  approximately 3160 million  bears interest at variable rates of which 2750 million  is effectively fixed at 262  through two  interest rate swap agreements we have an 8000 million  revolving credit facility on which 410 million  is outstanding at december 31 2017  that bears interest at libor plus 825 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders we may enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

 10 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

 11 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2017  we held 16 predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a “downreit” structure additionally we have entered into joint venture agreements related to the hotel component of phase ii of our pike  rose and assembly row development projects we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2017  we held the controlling interests in all of our existing coinvestments except the hotel investments discussed above and the investment in the la alameda shopping center acquired in 2017 we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy 

 12 

environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 



 13 

we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

us federal tax reform legislation now and in the future could affect reits both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to anticipate 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the “2017 tax act” signed into law on december 22 2017 represents sweeping tax reform legislation that makes significant changes to corporate and individual tax rates and the calculation of taxes while we currently do not expect the 2017 tax act will have a significant direct impact on us it may impact us indirectly as our tenants and the jurisdictions in which we do business as well as the overall investment thesis for reits may be impacted both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to predict additionally the overall impact of the 2017 tax act depends on future interpretations and regulations that may be issued by federal tax authorities as well as changes in state and local taxation in response to the 2017 tax act and it is possible that such future interpretations regulations and other changes could adversely impact us 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would 

 14 

not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance 

 15 

is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include password encryption frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace frequent backups a redundant data system for core applications and annual penetration testing however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees tenants and vendors a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2017  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 104  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 242 million  square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida no  single property accounted for over 10 of our 2017  total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 3000  leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 29  of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2017  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

 16 

geographic diversification 

our 104  real estate projects are located in 12  states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2017  

  



  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three  to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one  year or less and in 2017  represented approximately 69  of total rental income 

 17 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2017  for each of the 10 years beginning with 2018  and after 2027  in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2017  

  



during 2017  we signed leases for a total of 1793000  square feet of retail space including 1622000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 13  on a cash basis and 26  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 773000  square feet at an average rental increase of 19  on a cash basis and 32  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 848000  square feet at an average rental increase of 9  on a cash basis and 21  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 3600 per square foot of which 6211  per square foot was for new leases and 1218  per square foot was for renewals in 2017  

during 2016  we signed leases for a total of 1688000  square feet of retail space including 1473000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 13  on a cash basis and 26  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 543000  square feet at an average rental increase of 24  on a cash basis and 40  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 930000  square feet at an average rental increase of 7  on a cash basis and 17  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 3100 per square foot of which 6647  per square foot was for new leases and 1028  was for renewal leases in 2016  

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure 

the leases signed in 2017  generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2020  and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 12 to 16 million square feet of retail space each year and expect the volume for 2018  will be in line with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in november 2016 we were included as a defendant in a class action lawsuit in the circuit court for montgomery county maryland related to predatory towing by a third party company we had retained to provide towing services at several of our properties in montgomery county maryland we individually and collectively with other members of the more than 500  property owner defendant class have undertaken numerous legal actions to challenge property owner liability in this case including challenging the certification of the class as a matter of law however all of these legal actions have been unsuccessful given the costs and risks of continuing litigation on this matter we elected to participate in a settlement for which our share is approximately 04 million  we expect that this settlement amount will be reimbursed by insurance the 

 24 

settlement did not cover liability for certain tows that were included in the lawsuit that the defendant class believes cannot be pursued because of the statute of limitations accordingly we do not believe we should have any additional liability for these remaining tows however if we are unsuccessful in dismissing these tows from the litigation our liability would be approximately 02 million  assuming payment on the same terms as the settlement

on february 8 2018  there were 2568 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 50  consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2017  and 2016  were 394  per share and 380  per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2018  or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

  



distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 distributions on our 50 series c cumulative redeemable preferred shares which were issued september 29 2017 were declared at the rate of 125 per depository share per annum

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed “forwardlooking statements” see “item 1a risk factors” in this report for important information regarding these forwardlooking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust “reit” specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida as of december 31 2017  we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 104  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 242 million  square feet in total the real estate projects were 953  leased and 939  occupied at december 31 2017  we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 50  consecutive years 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

 30 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2017  and 2016  our allowance for doubtful accounts was 118 million  and 119 million  respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 03 and 13 of rental income and it was 03 in 2017  a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 84 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2017  and 2016  accounts receivable includes approximately 931 million  and 806 million  respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

we are currently under construction on 221 condominium units at our assembly row and pike  rose properties gains or losses on the sale of these condominium units are recognized in accordance with the provisions of asc topic 36020 “property plant and equipment – real estate sales” we account for contracted condominium sales under the percentageof completion method based on an evaluation of the criteria specified in asc topic 36020 including the legal commitment of the purchaser in the real estate contract whether the construction of the project is beyond a preliminary phase whether sufficient units have been contracted to ensure the project will not revert to a rental project the ability to reasonably estimate the aggregate project sale proceeds and aggregate project costs and the determination that the buyer has made an adequate initial and continuing cash investment under the contract when the percentageofcompletion criteria have not been met no profit is recognized the application of these criteria can be complex and requires us to make assumptions the timing of revenue recognition related to these condominium sales will be impacted by the january 1 2018 adoption of asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers see recent accounting pronouncements in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the changes

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments and general economic and real estate factors certain events such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we calculate depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 410 million  and 8 million  respectively for 2017  and 420 million  and 9 million  respectively for 2016  we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 74 million  and 3 million  respectively for 2017  and 61 million  and 3 million  respectively for 2016  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 11 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2017  and 13 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2016  the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 7 million  3 million  and 6 million  for 2017  and 8 million  2 million  and 6 million  for 2016  total capitalized costs were 512 million  and 511 million  for 2017  and 2016  respectively 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and 

 32 

include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis previous experience in our portfolio and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals changes in portfolio occupancy and the redevelopment of those assets over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and generally increase rental rates we continue to see strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces however the time it takes to complete new lease deals is longer as tenants have become more selective and more deliberate in their decisionmaking process we have also experienced extended periods of time for some government agencies to process permits and inspections further delaying rent commencement on newly leased spaces additionally we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces and have seen an uptick in the number of retail tenants closing early andor filing for bankruptcy we believe the locations and nature of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any potential negative changes in the economic environment however any significant reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2017  no single tenant accounted for more than 29  of annualized base rent 

our properties are located primarily in densely populated andor affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion

reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected cost of approximately 155 million that we expect to stabilize in the next several years 

we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row and are under construction on an eight story 284000 square foot office building which will include an additional 29000 square feet of retail space and 1300 parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 205 and 215 million and to be delivered in 2019 after current phases we have approximately 4 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 321000 square feet of commercial space additionally we control 12 acres of land adjacent to santana row 

we continue to invest in our longterm multiphased mixeduse development projects at assembly row in somerville massachusetts and pike  rose in north bethesda maryland which we expect to be involved in over the coming years 

construction of phase ii of assembly row which will include 161000 square feet of retail space 447 residential units and a 158 room boutique hotel which will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner is underway total expected costs range from 280 million to 295 million and remaining delivery is expected in 2018 approximately 49000 square feet of retail space in phase ii has opened in 2017 and in september the first tenants moved into the new residential building phase ii will also include 122 forsale condominium units with an expected total cost of 74 million to 79 million additionally as part of the second phase we entered into a ground lease agreement with partners healthcare to bring 741500 square feet of office space to assembly row the ground lease agreement included a purchase option which was exercised and the related sale closed on april 4 2017 

construction of phase ii of pike  rose is also underway phase ii will include approximately 216000 square feet of retail space 272 residential units and a 177 room boutique hotel approximately 151000 square feet of retail space in phase ii has opened in 2017 and in august the first tenants moved into the new residential building total expected costs range from 200 million to 207 million and remaining delivery is expected in 2018 the hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner phase ii will also include 99 forsale condominium units with an expected cost of 53 million to 58 million 

we invested 273 million in assembly row and pike  rose in 2017  and expect to invest between 75 million and 100 million in assembly row and pike  rose in 2018  

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through assumed mortgages 

at december 31 2017  the leasable square feet in our properties was 953  leased and 939  occupied the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant closings and bankruptcies

samecenter 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared for the year ended december 31 2017  and the comparison of 2017  and 2016  all or a portion of 78 properties were considered samecenter and 15 properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2017  one property was moved from acquisition to samecenter two properties were removed from samecenter as they were sold during 2017 and four properties or portions of properties were moved from redevelopment to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2016  for the year ended december 31 2016  and the comparison of 2016  and 2015  all or a portion of 76 properties were considered samecenter and 17 properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2016  three properties or portions of properties were moved from samecenter to redevelopment and one property was moved from redevelopment to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2015  while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move redevelopment properties to samecenter once they have stabilized which is typically considered 95 occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from same center when the redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to samecenter once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion

gain on sale of real estate 

the 325 million  gain on sale of real estate and change in control of interests is primarily the result of our obtaining control of six properties when we acquired clarion’s 70 interest in the partnership that owned those properties see discussion in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the properties were previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting we consolidated these assets effective january 13 2016 and consequently recognized a gain of 257 million upon obtaining the controlling interest 2016 also included a 18 million gain related to the may 2016 sale of a building in coconut grove florida by an unconsolidated joint venture our share of the gain net of noncontrolling interests was 05 million and a 49 million gain due to the reversal of the warranty reserve for condominium units at santana row as the statutorily mandated latent construction defect period ended in third quarter 2016 and no further claims were filed 

the 283 million  gain on sale of real estate for 2015 is due to the sale of our houston street property in april 2015 and the sale of our courtyard shops property in november 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

 43 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

at december 31 2017  we had cash and cash equivalents of 152 million  and 410 million  outstanding on our 8000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility which matures on april 20 2020  subject to two sixmonth extensions at our option in addition we have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 15 billion our 2750 million  unsecured term loan that matures on november 21 2018  subject to a oneyear extension at our option also has an option subject to bank approval to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to 3500 million as of december 31 2017  we had the capacity to issue up to 2613 million  in common shares under our atm equity program 

for 2017  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 3440 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 1475 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 19  during 2017  we raised 7169 million of net proceeds through three separate public offerings for a total of 5750 million of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average coupon of 347 and term of 13 years and 1500 million of 50 preferred shares in addition to 1083 million  raised under our atm equity program during 2018 we have only 105 million of debt maturing in addition to our unsecured term loan mentioned above we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm equity program our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2018  will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and future phases of santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to see a reduced level of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment compared to 2017 which is the result of completing construction on phase ii at both assembly row and pike  rose in 2018 with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years our capital investments will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor our revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 355 million  to 4592 million  during 2017  from 4237 million  during 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before certain noncash items and the timing of payments related to operating costs

contractual commitments 

the following table provides a summary of our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2017  

  



  

 in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed the following potential commitments exist 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement a minority partner has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its 2663  interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value if the other minority partner defaults in their obligation we must purchase the full interest based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2017  our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 81 million  to 85 million  

b under the terms of various other partnership agreements the partners have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2017  a total of 787962  operating partnership units are outstanding 

c the other member in montrose crossing has the right to require us to purchase all of its 101  interest in montrose crossing at the interests thencurrent fair market value if the other member fails to exercise its put option we have the right to purchase its interest on or after december 27 2021 at fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2017  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 12 million  to 13 million  

d two  of the members in plaza el segundo have the right to require us to purchase their 100  and 118  ownership interests at the interests thencurrent fair market value if the members fail to exercise their put options we have the right to purchase each of their interests on or after december 30 2026 at fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2017  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 26 million  to 29 million  

e effective january 1 2017  the other member in the grove at shrewsbury and brook 35 has the right to require us to purchase all of its approximately 48  interest in the grove at shrewsbury and approximately 88  interest in brook 35 at the interests thencurrent fair market value based on managements current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2017  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from 9 million  to 10 million  

f at december 31 2017  we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 13 million  

 46 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than the items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2017  that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

 47 

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2017  



 



 48 

our revolving credit facility term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants related to our revolving credit facility term loan and senior notes additionally as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants that could trigger loan default on our mortgage loans if we were to breach any of these financial and other covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2017  

  



 

 interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income loss which is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of shareholders equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

as of december 31 2017  we are party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 262  both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in 2017  2016  and 2015  and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

 49 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90  of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows 



  

 



 50 

operating partnership units that were excluded from the computation of diluted eps conversion of these operating partnership units is dilutive in the computation of ffo per diluted common share but is antidilutive for the computation of diluted eps for the periods presented 






 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2017  we were party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the rate on the 2750 million  term loan at 262  

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2046 or with respect to capital lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2017  we had 32 billion  of fixedrate debt outstanding including our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements we also had capital lease obligations of 716 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2017  had been 10  higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 2394 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2017  had been 10  lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 2764 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2017  we had 410 million  of variable rate debt outstanding based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10 our annual interest expense woud increase by approximately 04 million with a corresponding decrease in our net income and cash flows for the year conversely if market rates decreased 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 04 million with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

 employees 

at february 8 2017  we had 312 fulltime employees and 17 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic andor competitive conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants while demand for our retail spaces has been strong there can be no assurance that this will continue any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result we currently are experiencing higher levels of anchor vacancy and expect this will persist over the next few years while we are actively releasing vacant space and in some cases redeveloping the shopping center our anchor tenant space is currently 971 leased and 963 occupied we also have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 28 billion  of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 4663 million  was secured by all or a portion of nine  of our real estate projects and approximately 716 million  represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties all of our debt outstanding as of december 31 2016  is fixed rate debt which includes all of our property secured debt our capital lease obligations and our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may 

 7 

incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

adverse changes in our credit rating could affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our credit worthiness is rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings assigned are based on our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios financial condition and prospects and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to our industry and the economic outlook in general our credit rating can affect the amount of capital we access as well as the terms of certain existing and future financing we obtain since we depend on debt financing to fund the growth of our business an adverse change in our credit rating including actual changes in outlook or even the initiation of review of our credit rating that could result in an adverse change could have a material adverse effect on us 

 8 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own such as assembly row in somerville massachusetts and pike  rose in north bethesda maryland we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

during 2016  construction continued on the development of phase ii at both assembly row and pike  rose at santana row we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts completed construction of a new 234500 square foot office building that is preleased to splunk inc and are also proceeding with construction of an eight story 284000 square foot office building which will include 29000 square feet of retail space and 1300 parking spaces a further discussion of these projects expected costs and current status can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the outlook subsection 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 



 9 

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90  of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 28 billion  of debt outstanding as of december 31 2016  approximately 2750 million  bears interest at variable rates which is effectively fixed at 262  through two  interest rate swap agreements we have an 8000 million  revolving credit facility on which no  balance is outstanding at december 31 2016  that bears interest at libor plus 825 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders we may enter into this type of hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and 

 10 

capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

 11 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2016  we held nine predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to properties owned in a “downreit” structure additionally we have entered into a joint venture agreement related to the hotel component of phase ii of our pike  rose and assembly row development projects we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2016  we held the controlling interests in all of our existing coinvestments except the hotel investments discussed above we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be 

 12 

forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 



 13 

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 



 14 

in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include password encryption frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace frequent backups a redundant data system for core applications and annual penetration testing however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees tenants and vendors a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda and recently issued standards that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2016  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 96  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 226 million  square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2016  total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 2900  leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 31  of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2016  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 96  real estate projects are located in 12  states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2016  

  



  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

 16 

commercial property leases generally range from three  to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one  year or less and in 2016  represented approximately 66  of total rental income 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2016  for each of the 10 years beginning with 2017  and after 2026  in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2016  

  



lease rollovers 

for 2016  we signed leases for a total of 1688000  square feet of retail space including 1473000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 13  on a cash basis and 26  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 543000  square feet at an average rental increase of 24  on a cash basis and 40  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 930000  square feet at an average rental increase of 7  on a cash basis and 17  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 6647  per square foot for new leases and 1028  per square foot for renewals in 2016  

for 2015  we signed leases for a total of 1593000  square feet of retail space including 1405000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 17  on a cash basis and 29  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 547000  square feet at an average rental increase of 22  on a cash basis and 35  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 859000  square feet at an average rental increase of 14  on a cash basis and 24  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 6098  per square foot for new leases and 879  for renewal leases in 2015  

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure 

the leases signed in 2016  generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2019  and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

 17 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 12 to 15 million square feet of retail space each year and expect the volume for 2017  will be in line with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2016  except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in november 2016 we were included as a defendant in a class action lawsuit related to predatory towing by a third party company we had retained to provide towing services at several of our properties in montgomery county maryland we were not named as a defendant in the litigation prior to the certification of the defendant class in december 2015 the towing company defendant reached a settlement with the plaintiff class that resulted in a 22 million judgment being entered against them after the judgment was entered the circuit court for montgomery county maryland certified a defendant class of approximately 600 property owners including us we believe this is the first time a maryland court has certified a defendant class that has resulted in a complete denial of due process to the members of that class and together with the others filed a writ of mandamus challenging the certification of the defendant class the hearing of the writ by the court of appeals is discretionary because of the specific facts and circumstances of our contractual relationship with the towing company we do 

 24 

not believe we should have been included in the defendant class nor do we believe we should have any liability in this matter we are currently pursuing all available legal remedies and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in the matter including defenses based on the total lack of due process afforded to us to present our unique facts and circumstances we believe our potential loss in this matter ranges from 0 to an undetermined share of the 22 million judgment the judgment does not provide any guidance for how the judgment amount is to be shared amongst the defendant class

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 49  consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2016  and 2015  were 380  per share and 355  per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2017  or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed “forwardlooking statements” see “item 1a risk factors” in this report for important information regarding these forwardlooking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

 30 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust “reit” specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states california and south florida as of december 31 2016  we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 96  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 226 million  square feet in total the real estate projects were 944  leased and 933  occupied at december 31 2016  we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 49  consecutive years 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2016  and 2015  our allowance for doubtful accounts was 119 million  and 117 million  respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 03 and 13 of rental income and it was 03 in 2016  a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 79 million 

 31 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2016  and 2015  accounts receivable includes approximately 806 million  and 727 million  respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments and general economic and real estate factors certain events such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we calculate depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 420 million  and 9 million  respectively for 2016  and 232 million  and 8 million  respectively for 2015  we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 61 million  and 3 million  respectively for 2016  and 42 million  and 2 million  respectively for 2015  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 13 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2016  and 17 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2015  the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 8 million  2 million  and 6 million  for 2016  and 7 million  1 million  and 6 million  for 2015  total capitalized costs were 511 million  and 307 million  for 2016  and 2015  respectively 

 32 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

 33 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis previous experience in our portfolio and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates we continued to see strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces however the time it takes to complete new lease deals is longer as tenants have become more selective and more deliberate in their decisionmaking process we have also experienced extended periods of time for some government agencies to process permits and inspections further delaying rent commencement on newly leased spaces additionally we have seen an overall decrease in number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any negative changes in the economic environment however any significant reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2016  no single tenant accounted for more than 31  of annualized base rent 

our properties are located primarily in densely populated andor affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities we currently have redevelopment projects underway with a projected cost of approximately 188 million that we expect to stabilize in the next several years 

we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row in 2016 we completed and opened our 113 million six story building with 234500 square feet of office space and 670 parking spaces that was preleased to splunk inc we are also proceeding with an eight story 284000 square foot office building which will include 29000 square feet of retail space and 1300 parking spaces the building is expected to cost between 205 and 215 million and to deliver in 2019 after current phases we have approximately 4 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 321000 square feet of commercial space additionally we control 12 acres of land adjacent to santana row 

we continue to invest in the development at assembly row which is a longterm multiphased mixeduse development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years the carrying value of the development portion of this project at december 31 2016  is approximately 541 million  the project currently has zoning entitlements to build 34 million  square feet of commercialuse buildings 1840  residential units and a 170  room hotel the first phase consists of approximately 331000 square feet of retail space and 98000 square feet of office space both owned by the trust and 445 residential units owned by avalonbay communities avalonbay communities has exercised their purchase option for the land related to the residential buildings which is expected to close in 2017 the massachusetts bay transit authority mbta constructed the new orange line tstop at the property which opened in september 2014 the retail and office space in phase i are fully delivered and are 100 leased total costs for phase i of assembly row are 196 million 

we are also proceeding with development of phase ii of assembly row which will include 161000 square feet of retail space a 159 room boutique hotel and 447 residential units the hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner total expected costs range from 270 million to 285 million and delivery is expected in 20172018 phase ii will also include 122 forsale condominium units with an expected total cost of 70 million to 75 million additionally as part of the second phase we entered into a ground lease agreement with partners healthcare to bring 741500 square feet of office space to assembly row the ground lease agreement includes a purchase option which was exercised and is expected to close in 2017 partners healthcare commenced construction on this new building in september 2014 and during the second quarter of 2016 started relocating its employees to assembly row 

 35 

we invested 153 million in assembly row in 2016  and expect to invest between 140 million and 165 million in assembly row in 2017  net of public funding 

our pike  rose project in north bethesda md a longterm multiphased mixeduse development project currently has zoning entitlements to build 16 million square feet of commercialuse buildings and 1605 residential units phase i of pike  rose includes 493 residential units 159000 square feet of retail space and 80000 square feet of office space phase i reached stabilized physical occupancy in the fourth quarter of 2016 total costs for phase i of pike  rose range from 265 million to 270 million 

additionally we are proceeding with development of phase ii of pike  rose phase ii will include approximately 216000 square feet of retail space a 177 room selectservice hotel and 272 residential units total expected costs range from 200 million to 207 million and delivery is expected in 20172018 the hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we are a partner phase ii will also include 99 forsale condominium units with an expected cost of 53 million to 58 million 

we invested 100 million in pike  rose in 2016  and expect to invest between 105 million and 130 million in pike  rose in 2017  

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through new or assumed mortgages 

at december 31 2016  the leasable square feet in our properties was 933  occupied and 944  leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

samecenter 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared for the year ended december 31 2016  and the comparison of 2016  and 2015  all or a portion of 76 properties were considered samecenter and 17 properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2016  three properties or portions of properties were moved from samecenter to redevelopment and one property was moved from redevelopment to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2015  for the year ended december 31 2015  and the comparison of 2015  and 2014  all or a portion of 77 properties were considered samecenter and 14 properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2015  three properties were moved from acquisition to samecenter three properties were moved from samecenter to redevelopment two properties were removed from samecenter as they were sold during 2015 and one property was moved from redevelopment to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2014  while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move redevelopment properties to samecenter once they have stabilized which is typically considered 95 occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from same center when the redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to samecenter once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

at december 31 2016  we had 234 million  of cash and cash equivalents and no  outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility on april 20 2016 we upsized our 6000 million revolving credit facility to 8000 million  and extended the maturity date to april 20 2020  subject to two sixmonth extensions at our option in addition we have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 15 billion our 2750 million  unsecured term loan that matures on november 21 2018  subject to a oneyear extension at our option also has an option subject to bank approval to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to 3500 million as of december 31 2016  we had the capacity to issue up to 3709 million  in common shares under our atm equity program

for 2016  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 2515 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 773 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 13  on march 7 2016  we issued 10 million  common shares at 14943  per share in an underwritten public offering for net cash proceeds of 1493 million  on july 12 2016  we issued 2500 million  of fixed rate senior unsecured notes that mature on august 1 2046   and bear interest at   3625  the notes were offered at   97756   of the principal amount with a yield to maturity of   375  the net proceeds from this note offering after issuance discounts underwriting fees and other costs were   2418 million  during 2017 we have 2167 million of debt maturing we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm equity program our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2017  will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and future phases of santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment which is the result of construction on phase ii at both assembly row and pike  rose construction of our next phase of santana row and our redevelopment pipeline with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years our capital investments will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor our revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 594 million  to 4193 million  during 2016  from 3598 million  during 2015  the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before certain noncash items timing of payments from tenants and the timing of interest payments and other operating costs

offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than the items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2016  that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2016  



 

 our revolving credit facility term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2016  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take

possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2016  

  



 

 interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive loss income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of shareholders equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

as of december 31 2016  we are party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 262  both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in 2016  2015  and 2014  and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90  of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2016  we were party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the rate on the 2750 million  term loan at 262  

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2046 or with respect to capital lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2016  we had 27 billion  of fixedrate debt outstanding including our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements we also had capital lease obligations of 716 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2016  had been 10  higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 1769 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2016  had been 10  lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 2053 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2016  we had no  variable rate debt outstanding

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and executive vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america this process includes policies and procedures that 

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework  in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial

reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report and provides reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

 investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion acquisition and development opportunities we consider such factors as

 employees 

at february 5 2016  we had 299 fulltime employees and 137 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or 

 5 

changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic andor competitive conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants while demand for our retail spaces has been strong there can be no assurance that this will continue any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result while our anchor tenant space is currently 961 occupied we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 26 billion  of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 4828 million  was secured by all or a portion of nine  of our real estate projects and approximately 716 million  represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties in addition we owned a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 344 million  of debt secured by two properties as of december 31 2015  on january 13 2016  we acquired our partners 70 interest in the joint venture and assumed 100 of the related debt approximately 26 billion   976  of our debt as of december 31 2015  is fixed rate debt which includes all of our property secured debt our capital lease obligations and our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements our joint venture’s debt of 344 

 7 

million  which is unconsolidated as of december 31 2015  is also fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 our ability to make scheduled principal payments of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own such as assembly row in somerville massachusetts and pike  rose in north bethesda maryland we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

during 2015  construction commenced on the development of phase ii at both assembly row and pike  rose at santana row we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts and are constructing a new 234500 square foot office building which has been fully leased to one tenant a further discussion of these projects expected costs and current status can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the outlook subsection 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90  of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to 

 9 

debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 26 billion  of debt outstanding as of december 31 2015  approximately 3379 million  bears interest at variable rates of which 2750 million  is effectively fixed through two  interest rate swap agreements we have a 6000 million  revolving credit facility on which 535 million  is outstanding at december 31 2015  that bears interest at libor plus 90 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders the interest rate on our 2750 million  term loan is currently fixed at 262  as a result of two  interest rate swap agreements we may enter into this type of hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

  10 

competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues 

each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result 

 11 

in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2015  we held nine predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by clarion partners “clarion” and properties owned in a “downreit” structure additionally we have entered into a joint venture agreement related to the hotel component of phase ii of our pike  rose development project we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2015  we held the controlling interests in all of our existing coinvestments except the clarion and hotel investments discussed above we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

on january 13 2016  we acquired our partners 70 interest in our clarion joint venture and subsequently own 100 of the related properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

 12 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

  13 

in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the 

 14 

votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include password encryption frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace frequent backups a redundant data system for core applications and annual penetration testing however there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing a cyber attack a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees tenants and vendors a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2015  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 90  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 214 million  square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as california and south florida no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2015  total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2015  we had approximately 2700  leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 29  of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2015  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 90  real estate projects are located in 12  states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2015  

  



  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three  to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one  year or less and in 2015  represented approximately 61  of total rental income 

 16 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2015  for each of the 10 years beginning with 2016  and after 2025  in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2015  

  



lease rollovers 

for 2015  we signed leases for a total of 1593000  square feet of retail space including 1405000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 17  on a cash basis and 29  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 547000  square feet at an average rental increase of 22  on a cash basis and 35  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 859000  square feet at an average rental increase of 14  on a cash basis and 24  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 6098 per square foot for new leases and 879 per square foot for renewals in 2015  

for 2014  we signed leases for a total of 1765000  square feet of retail space including 1545000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 16  on a cash basis and 29  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 704000  square feet at an average rental increase of 25  on a cash basis and 38  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 840000  square feet at an average rental increase of 11  on a cash basis and 23  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 4446 per square foot for new leases and 127 for renewal leases in 2014  

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure 

the leases signed in 2015  generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2018  and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 12 to 15 million square feet of retail space each year and expect the volume for 2016  will be in line with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2015  except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

on february 5 2016  there were 2840 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 48  consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2015  and 2014  were 355  per share and 321  per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2016  or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

  



distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2015  and 2014  our allowance for doubtful accounts was 117 million  and 124 million  respectively 

 30 

historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 03 and 13 of rental income and it was 02 in 2015  reflecting positive economic changes and their impact to our tenants a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 73 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2015  and 2014  accounts receivable includes approximately 727 million  and 661 million  respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments and general economic and real estate factors certain events such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 232 million  and 8 million  respectively for 2015  and 277 million  and 7 million  respectively for 2014  we capitalized external 

 31 

and internal costs related to other property improvements of 42 million  and 2 million  respectively for 2015  and 45 million  and 2 million  respectively for 2014  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 17 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2015  and 29 million  and 7 million  respectively for 2014  the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 7 million  1 million  and 6 million  for both 2015  and 2014  total capitalized costs were 307 million  and 367 million  for 2015  and 2014  respectively 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

 32 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis previous experience in our portfolio and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates we have generally continued to see an encouraging operating environment for many of our tenants as well as strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces while there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any negative changes in the economic environment however any significant reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and 

 34 

results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2015  no single tenant accounted for more than 29  of annualized base rent 

our properties are located primarily in densely populated andor affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities in 2016  we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately 154 million 

we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row and are currently proceeding with our next phase of redevelopment which is a six story building with 234500 square feet of office space and 670 parking spaces during the third quarter 2015 we executed a lease with splunk inc for the entire building the building is expected to cost between 110 and 115 million and stabilize in 2017 after current phases we have approximately 9 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 395 residential units and 634000 square feet of commercial space additionally we control an additional 12 acres of land adjacent to santana row 

we continue to invest in the development at assembly row which is a longterm multiphased mixeduse development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years the carrying value of the development portion of this project at december 31 2015  is approximately 395 million  the project currently has zoning entitlements to build 34 million  square feet of commercialuse buildings 1843  residential units and a 170  room hotel the first phase consists of approximately 331000 square feet of retail space and 98000 square feet of office space both owned by the trust and 445 residential units owned by avalonbay communities the massachusetts bay transit authority mbta constructed the new orange line tstop at the property which opened in september 2014 minimal amounts of construction remain to be completed on the first phase the retail space in phase i opened during 2014 and currently is 100 leased additionally as of december 31 2015  74000 square feet of office space is open and we expect the remainder to open through the first half of 2016 phase i is expected to stabilize in 2016 total expected costs for phase i of assembly row net of reimbursements expected range from 194 million to 196 million of which 193 million has been incurred to date 

we are also proceeding with development of phase ii of assembly row which will include 167000 square feet of retail space a 160 room boutique hotel and 447 residential units the hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we will be a partner total expected costs range from 270 million to 285 million and stabilization is expected in 20182019 construction commenced on phase ii in july 2015 phase ii is also expected to include 134 forsale condominium units with an expected total cost of 70 million to 75 million additionally as part of the second phase we entered into a ground lease agreement with partners healthcare to bring more than 700000 square feet of office space to assembly row the ground lease agreement includes a purchase option partners healthcare commenced construction on this new building in september 2014 and plans to relocate over 4500 employees to assembly row starting in 2016 

we invested 41 million in assembly row in 2015  and expect to invest between 100 million and 125 million in assembly row in 2016  

our pike  rose project in north bethesda md a longterm multiphased mixeduse development project currently has zoning entitlements to build 16 million square feet of commercialuse buildings and 1605 residential units phase i of pike  rose includes 493 residential units 157000 square feet of retail space and 79000 square feet of office space in late june 2014 our 174 unit residential building opened and achieved stabilized occupancy in the 1st quarter 2015 as of december 31 2015  132000 square feet of the retail space and 45000 square feet of the office space in phase i is open and in july the first tenants moved into our 319 unit residential building we expect the remaining retail office and 319 unit residential building to open in early 2016 and expect phase i to stabilize in 2016 total expected costs for phase i of pike  rose range from 265 million to 270 million of which 259 million has been incurred to date

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

 35 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt we may also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through new or assumed mortgages 

at december 31 2015  the leasable square feet in our properties was 935  occupied and 943  leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

samecenter 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2015  and the comparison of 2015  and 2014  all or a portion of 77 properties were considered samecenter and fourteen properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2015  three properties were moved from acquisition to samecenter three properties were moved from samecenter to redevelopment two properties were removed from samecenter as they were sold during 2015 and one property was moved from redevelopment to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2014  for the year ended december 31 2014  and the comparison of 2014  and 2013  all or a portion of 78 properties were considered samecenter and thirteen properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2014  two properties were moved from samecenter to redevelopment one property was moved from redevelopment to samecenter and one property was moved from redevelopment as it was vacant and was demolished in 2014 compared to the designations as of december 31 2013  while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move redevelopment properties to samecenter once they have stabilized which is typically considered 95 occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from same center when the redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to samecenter once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion

real estate taxes 

real estate tax expense increased 93 million  or 122  to 858 million  in 2015  compared to 765 million  in 2014  due primarily to assembly row and pike  rose higher assessments at our samecenter and redevelopment properties and properties acquired in 2015  and 2014  partially offset by the sale of our houston street and courtyard shops properties in april 2015 and november 2015 respectively 

property operating income 

property operating income increased 364 million  or 77  to 5106 million  in 2015  compared to 4742 million  in 2014    this increase is primarily due to portions of assembly row and pike  rose opening beginning in second quarter 2014 growth in earnings at samecenter and redevelopment properties and properties acquired in 2015  and 2014  partially offset by the sale of our houston street and courtyard shops properties in april 2015 and november 2015 respectively 

other 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 14 million  or 15  to 926 million  in 2015  compared to 939 million  in 2014  this decrease is due primarily to the following

discontinued operations— income 

income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that were disposed prior to january 1 2014 which were required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported operating income of 09 million  for 2013 primarily represents the operating income for the period during which we owned properties sold in 2013  

discontinued operations—gain on sale of real estate 

the 239 million  gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations for 2013 is due to the sale of the fee interest in our final building at fifth avenue on july 22 2013 and the sale of the fee interest in our building in forest hills on september 10 2013 

gain on sale of real estate 

the 44 million  gain on sale of real estate for 2014 is due to our portion of the gain resulting from the partnerships sale of the fee interest in pleasant shops in weymouth massachusetts 

the 50 million  gain on sale of real estate for 2013 is primarily due to the sale of the fee interest in the land under an office building at our village of shirlington property in arlington virginia that was subject to a long term ground lease the ground lease included an option for the tenant to purchase the fee interest 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

at december 31 2015  we had 210 million  of cash and cash equivalents and 535 million  borrowings outstanding on our 6000 million  revolving credit facility that matures on april 21 2017  subject to a oneyear extension at our option in addition we have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 10 billion our 2750 million  unsecured term loan that matures on november 21 2018  subject to a oneyear extension at our option also has an option subject to bank approval to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to 3500 million as of december 31 2015  we had the capacity to issue up to 1902 million  in common shares under our atm equity program 

for 2015  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 3240 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 1097 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of 

 42 

debt fees was 11  during 2015  we accessed the public debt markets twice issuing 200 million of 450 senior notes in march 2015 that mature on december 1 2044 and in september 2015 issuing 250 million of 255 senior notes that mature on january 15 2021 the net proceeds of these two offerings after net issuance premium underwriting fees and other costs were approximately 4562 million  we used the net proceeds from these transactions to redeem our 620 senior notes prior to their original maturity date of january 15 2017 and repay 147 million of mortgage debt that had a weighted average interest rate of 79 during 2016 we have only 94 million of debt maturing 

we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm equity program our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2016  will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and future phases of santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment which is the result of construction on phase ii at both assembly row and pike  rose and construction of the 234500 square foot office building at santana row with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years our capital investments will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor our revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 137 million  to 3598 million  during 2015  from 3461 million  during 2014  the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before certain noncash items partially offset by the timing of interest payments and other operating costs 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 424 million  to 3538 million  during 2015  from 3962 million  during 2014  the decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to

g at december 31 2015  we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 130 million  which are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the trust 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2015  we had a joint venture arrangement the “partnership” with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by clarion partners “clarion” we owned 30  of the equity in the partnership and clarion owned 70  we held a general partnership interest however clarion also held a general partnership interest and had substantive participating rights we could not make significant decisions without clarion’s approval accordingly we accounted for our interest in the partnership using the equity method as of december 31 2015  the partnership owned six  retail real estate properties we were the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also had the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest accounting policies for the partnership were similar to accounting policies followed by the trust at december 31 2015  our investment in the partnership was 317 million  and the partnership had 344 million  of mortgages payable outstanding 

on january 13 2016  we acquired clarions 70 interest and assumed the related mortgage obligations 

other than the joint venture described above and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015  that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2015  



 

  46 

our revolving credit facility term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2015  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2015  

  



 

 interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive loss income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of shareholders equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

as of december 31 2015  we are party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 262  both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in 2015  2014  and 2013  and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

 47 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90  of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

in addition to ffo we have also included ffo excluding the early extinguishment of debt charges in 2015 2014 and 2013 which relate to the early redemption of our 620 senior notes in 2015 our 565 senior notes and east bay bridge mortgage loan in 2014 and our 540 senior notes 595 senior notes and 750 mortgages loans in 2013 we believe the unusual nature of these charges being makewhole payments on the remaining principal and interest on the redeemed notesmortgages is worthy of separate evaluation and consequently have provided both relevant metrics 

 48 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders and to ffo available for common shareholders excluding early extinguishment of debt is as follows 



  

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2015  we were party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the rate on the 2750 million  term loan at 262  

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial 

 49 

instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2044 or with respect to capital lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2015  we had 25 billion  of fixedrate debt outstanding including our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements we also had capital lease obligations of 716 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2015  had been 10  higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 1579 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2015  had been 10  lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 1795 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2015  we had 629 million  of variable rate debt outstanding which consisted of 535 million  on our revolving credit facility and 94 million  of municipal bonds based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 06 million  and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 06 million  conversely if market interest rates decreased 10  our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 05 million  with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports such as this report on form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our president and chief executive officer and executive vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure these controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in rule 13a15e promulgated under the exchange act rules adopted by the sec require that we present the conclusions of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and executive vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america this process includes policies and procedures that 

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework  in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 

 51 

among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report and provides reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

 investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our longterm weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth and increased value our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories 

 investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion acquisition and development opportunities we consider such factors as

 employees 

at february 6 2015  we had 269 fulltime employees and 136 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for 

 5 

substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants demand for our retail spaces has been strong and while there can be no assurance that this will continue we remain optimistic given the trends we have seen over the past few years   however any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result while our anchor tenant space is currently well occupied we have seen an overall decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 24 billion  of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 5637 million was secured by all or a portion of 14 of our real estate projects and approximately 716 million  represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 344 million  of debt secured by two properties as of december 31 2014  approximately 24 billion   996  of our debt as of december 31 2014  is fixed rate debt which includes all of our property secured debt our capital lease obligations and our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements our unconsolidated joint venture’s debt of 344 

 7 

million  is also fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 as of december 31 2014  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own such as santana row in san jose california assembly row in somerville massachusetts and pike  rose in north bethesda maryland we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 8 

during 2014  construction on phase i of both assembly row and pike  rose continued with portions of both projects opening in 2014 and the remainder of phase i of both projects expected to be completed in 2015 additionally we plan to proceed with the development of phase ii at pike  rose with construction expected to commence in the first half of 2015 at santana row we completed and stabilized the new 212 unit residential building and commenced construction in q4 2014 on a new 225500 square foot office building a further discussion of these projects expected costs and current status can be found in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the outlook subsection 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90  of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that 

 9 

additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 24 billion  of debt outstanding as of december 31 2014  approximately 2844 million  bears interest at variable rates of which 2750 million  is effectively fixed through two  interest rate swap agreements we have a 6000 million  revolving credit facility on which no  balance is outstanding at december 31 2014  that bears interest at libor plus 90 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders the interest rate on our 2750 million  term loan is currently fixed at 262  as a result of two  interest rate swap agreements we may enter into this type of hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

  10 

competition cause a reduction in revenues from one or more properties although real estate taxes typically do not increase upon a reduction in such revenues 

each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result 

 11 

in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2014  we held seven predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” and properties owned in a “downreit” structure additionally in fourth quarter 2014 we entered into a joint venture agreement related to the hotel component of phase ii of our pike  rose development project we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2014  we held the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments except the hotel investment discussed above we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

on july 1 2004 we entered into a joint venture with clarion for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30  ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 our joint venture with clarion is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate these provisions at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2014  this joint venture owned six  properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and 

 12 

operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

  13 

we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer of ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

  14 

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

we face risks relating to cybersecurity attacks that could cause loss of confidential information and other business disruptions 

we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions and manage our business and our business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks these could include attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and computer systems attacks can be both individual andor highly organized attempts organized by very sophisticated hacking organizations we employ a number of measures to prevent detect and mitigate these threats which include password encryption frequent password change events firewall detection systems antivirus software inplace frequent backups a redundant data system for core applications and annual penetration testing however there is no guarantee such efforts will be 

 15 

successful in preventing a cyber attack a cybersecurity attack could compromise the confidential information of our employees tenants and vendors a successful attack could disrupt and otherwise adversely affect our business operations 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2014  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 89  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 202 million  square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2014  total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 2700  leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 31  of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2014  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

 16 

geographic diversification 

our 89  real estate projects are located in 13  states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2014  

  



  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three  to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one  year or less and in 2014  represented approximately 56  of total rental income 

 17 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2014  for each of the 10 years beginning with 2015  and after 2024  in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2014  

  



lease rollovers 

for 2014  we signed leases for a total of 1765000  square feet of retail space including 1545000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 16  on a cash basis and 29  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 704000  square feet at an average rental increase of 25  on a cash basis and 38  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 840000  square feet at an average rental increase of 11  on a cash basis and 23  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 4446 per square foot for new leases and 127 per square foot for renewals in 2014  

for 2013  we signed leases for a total of 1629000  square feet of retail space including 1370000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 20  on a cash basis and 33  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 586000  square feet at an average rental increase of 35  on a cash basis and 51  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 784000  square feet at an average rental increase of 10  on a cash basis and 21  on a straightline basis tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 4583 per square foot for new leases and 170 for renewal leases in 2013  

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure 

the leases signed in 2014  generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2017  and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 12 to 15 million square feet of retail space each year and expect that volume for 2015  will be in line with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust “reit” specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as in california as of december 31 2014  we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 89  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 202 million  square feet in total the real estate projects were 956  leased and 947  occupied at december 31 2014  a joint venture in which we own a 30  interest owned six  retail real estate projects totaling approximately 08 million  square feet as of december 31 2014  in total the joint venture properties in which we own a 30  interest were 861  leased and 828  occupied at december 31 2014  we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 47  consecutive years 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2014  and 2013  our allowance for doubtful accounts was 124 million  and 127 million  respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 04 and 13 of rental income and it was 03 in 2014  reflecting positive economic changes and their impact to our tenants a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example 

 30 

in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 67 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2014  and 2013  accounts receivable includes approximately 661 million  and 606 million  respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments and general economic and real estate factors certain events such as unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 277 million  and 7 million  respectively for 2014  and 275 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2013  we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 45 million  and 2 million  respectively for 2014  and 48 million  and 1 million  respectively for 2013  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 29 million  and 7 million  respectively for 2014  and 9 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2013  the amount of capitalized internal costs 

 31 

for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 7 million  1 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2014  and 6 million  1 million  and 5 million  respectively for 2013  total capitalized costs were 367 million  and 345 million  for 2014  and 2013  respectively 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by 

 32 

management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income

on august 28 2014  we amended our term loan agreement and lowered the spread over libor by 40  basis points from 130  basis points to 90  basis points based on our current credit rating the amendment also provides us the option to extend the maturity date by one year 

on february 12 2014 we replaced our existing at the market “atm” equity program with a new atm equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3000 million  we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities fund our development and redevelopment pipeline repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility andor for general corporate purposes for the three months ended december 31 2014  we issued 469200  common shares at the weighted average price per share of 13254  for net cash proceeds of 615 million  and paid 06 million  in commissions and less than 01 million  in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares for the year ended december 31 2014  we issued 1768583  common shares at a weighted average price per share of 12209  for net cash proceeds of 2136 million  and paid 22 million  in commissions and 02 million  in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares as of december 31 2014  we had the capacity to issue up to 841 million  in common shares under our atm equity program 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates we have generally continued to see an encouraging operating environment for many of our tenants as well as strong levels of interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces while there can be no assurance that these conditions will continue we remain optimistic given the trends we have seen over the past few years we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base partially mitigates any negative change in the economic environment however any significant reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2014  no single tenant accounted for more than 31  of annualized base rent 

 34 

our properties are located primarily in densely populated andor affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities in 2015  we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately 67 million 

we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row our most recent 212 unit residential building was completed during second quarter the building was 986 leased as of december 31 2014  and had a total cost of 76 million we are also proceeding with our next phase of redevelopment which is a six story building including approximately 225500 square feet of office space 1500 square feet of retail space and 670 parking spaces after current phases we have approximately 9 acres remaining for further redevelopment and entitlements in place for an additional 348 residential units and 69000 square feet of commercial space we are currently in the process of seeking additional entitlements and have under control an additional 12 acres of land adjacent to santana row 

we continue to invest in the development at assembly row which is a longterm development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years the carrying value of the development portion of this project at december 31 2014  is approximately 359 million  the project currently has zoning entitlements to build 34 million  square feet of commercialuse buildings 1843  residential units and a 170  room hotel the first phase consists of approximately 326000 square feet of retail space and 98000 square feet of office space both owned by the trust and 450 residential units owned by avalonbay communities the massachusetts bay transit authority mbta constructed the new orange line tstop at the property which opened in september 2014 minimal amounts of construction remain to be completed on the first phase the retail space in phase i opened during 2014 and currently is 973 leased the office space will open in 2015 phase i is expected to stabilize in 20152016 total expected costs for phase i of assembly row range from 190 million to 200 million net of reimbursements of which 189 million has been incurred to date in total we invested 74 million in assembly row in 2014  net of public funding and expect to invest between 20 million and 30 million in assembly row in 2015  

additionally we entered into a ground lease agreement with partners healthcare to bring more than 700000 square feet of office space and an additional 100000 square feet of retail space to assembly row the ground lease agreement includes a purchase option partners healthcare commenced construction on this new building in september 2014 and plans to relocate over 4500 employees to assembly row starting in 2016 

our pike  rose project in north bethesda md a longterm multiphased mixeduse project currently has zoning entitlements to build 16 million square feet of commercialuse buildings and 1605 residential units phase i of pike  rose involved demolition of roughly 25 of the gross leasable area at midpike plaza which was completed during the second quarter of 2012 the remainder of midpike plaza was fully demolished in the third quarter of 2014 phase i of pike  rose includes 493 residential units 151000 square feet of retail space and 79000 square feet of office space in late june 2014 our 174 unit residential building opened and is 851 leased as of december 31 2014  approximately 79000 square feet of the retail space in phase i opened in 2014 and we expect the remaining retail office and 319 unit residential building to open in 2015 we expect phase i to stabilize in 20152016 total expected costs for phase i of pike  rose range from 255 million to 265 million of which 217 million has been incurred to date 

additionally we are proceeding with development of phase ii of pike  rose and expect building construction to commence in the first half of 2015 phase ii is expected to include approximately 185000 square feet of retail space a 177room selectservice hotel and 264 residential units total expected costs range from 195 million to 200 million and stabilization is expected in 20182019 the hotel will be owned and operated by a joint venture in which we will be a partner phase ii is also expected to include 104 forsale condominium units with an expected cost of 50 million to 53 million we invested 128 million in pike  rose in 2014  and expect to invest between 80 million and 110 million in pike  rose in 2015  

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt we may also finance our 

 35 

acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through new or assumed mortgages 

at december 31 2014  the leasable square feet in our properties was 947  occupied and 956  leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

samecenter 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2014  and the comparison of 2014  and 2013  all or a portion of 78 properties were considered samecenter and thirteen properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2014  two properties were moved from samecenter to redevelopment one property was moved from redevelopment to samecenter and one property was moved from redevelopment as it was vacant and was demolished in 2014 compared to the designations as of december 31 2013  for the year ended december 31 2013  and the comparison of 2013  and 2012  all or a portion of 79 properties were considered samecenter and eleven properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2013  three properties were moved from acquisition to samecenter and one property was moved from redevelopment to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2012  while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move redevelopment properties to samecenter once they have stabilized which is typically considered 95 occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from same center when the redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to samecenter once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

at december 31 2014  we had 480 million  of cash and cash equivalents and no  borrowings outstanding on our 6000 million  revolving credit facility that matures on april 21 2017  subject to a oneyear extension at our option in addition we have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 10 billion our 2750 million  unsecured term loan that matures on november 21 2018  subject to a oneyear extension at our option also has an option subject to bank approval to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to 3500 million as of december 31 2014  we had the capacity to issue up to 841 million  in common shares under our atm equity program 

for 2014  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 795 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 125 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 107  in november 2014 we accessed the public debt markets issuing 250 million  of 30year unsecured senior notes which bear interest at 45 the opportunistic issuance resulted in net proceeds of 2446 million  which were used to address 186 million of our 2016 debt maturities 

 42 

we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm equity program our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2015  will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and future phases of santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment in 2015 which is the result of the continued development at both assembly row and pike  rose with openings of portions of both projects in 2015 the commencement of construction on phase ii of pike  rose and the current phase of santana row with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years our capital investments will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor our revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 316 million  to 3461 million  during 2014  from 3145 million  during 2013  the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before certain noncash items

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive loss income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of shareholders equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

as of december 31 2014  we are party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 262  both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in 2014 2013 and 2012 and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90  of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

in addition to ffo we have also included ffo excluding the early extinguishment of debt charges in 2014 and 2013 which relate to the early redemption of our 565 senior notes and east bay bridge mortgage loan in 2014 and our 540 senior notes 595 senior notes and 750 mortgages loans in 2013 we believe the unusual nature of these charges being makewhole payments on the remaining principal and interest on the redeemed notesmortgages is worthy of separate evaluation and consequently have provided both relevant metrics

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders and to ffo available for common shareholders excluding early extinguishment of debt is as follows 



 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2014  we were party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the rate on the 2750 million  term loan at 262  

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the 

 49 

fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2044 or with respect to capital lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2014  we had 23 billion  of fixedrate debt outstanding including our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements we also had capital lease obligations of 716 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2014  had been 10  higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 1336 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2014  had been 10  lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 1498 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2014  we had 94 million  of variable rate debt outstanding which consisted of municipal bonds our revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance as of december 31 2014  based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 01 million  and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 01 million  conversely if market interest rates decreased 10  our annual interest expense would decrease by less than 01 million  with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports such as this report on form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our president and chief executive officer and executive vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure these controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in rule 13a15e promulgated under the exchange act rules adopted by the sec require that we present the conclusions of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and executive vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america this process includes policies and procedures that 

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in the 2013 internal control—integrated framework  in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 

 51 

among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report and provides reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of internal control over financial reporting 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our most recent fiscal year based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of our most recent fiscal year and provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

 employees 

at february 7 2014  we had  266 fulltime employees and 159 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of sales and marketing of goods and services such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property economic conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants we have continued to see signs of improvement for many of our tenants as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces while there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the improved trends we have seen over the past few years however any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result as a result of the economic conditions over the last few years we have seen a decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 23 billion  of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 5678 million was secured by all or a portion of 13 of our real estate projects and approximately 717 million  represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 569 million  of debt secured by four properties as of december 31 2013  approximately 23 billion 996 of our debt as of 

 7 

december 31 2013  is fixed rate debt which includes all of our property secured debt our capital lease obligations and our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements our unconsolidated joint venture’s debt of 569 million  is also fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt agreements 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own such as santana row in san jose california assembly row in somerville massachusetts and pike  rose midpike plaza in rockville maryland we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not 

 8 

exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

during 2013  construction continued on phase i of assembly row phase i of pike  rose and a new residential building at santana row and we anticipate that our total investment in the current phase of these projects will approximate 530 million there are a number of risks associated with these projects including the size of the overall aggregate investment in these projects at assembly row we are dependent on the performance of third parties to deliver significant aspects of the project that are critical to our success in addition at this project our projected investment assumes that we will receive public funding which has been committed but has not been entirely funded at both assembly row and pike  rose a substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure the value of which may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases furthermore with respect to residential development at pike  rose and santana row we will be delivering these units into a residential environment in 20142016 that is uncertain 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities 

 9 

and mortgage loans from third parties if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms additionally we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 23 billion  of debt outstanding as of december 31 2013  approximately 2844 million  bears interest at variable rates of which 2750 million  is effectively fixed through two  interest rate swap agreements we have a 6000 million  revolving credit facility on which no  balance is outstanding at december 31 2013  that bears interest at libor plus 90 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders the interest rate on our 2750 million  term loan is currently fixed at 302  as a result of two  interest rate swap agreements we may enter into this type of hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

  10 

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from online retailers outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of sales and marketing of goods such as direct mail this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations 

 11 

related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could seriously disrupt our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2013  we held five predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” and properties owned in a “downreit” structure we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2013  we held the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

on july 1 2004 we entered into a joint venture with clarion for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 our joint venture with clarion is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate these provisions at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2013  this joint venture owned seven  properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and 

 12 

operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and 

 13 

aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

  14 

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2013  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 87  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 195 million  square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2013  total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 2500  leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 35  of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2013  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 87  real estate projects are located in 13  states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2013  

  



  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

 16 

commercial property leases generally range from three  to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one  year or less and in 2013  represented approximately 47  of total rental income 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2013  for each of the 10 years beginning with 2014  and after 2023  in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2013  

  



lease rollovers 

for 2013  we signed leases for a total of 1629000  square feet of retail space including 1370000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 20  on a cash basis and 33  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 586000  square feet at an average rental increase of 35  on a cash basis and 51  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 784000  square feet at an average rental increase of 10  on a cash basis and 21  on a straightline basis 

for 2012  we signed leases for a total of 1965000  square feet of retail space including 1800000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 13  on a cash basis and 23  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 882000  square feet at an average rental increase of 23  on a cash basis and 32  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 918000  square feet at an average rental increase of 4  on a cash basis and 14  on a straightline basis 

tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 4583 per square foot for new leases and 170 per square foot for renewals in 2013 tenant improvements and incentives for comparable spaces were 3620 per square foot for new leases and 278 for renewal leases in 2012 in 2013 tenant improvements and incentives increased for new leases relative to our historical experience primarily due to one grocery anchor lease at ellisburg shopping center and an anchor tenant at westgate center which is currently being redeveloped in future periods we expect tenant improvements and incentives to return to levels more in line with our historical experience however our historical experience has also shown that costs have generally increased over time even absent specific tenant circumstances as noted above 

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in atypical circumstances management may exercise judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure 

 17 

the leases signed in 2013  generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2015 and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

historically we have executed comparable space leases for 12 to 15 million square feet of retail space each year we believe our leasing volume for 2014 will be inline with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2013  except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

on february 7 2014  there were  3128 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 46  consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2013  and 2012  were 297  per share and 280  per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2014  or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

  



 25 

distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 

recent sales of unregistered shares 

under the terms of various operating partnership agreements of certain of our affiliated limited partnerships the interest of limited partners in those limited partnerships may be redeemed subject to certain conditions for cash or an equivalent number of our common shares at our option during the three months ended december 31 2013  there were no redemptions of operating partnership units all other equity securities sold by us during 2013  that were not registered have been previously reported in a quarterly report on form 10q 

purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers 

during the fourth quarter of 2013  no equity securities were purchased by us and 230  restricted common shares were forfeited by former employees

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed “forwardlooking statements” see “item 1a risk factors” in this report for important information regarding these forwardlooking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust “reit” specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as in california as of december 31 2013  we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 87  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 195 million  square feet in total the real estate projects were 958  leased and 951  occupied at december 31 2013  a joint venture in which we own a 30  interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 10 million  square feet as of december 31 2013  in total the joint venture properties in which we own a 30  interest were 849  leased and 849  occupied at december 31 2013  we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 46  consecutive years 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may 

 29 

affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2013  and 2012  our allowance for doubtful accounts was 127 million  and 159 million  respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 04 and 13 of rental income and it was 01 in 2013  reflecting positive economic changes and their impact to our tenants a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 62 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2013  and 2012  accounts receivable includes approximately 606 million  and 561 million  respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as 

 30 

necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets and general economic and real estate factors certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 275 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2013  and 129 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2012  we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 48 million  and 1 million  respectively for 2013  and 52 million  and 1 million  respectively for 2012  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 9 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2013  and 9 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2012  the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 6 million  1 million  and 5 million  respectively for 2013  and 5 million  1 million  and 5 million  respectively for 2012  

additionally interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

 31 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 201302 comprehensive income topic 220 reporting amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201302 requires entities to disclose certain information relating to amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income we adopted the standard effective january 1 2013 and it did not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements 

2013 significant property acquisitions and dispositions

the purchase price allocation will be completed after our valuation studies are complete additionally we have entered into an agreement to acquire the interest of one of the noncontrolling interest holders in the grove at shrewsbury for approximately 9 million  in 2015 

2013 significant debt and equity transactions 

during 2013 we repaid the following mortgage loans 



  

                        

1 the payoff included a prepayment premium totaling 44 million for all four mortgages which is included in early extinguishment of debt in 2013 

on april 22 2013 we upsized our 4000 million  revolving credit facility to 6000 million  and extended the maturity date to april 21 2017  subject to a oneyear extension at our option under the amended credit facility the spread over libor is 90 basis points based on our credit rating as of may 1 2013 

on may 9 2013  we issued 2750 million  of fixed rate senior notes that mature on june 1 2023  and bear interest at 275  the net proceeds from this note offering after issuance discounts underwriting fees and other costs were approximately 2693 million  

 33 

on june 9 2013  we redeemed our 1350 million   540  senior notes prior to the original maturity date of december 1 2013  the redemption price of 1385 million  included a makewhole premium of approximately 33 million  and accrued but unpaid interest of 02 million  the makewhole premium is included in early extinguishment of debt in 2013

we have an at the market atm equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 300 million we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities fund our development and redevelopment pipeline repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility andor for general corporate purposes for the three months ended december 31 2013 we issued 659938  common shares at the weighted average price per share of 10477  for net cash proceeds of 684 million  and paid 07 million  in commissions and 01 million  in additional offering expenses related to to the sales of these common shares for the year ended december 31 2013 we issued 1734974  common shares at a weighted average price per share of 10801  for net cash proceeds of 1852 million  and paid 20 million  in commissions and 02 million  in additional offering expenses related to the sales of these common shares as of december 31 2013 we had the capacity to issue up to 260 million  in common shares under our atm equity program 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates we have continued to see signs of improvement for many of our tenants as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces while there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the improved trends we have seen over the past few years we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base mitigates the negative impact of the economic environment however any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2013 no single tenant accounted for more than 35  of annualized base rent 

our properties are generally located in densely populated affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities in 2014  we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately 26 million 

we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row which currently has zoning entitlements to build an additional 348 residential units and 305000 square feet of retail and office space the first phase of our new 212 unit residential building will be completed in first quarter 2014 with the remainder of the building expected to be completed by mid2014 the building is expected to stabilize in 2014 and to cost approximately 75 million of which 66 million has been incurred to date 

we continue to invest in the development at assembly row which is a longterm development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years the carrying value of the development portion of this project at december 31 2013  is approximately 259 million the project currently has zoning entitlements to build 23 million square feet of commercialuse buildings 2100 residential units and a 200 room hotel in december 2011 we entered into agreements with avalonbay communities avalonbay for a portion of the first phase of development at assembly row which will include 450 residential units by avalonbay and approximately 326000 square feet of retail space and 98000 square feet of office space both by the trust the massachusetts bay transit authority mbta is constructing the new orange line tstop at the property our construction on the first phase commenced during the first quarter 2012 total expected costs for phase i of assembly row range from 190 million to 200 million of which 115 million has been incurred to date we expect phase i to open in 2014 and stabilize in 2015 additionally during 2013 we continued our infrastructure work in total we invested 89 million in assembly row in 2013 net of public funding and expect to invest between 65 million and 85 million in 2014  net of expected public funding 

 34 

in the third quarter 2012 we broke ground on the first phase of pike  rose in rockville md a longterm multiphased mixeduse project located on a portion of our midpike plaza property the property currently has zoning entitlements to build 17 million square feet of commercialuse buildings and 1583 residential units phase i of pike  rose involves demolition of roughly 25 of the existing gross leasable area at midpike plaza which was completed during the second quarter 2012 and construction of 493 residential units 151000 square feet of retail space and 79000 square feet of office space total expected costs for phase i of pike  rose range from 245 million to 255 million of which 106 million has been incurred to date we expect a portion of phase i to open in 2014 and the remainder in 2015 and expect phase i to stabilize in 20152016 we invested 98 million in pike  rose in 2013 and expect to invest between 80 million to 110 million in 2014 related to phase 1 

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions tenant demand and our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities initially some of our acquisitions do not contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt on occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through new or assumed mortgages 

at december 31 2013  the leasable square feet in our properties was 951  occupied and 958  leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

samecenter 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2013  and the comparison of 2013  and 2012  all or a portion of 79 properties were considered samecenter and eleven properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2013  three properties were moved from acquisition to samecenter and one property was moved from redevelopment to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2012  for the year ended december 31 2012  and the comparison of 2012  and 2011  all or a portion of 75 properties were considered samecenter and eight properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2012  four properties were removed from samecenter and two properties were added to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2011  while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move redevelopment properties to samecenter once they have stabilized which is typically considered 95 occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from same center when the redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to samecenter once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion

rental income consists primarily of minimum rent cost reimbursements from tenants and percentage rent rental income increased 400 million  or 69  to 6201 million  in 2013  compared to 5801 million  in 2012  due primarily to the following 

 other property income 

other property income decreased 80 million  or 398  to 122 million  in 2013  compared to 202 million  in 2012  included in other property income are items which although recurring tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period such as lease termination fees this decrease is primarily due to lower lease termination fees at same center properties largely from a 60 million lease termination fee received in 2012 from an anchor tenant at ellisburg shopping center 

 36 

property expenses 

total property expenses increased 114 million  or 64  to 1905 million  in 2013  compared to 1791 million  in 2012  changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below 

rental expenses 

rental expenses increased 61 million  or 54  to 1187 million  in 2013  compared to 1126 million  in 2012  this increase is primarily due to the following

real estate taxes 

real estate tax expense increased 53 million  or 80  to 718 million  in 2013  compared to 665 million  in 2012  due primarily to net higher assessments at samecenter properties and properties acquired in 2013  and 2012  

property operating income 

property operating income increased 202 million  or 47  to 4470 million  in 2013  compared to 4267 million  in 2012  this increase is primarily due to growth in earnings at samecenter properties properties acquired in 2013  and 2012  and redevelopment properties 

other 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 84 million  or 74  to 1050 million  in 2013  compared to 1133 million  in 2012  this decrease is due primarily to the following

early extinguishment of debt 

the 133 million  early extinguishment of debt in 2013  relates to the makewhole premiums paid as part of the early redemption of our 540 senior notes and 595 senior notes the prepayment premium on our 75 mortgage loans and the related writeoff of unamortized debt fees 

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense increased 08 million  or 26  to 320 million  in 2013  from 312 million  in 2012  this increase is due primarily to an increase in employee related costs and transaction costs partially offset by costs incurred in 2012 related to the cfo transition 

 37 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 191 million  or 135  to 1608 million  in 2013  from 1417 million  in 2012  this increase is due primarily to 2013  and 2012  acquisitions and accelerated depreciation due to the change in use of a redevelopment property 

discontinued operations— income 

income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that have been disposed or will be disposed which is required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported operating income of 09 million   and  14 million  for 2013 and 2012  respectively primarily represents the operating income for the period during which we owned properties sold in 2013  

discontinued operations—gain on sale of real estate 

the 239 million  gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations for 2013 is due to the sale of the fee interest in our final building at fifth avenue on july 22 2013 and the sale of the fee interest in our building in forest hills on september 10 2013 

gain on sale of real estate 

the  50 million  gain on sale of real estate for 2013 is primarily due to the sale of the fee interest in the land under an office building at our village of shirlington property in arlington virginia that was subject to a long term ground lease the ground lease included an option for the tenant to purchase the fee interest 

the  119 million  gain on sale of real estate in 2012 is due to the sale of our newbury street partnerships entire portfolio of three buildings on october 31 2011 due to the timing of receiving financial information from the general partner our share of earnings was recorded one quarter in arrears therefore we recognized the gain on sale of 119 million in 2012

the 03 million of income from early extinguishment of debt in 2011 is due to the write off of unamortized debt premium net of a 30 prepayment premium and unamortized debt fees related to the payoff of our mortgage loan on tower shops prior to its contractual payment date 

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense increased 22 million  or 75  to 312 million  in 2012  from 290 million  in 2011  this increase is due primarily to costs related to our cfo change and higher personnel related costs partially offset by lower acquisition costs in 2012 compared to 2011 

 40 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 158 million  or 126  to 1417 million  in 2012  from 1259 million  in 2011  this increase is due primarily to 2011 acquisitions and capital improvements at samecenter and redevelopment properties 

discontinued operations— income 

income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that have been disposed or will be disposed which is required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported operating income of 14 million  and  22 million  for 2012 and 2011 respectively represents the operating income for the period during which we owned properties solddisposed of prior to december 31 2013 

discontinued operations— gain on deconsolidation of vie 

the  20 million  gain on deconsolidation of vie in 2011 is the result of the refinancing of a mortgage note receivable on a shopping center in norwalk connecticut resulting in us no longer being the primary beneficiary of the vie see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction 

discontinued operations—gain on sale of real estate 

the 151 million  gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations in 2011 is primarily due to the sale of feasterville shopping center on july 12 2011 

gain on sale of real estate 

the 119 million gain on sale of real estate in 2012 is due to the sale of our newbury street partnerships entire portfolio of three buildings on october 31 2011 due to the timing of receiving information from the general partner our share of earnings was recorded one quarter in arrears therefore we recognized the gain on sale of 119 million in 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

at december 31 2013 we had 889 million  of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings outstanding on our 6000 million  revolving credit facility that matures on april 21 2017  in addition we have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 10 billion our 2750 million  unsecured term loan that matures on november 21 2018  also has an option subject to bank approval to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to 3500 million as of december 31 2013  we had the capacity to issue up to 260 million  in common shares under our atm equity program and plan to increase the availability to 300 million during q1 2014 

for 2013  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 760 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 105 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 127  during 2013 we accessed the public debt markets twice issuing 275 million of 275 senior notes in may 2013 that mature on june 1 2023 and in december 2013 issuing 300 million of 395 senior notes that mature on january 15 2024 the net proceeds of these two offerings after issuance discounts underwriting fees and other costs were approximately 5640 million we used the net proceeds from both of these transactions to address our 2013 and 2014 debt maturities as follows 

 41 



consequently we have only 301 million of debt maturing in 2014 we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm equity program our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements and capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2014  will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and future phases of santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment in 2014 which is the result of the 212 unit residential building at santana row and the continued construction of phase 1 at both assembly row and pike  rose with expected openings of portions of both projects in 2014 over the next two years we expect to invest approximately 240 million related to the current phases of these three projects with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years our capital investments will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor our revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 179 million  to 3145 million  during 2013  from 2966 million  during 2012  the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before certain noncash items 

net cash used in investing activities increased 716 million  to 3452 million  during 2013  from 2736 million  during 2012  the increase was primarily attributable to 

 partially offset by 

 42 

 net cash provided by financing activities increased 1365 million  to 826 million  during 2013  from 539 million  used in financing activities in 2012  the increase was primarily attributable to 

 partially offset by 

 contractual commitments 

the following table provides a summary of our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2013  

  



  

 in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed the following potential commitments exist 

 43 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and after january 1 1986 an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its 2947  interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value if the other minority partner defaults in their obligation we must purchase the full interest based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2013  our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 68 million  to 75 million  

b under the terms of a partnership which owns a project in southern california if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the property owned by the partnership the other partner may require us to purchase their 10  partnership interest at a formula price based upon property operating income the purchase price for the partnership interest will be paid using our common shares or subject to certain conditions cash if the other partner does not redeem their interest we may choose to purchase the partnership interest upon the same terms 

c under the terms of various other partnership agreements the partners have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2013  a total of 285722  operating partnership units are outstanding 

d effective december 27 2013 the other member in montrose crossing has the right to require us to purchase all of its 101  interest in montrose crossing at the interests thencurrent fair market value if the other member fails to exercise its put option we have the right to purchase its interest on or after december 27 2021 at fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2013  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 7 million  to 8 million  

e effective december 30 2013 two  of the members have the right to require us to purchase their 100  and 118  ownership interests in plaza el segundo at the interests thencurrent fair market value if the members fail to exercise their put options we have the right to purchase each of their interests on or after december 30 2026 at fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2013  our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 11 million  to 13 million  also between january 1 2017 and february 1 2017 we have an option to purchase the preferred interest of another member in plaza el segundo the purchase price will be the lesser of fair value or the 49 million  stated value of the preferred interest plus any accrued and unpaid preferred returns 

f at december 31 2013  we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 159 million  which are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the trust 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have a joint venture arrangement the “partnership” with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” we own 30  of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70  we hold a general partnership interest however clarion also holds a general partnership interest and has substantive participating rights we cannot make significant decisions without clarion’s approval accordingly we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method as of december 31 2013  the partnership owned seven  retail real estate properties we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest the partnership is subject to a buysell provision which is customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate this provision at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest accounting policies for the partnership are similar to accounting policies followed by the trust at december 31 2013  our investment in the partnership was 323 million  and the partnership had approximately 569 million  of mortgages payable outstanding 

other than the joint venture described above and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2013  that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2013  



 45 

 

 our revolving credit facility term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2013  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2013  

  



 

  46 

interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of of shareholders equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

as of december 31 2013 we are party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 302  both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value hedge ineffectiveness has not impacted earnings in 2013 2012 and 2011 and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90  of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

in addition to ffo we have also included ffo excluding the current period early extinguishment of debt charge which relates to the early redemption of our 540 senior notes 595 senior notes and 750 mortgages loans we believe the unusual nature of this charge being a makewhole payment on the remaining principal and interest on the redeemed notesmortgages is worthy of separate evaluation and consequently have provided both relevant metrics 

 47 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders and to ffo available for common shareholders excluding early extinguishment of debt is as follows 



 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2013  we were party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the rate on the 2750 million  term loan at 302  

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were 

 48 

determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2031 or with respect to capital lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2013  we had 23 billion  of fixedrate debt outstanding including our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements we also had capital lease obligations of 717 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2013  had been 10  higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately   1018 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2013  had been 10  lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately   1095 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2013  we had 94 million  of variable rate debt outstanding which consisted of municipal bonds our revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance as of december 31 2013  based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 01 million  and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 01 million  conversely if market interest rates decreased 10  our annual interest expense would decrease by less than 01 million  with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

quarterly assessment 

we carried out an assessment as of december 31 2013  of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting this assessment was done under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer rules adopted by the sec require that we present the conclusions of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and the conclusions of our management about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this annual report

 49 

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports such as this report on form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our president and chief executive officer and executive vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure these controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in rule 13a15e promulgated under the exchange act rules adopted by the sec require that we present the conclusions of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and executive vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america this process includes policies and procedures that 

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in the 1992 internal control—integrated framework  in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant 

 50 

among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report and provides reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of internal control over financial reporting

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing less relevant weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property the current economic conditions including pending changes to tax laws may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants while we have seen positive signs of improvement for many of our tenants over the past two years we have seen some tenants experiencing declining sales vacating early failing to pay rent on a timely basis or filing for bankruptcy as well as seeking rent relief from us as landlord any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result as a result of the economic conditions over the last few years we have seen a decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms and may include decreases in rental rates as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 22 billion  of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 7394 million was secured by all or a portion of 19 of our real estate projects and approximately 717 million  represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 572 million  of debt secured by four properties as of december 31 2012  approximately 22 billion 996 of our debt as of 

december 31 2012  is fixed rate debt which includes all of our property secured debt our capital lease obligations and our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements our unconsolidated joint venture’s debt of 572 million  is also fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own such as santana row in san jose california assembly row in somerville massachusetts and pike  rose midpike plaza in rockville maryland we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not 

exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 we began construction on phase i of assembly row phase i of pike  rose and a new residential building at santana row and anticipate investing approximately 425 million in these projects over the next few years there are a number of risks associated with these projects including the size of the overall aggregate investment in these projects at assembly row we are dependent on the performance of third parties to deliver significant aspects of the project that are critical to our success in addition at this project our projected investment assumes that we will receive public funding which has been committed but has not been entirely funded at both assembly row and pike  rose a substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure the value of which may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases furthermore with respect to residential development at pike  rose and santana row we will be delivering these units into a residential environment in 20142016 that is uncertain 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entail risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities 

and mortgage loans from third parties while we have been able to consummate financings in recent years at favorable rates if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms than in recent years for debt financings equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential and risk profile our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 22 billion  of debt outstanding as of december 31 2012  approximately 2844 million  bears interest at variable rates of which 2750 million  is effectively fixed through two  interest rate swap agreements we have a 4000 million  revolving credit facility of which no  balance is outstanding at december 31 2012  that bears interest at libor plus 115 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders the interest rate on our 2750 million  term loan is currently fixed at 317  as a result of two  interest rate swap agreements we may enter into this type of hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 10 

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as direct mail and internet marketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the 

anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt seriously our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2012  we held five predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” and properties owned in a “downreit” structure we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2012  we held the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

on july 1 2004 we entered into a joint venture with clarion for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 our joint venture with clarion is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate these provisions at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2012  this joint venture owned seven  properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and 

operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification any modification in the tax treatment of reits could have a significant adverse impact to our net income 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and 

aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 14 

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected 

changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial results 

the financial accounting standards board fasb in conjunction with the sec has several key projects on their agenda that could impact how we currently account for our material transactions including lease accounting and other convergence projects with the international accounting standards board at this time we are unable to predict with certainty which if any proposals may be passed or what level of impact any such proposal could have on the presentation of our consolidated financial statements our results of operations and our financial ratios required by our debt covenants

as of december 31 2012  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 88  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 196 million  square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2012  total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2012  we had approximately 2500  leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 32  of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2012  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 88  real estate projects are located in 13  states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2012  

  



  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three  to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one  year or less and in 2012  represented approximately 47  of total rental income 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2012  for each of the 10 years beginning with 2013  and after 2022  in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2012  

  



lease rollovers 

for 2012  we signed leases for a total of 1965000  square feet of retail space including 1800000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 13  on a cash basis and 23  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 882000  square feet at an average rental increase of 23  on a cash basis and 32  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 918000  square feet at an average rental increase of 4  on a cash basis and 14  on a straightline basis 

for 2011  we signed leases for a total of 1417000  square feet of retail space including 1294000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 9  on a cash basis and 20  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 534000  square feet at an average rental increase of 11  on a cash basis and 21  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 760000  square feet at an average rental increase of 7  on a cash basis and 19  on a straightline basis 

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in some instances management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure 

the leases signed in 2012  generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2015 and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

historically we have executed around 300 comparable space leases a year for between 12 to 15 million square feet of retail space however in 2012 we executed approximately 400 comparable space leases for 18 million square feet leading to occupancy at december 31 2012  of 949 versus 924  at december 31 2011  we believe our leasing volume for 2013 will be more inline with our historical averages with overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all 

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2012  except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 45  consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2012  and 2011  were 280  per share and 270  per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2013  or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed “forwardlooking statements” see “item 1a risk factors” in this report for important information regarding these forwardlooking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust “reit” specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as in california as of december 31 2012  we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 88  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 196 million  square feet in total the real estate projects were 953  leased and 949  occupied at december 31 2012  a joint venture in which we own a 30  interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 10 million  square feet as of december 31 2012  in total the joint venture properties in which we own a 30  interest were 863  leased and 861  occupied at december 31 2012  we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 45  consecutive years 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2012  and 2011  our allowance for doubtful accounts was 159 million  and 176 million  respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 04 and 13 of rental income and it was 04 in 2012  reflecting positive economic changes and their impact to our tenants a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 58 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2012  and 2011  accounts receivable include approximately 561 million  and 505 million  respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets and general economic and real estate factors certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates 

and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 2 to 20 years 

the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 129 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2012  and 96 million  and 4 million  respectively for 2011  we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 52 million  and 1 million  respectively for 2012  and 46 million  and 1 million  respectively for 2011  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 9 million  and 6 million  respectively for 2012  and 8 million  and 5 million  respectively for 2011  the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 5 million  1 million  and 5 million  respectively for 2012  and 4 million  1 million  and 5 million  respectively for 2011  

additionally interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 201104 “fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss” the pronouncement was issued to provide a uniform framework for fair value measurements and related disclosures between us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements we adopted the standard effective january 1 2012 and it did not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 “comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income” asu 201105 eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income solely as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity and requires the presentation of components of net income and components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb deferred the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial 

statements we adopted the standards effective january 1 2012 and modified the presentation in our consolidated financial statements accordingly 

recently issued accounting pronouncement 

in february 2013 the fasb issued asu 20132 “comprehensive income topic 220 reporting amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income” asu 20132 requires entities to disclose certain information relating to amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this pronouncement is effective for us in the first quarter of 2013 and is not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements 

2012 significant property acquisitions 

in july and september 2012 we acquired three  residential apartment buildings with 47  units located adjacent to santana row for 90 million  these properties provide potential future redevelopment opportunities for santana row 

on december 21  2012 we acquired the fee interest in east bay bridge a 438000  square foot shopping center located in emeryville and oakland california the purchase price was 1166 million  which included the assumption of a mortgage loan with a face amount of 629 million  and a fair value of approximately 676 million  approximately 09 million  and 478 million  of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for “above market leases” and other liabilities for “below market leases” respectively additionally we acquired a 37000  square foot singletenant officewarehouse building in ontario california for 25 million  as part of the transaction we incurred a total of 09 million  of acquisition costs which are included in “general and administrative expenses” in 2012 

2012 significant equity and debt transactions and subsequent event 

on may 8 2012 we replaced our existing at the market “atm” equity program with a new program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3000 million  we intend to use the net proceeds to fund potential acquisition opportunities fund our development and redevelopment pipeline repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility andor for general corporate purposes for the three months ended december 31 2012  we issued 167736  common shares at a weighted average price per share of 10446  for net cash proceeds of 173 million  and paid 02 million  in commissions related to the sales of these common shares for the year  ended december 31 2012  we issued 1040946  common shares at a weighted average price per share of 10369  for net cash proceeds of 1064 million  and paid 14 million  in commissions related to the sales of these common shares as of december 31 2012  we had the capacity to issue up to 2134 million  in common shares under our atm equity program 

during 2012 and subsequent to yearend we repaid the following loans at par 

on july 19 2012 we issued 2500 million  of fixed rate senior notes that mature on august 1 2022 and bear interest at 300  the net proceeds from this note offering after issuance discounts underwriting fees and other costs were approximately 2448 million  

in connection with the acquisition of east bay bridge on december 21 2012 we assumed a mortgage loan with a face amount of 629 million  and a fair value of approximately 676 million  the mortgage loan bears interest at 513  and matures on march 1 2016 

final purchase price allocation of 2011 property acquisitions 

during 2012 we finalized the purchase price allocations for our december 2011 acquisitions of controlling interests in montrose crossing and plaza el segundo the purchase price for montrose crossing was 1415 million  and our 899  ownership interest was 1272 million  which was funded with cash and our prorata share of 800 million  of new mortgage 

debt approximately 29 million  and 38 million  of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for above market leases and other liabilities for below market leases respectively the purchase price for plaza el segundo was 1927 million  and our 482  ownership interest was funded with 85 million  of cash and the assumption of our prorata share of the existing 1750 million  mortgage debt approximately 75 million  and 23 million  of net assets acquired were allocated to other assets for above market leases and other liabilities for below market leases respectively the balance sheet at december 31 2011 has been adjusted to reflect the final purchase price allocation for both properties 

chief financial officer transition 

on august 15 2012 james m taylor a senior managing director in the real estate investment banking group of an affiliate of wells fargo succeeded andrew blocher as our chief financial officer we believe that the addition of mr taylor to our executive ranks will enhance our ability to source and evaluate corporate business development and strategic opportunities for more information about mr taylors appointment see our current report on form 8k filed with the sec on july 11 2012 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our properties are located in densely populated or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities in 2013  we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately 30 million 

additionally we continue to invest in the development at assembly row which is a longterm development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years the carrying value of the development portion of this project at december 31 2012  is approximately 170 million the project currently has zoning entitlements to build 23 million square feet of commercialuse buildings 2100 residential units and a 200 room hotel in december 2011 we entered into agreements with avalonbay communities avalonbay for a portion of the first phase of development at assembly row which will include 450 residential units by avalonbay and approximately 326000 square feet of retail space and 90000 square feet of office space both by the trust the massachusetts bay transit authority mbta will also construct the new orange line tstop at the property our construction on the first phase commenced during the first quarter 2012 total expected costs for phase i of assembly row range from 190 million to 200 million of which 43 million has been incurred to date we expect phase i to stabilize in 2015 additionally during 2012 we continued our infrastructure work in total we invested 22 million in assembly row in 2012  net of public funding and expect to invest between 100 million and 115 million in 2013  net of expected public funding 

in the third quarter 2012 we broke ground on the first phase of pike  rose in rockville md a longterm multiphased mixeduse project located on a portion of our midpike plaza property the property currently has zoning entitlements to build 17 million square feet of commercialuse buildings and 1583 residential units phase i of pike  rose involves demolition of roughly 25 of the existing gross leasable area at midpike plaza which was completed during the second quarter 2012 and construction of 493 residential units 151000 square feet of retail space and 79000 square feet of office space total expected costs for phase i of pike  rose range from 245 million to 255 million of which 29 million has been incurred to date we expect phase i of the project to stabilize in 20152016 we invested 43 million in pike  rose in 2012  and expect to invest between 75 million to 110 million in 2013  

we continue our ongoing redevelopment efforts at santana row and are currently under construction on a 212 unit residential building which we expect to stabilize in 2014 santana row currently has zoning entitlements to build an additional 348 residential units and 200000 square feet of retail and office space projected costs of the 212 unit residential building are 70 million to 75 million of which 22 million has been incurred to date we expect to incur the remaining costs for the project throughout 2013 and early 2014 

the development of future phases of assembly row pike  rose and santana row will be pursued opportunistically based on among other things market conditions our evaluation of whether those phases will generate an appropriate financial return and our ability to structure the development of those future phases through entitlement sales third party capital investment or otherwise 

our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates we have continued to see signs of improvement for many of our tenants as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces while there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the improved trends we have seen over the past two years while we have seen improvements over much of our portfolio we continue to see some tenants being negatively impacted by the economic environment and some filing for bankruptcy though at a lower rate than in previous years we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base mitigates the negative impact of the economic environment however any reduction in our tenants abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations during 2013 we expect to see increases in rental income as a result of our significant leasing activity over the past two years which resulted in higher occupancy starting in the latter half of 2012 we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2012  no single tenant accounted for more than 32  of annualized base rent 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities some of our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth however we believe they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt on occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through new or assumed mortgages 

at december 31 2012  the leasable square feet in our properties was 949  occupied and 953  leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

samecenter 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as discontinued operations for the year ended december 31 2012  and the comparison of 2012  and 2011  all or a portion of 77 properties were considered samecenter and eight properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2012  four properties were removed from samecenter and two properties were added to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2011  for the year ended december 31 2011  and the comparison of 2011  and 2010  all or a portion of 79 properties were considered samecenter and seven properties were considered redevelopment or expansion for the year ended december 31 2011  three properties were removed from samecenter and one property was added to samecenter compared to the designations as of december 31 2010  while there is judgment surrounding changes in designations we typically move redevelopment properties to samecenter once they have stabilized which is typically considered 95 occupancy or when the growth expected from the redevelopment has been included in the comparable periods we typically remove properties from same center when the redevelopment has or is expected to have a significant impact to property operating income within the calendar year acquisitions are moved to samecenter once we have owned the property for the entirety of comparable periods and the property is not under significant redevelopment or expansion

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

cash and cash equivalents decreased 308 million  to 370 million  at december 31 2012  however cash and cash equivalents are not the only indicator of our liquidity we also have a 4000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility which matures on july 6 2015  and had no  borrowings outstanding at december 31 2012  in addition we have an option subject to bank approval to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 8000 million  our 2750 million  unsecured term loan that matures on november 21 2018  also has an option subject to bank approval to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to 3500 million as of december 31 2012  we had the capacity to issue up to 2134 million  in common shares under our atm equity program 

for 2012  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 1860 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 15 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 14  we have approximately 1630 million  of debt maturing in 2013  of which 1350 million relates to our 540 senior notes that mature in december 2013 we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm equity program our revolving credit facility and our general ability to access the capital markets will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our debt service requirements including maturities and capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2013  will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and future phases of santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to continue to see higher levels of capital investments in our properties under development and redevelopment in 2013 which is the result of the 212 unit residential building at santana row a portion of which will be completed during 2013 and the continued construction of phase 1 at both assembly row and pike  rose with expected openings of portions of both projects in 2014 over the next two years we expect to invest approximately 425 million related to the current phases of these three projects with respect to other capital investments related to our existing properties we expect to incur levels consistent with prior years our capital investments will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor our revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity including shares issued under our atm equity program if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities increased 519 million  to 2966 million  during 2012  from 2447 million  during 2011  the increase was primarily attributable to higher net income before certain noncash items in 2012 and the payment in 2011 of the 162 million final judgment related to a previously disclosed lawsuit

expected to be refinanced at maturity and has an outstanding contractual balance of 215 million  at december 31 2012  the real estate commitments currently include the fixed 50 million  and all payments related to the current mortgage loan are included in fixed rate debt 

in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed the following potential commitments exist 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and after january 1 1986 an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its 2947  interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value if the other minority partner defaults in their obligation we must purchase the full interest based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2012  our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 65 million  to 71 million  

b under the terms of a partnership which owns a project in southern california if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the property owned by the partnership the other partner may require us to purchase their 10  partnership interest at a formula price based upon property operating income the purchase price for the partnership interest will be paid using our common shares or subject to certain conditions cash if the other partner does not redeem their interest we may choose to purchase the partnership interest upon the same terms

f at december 31 2012  we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 159 million  which are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the trust 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have a joint venture arrangement the “partnership” with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” we own 30  of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70  we hold a general partnership interest however clarion also holds a general partnership interest and has substantive participating rights we cannot make significant decisions without clarion’s approval accordingly we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method as of december 31 2012  the partnership owned seven  retail real estate properties we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest the partnership is subject to a buysell provision which is customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate this provision at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest accounting policies for the partnership are similar to accounting policies followed by the trust at december 31 2012  our investment in the partnership was 332 million  and the partnership had approximately 572 million  of mortgages payable outstanding 

other than the joint venture described above and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2012  that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

debt financing arrangements

 our revolving credit facility term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2012  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2012

interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of of shareholders equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

in november 2011 we entered into two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the rate on the 2750 million  term loan at 317  both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and are recorded at fair value hedge ineffectiveness did not impact earnings in 2012 and 2011 and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future we had no derivative instruments outstanding during 2010 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90  of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows 



 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2012  we were party to two  interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the rate on the 2750 million  term loan at 317  

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2031 or with respect to capital lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2012  we had 22 billion  of fixedrate debt outstanding including our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements and 717 million  of capital lease obligations if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2012  had been 10  higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 800 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2012  had been 10  lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 849 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2012  we had 94 million  of variable rate debt outstanding which consisted of municipal bonds our revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance as of december 31 2012  based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 01 million  and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 01 million  conversely if market interest rates decreased 10  our annual interest expense would decrease by less than 01 million  with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and executive vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america this process includes policies and procedures that 

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those 

responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report and provides reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

 investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our longterm weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth and increased value our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories

 employees 

at february 9 2012  we had 254 fulltime employees and 162 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90  of taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes our trs activities have not been material 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including without limitation 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property the current economic conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants we have seen some tenants experiencing declining sales vacating early failing to pay rent on a timely basis or filing for bankruptcy as well as seeking rent relief from us as landlord any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result as a result of the current economic conditions we have seen a decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms which may include decreases in rental rates as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2011  we had approximately 21 billion  of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 7254 million was secured by all or a portion of 21 of our real estate projects and approximately 631 million  represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 574 million  of debt secured by four properties as of december 31 2011  approximately 21 billion 996 of our debt as of december 31 2011  is fixed rate debt which includes all of our property secured debt our capital lease obligations and our 

2750 million term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two interest rate swap agreements our unconsolidated joint venture’s debt of 574 million  is also fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 as of december 31 2011  we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not look to acquire raw land for future development however we do intend to complete the development and construction of future phases of projects we already own such as santana row in san jose california assembly row in somerville massachusetts and pike  rose midpike plaza in rockville maryland we may undertake development of these and other projects on our own or bring in third parties if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if 

any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in 2012 we expect to start construction on assembly row pike  rose and additional residential units at santana row and anticipate investing approximately 500 million in these projects over the next few years while the significant size of the development investment poses a risk in itself there are a number of other risks associated with these projects at assembly row we are dependent on the performance of third parties to deliver significant aspects of the project that are critical to our success in addition at this project our projected investment assumes that we will receive public funding which has been committed but has not been entirely funded at both assembly row and pike  rose a substantial amount of our investment is related to infrastructure the value of which may be negatively impacted if we do not complete subsequent phases furthermore with respect to residential development at pike  rose and santana row we will be delivering these units into a residential environment in 20142015 that is uncertain 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere and the specific risks above the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of high quality retail focused properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties while we were able to consummate financings during 2009 2010 and 2011 if economic 

conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms than in recent years for debt financings equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 21 billion  of debt outstanding as of december 31 2011  approximately 2844 million  bears interest at variable rates of which 2750 million  is effectively fixed through two  interest rate swap agreements we have a 4000 million  revolving credit facility of which no  balance is outstanding at december 31 2011  that bears interest at libor plus 115 basis points  we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders the interest rate on our 2750 million  term loan is currently fixed at 317  as a result of two  interest rate swap agreements we may enter into this type of hedging arrangements or other transactions for all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates however the amounts we are required to pay under the term loan and any other variable rate debt to which hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

loss of our key management could adversely affect performance and the value of our common shares 

we are dependent on the efforts of our key management although we believe qualified replacements could be found for any departures of key executives the loss of their services could adversely affect our performance and the value of our common shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 10 

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as direct mail and internet marketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood earthquake environmental matters rental loss and acts of terrorism all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry and other factors outside our control as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations 

related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt seriously our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2011  we held five predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” and properties owned in a “downreit” structure we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2011  we held the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments we generally must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

on july 1 2004 we entered into a joint venture with clarion for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 our joint venture with clarion is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate these provisions at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2011  this joint venture owned seven  properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect 

their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution 

requirements because 

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 14 

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in high quality retail based properties that are typically neighborhood and community shopping centers or mixeduse properties principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors 

natural disasters and severe weather conditions could have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating results 

changing weather patterns and climatic conditions such as global warming may have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters and severe weather conditions and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures our operations are located in areas that are subject to natural disasters and severe weather conditions such as hurricanes earthquakes droughts snow storms floods and fires the occurrence of natural disasters or severe weather conditions can delay new development projects increase investment costs to repair or replace damaged properties increase operation costs increase future property insurance costs and negatively impact the tenant demand for lease space if insurance is unavailable to us or is unavailable on acceptable terms or if our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption or losses from these events our earnings liquidity or capital resources could be adversely affected

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2011  we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 87  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 193 million  square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2011  total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with 

commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2011  we had approximately 2500  leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 25  of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2011  as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 87  real estate projects are located in 13  states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2011  

  



  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from three  to ten years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one  year or less and in 2011  represented approximately 43  of total rental income 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2011  for each of the 10 years beginning with 2012  and after 2021  in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2011  

  



lease rollovers 

for 2011  we signed leases for a total of 1417000  square feet of retail space including 1294000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 9  on a cash basis and 20  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 534000  square feet at an average rental increase of 11  on a cash basis and 21  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 760000  square feet at an average rental increase of 7  on a cash basis and 19  on a straightline basis 

for 2010  we signed leases for a total of 1526000  square feet of retail space including 1455000  square feet of comparable space leases leases for which there was a prior tenant at an average rental increase of 8  on a cash basis and 18  on a straightline basis new leases for comparable spaces were signed for 640000  square feet at an average rental increase of 6  on a cash basis and 15  on a straightline basis renewals for comparable spaces were signed for 816000  square feet at an average rental increase of 9  on a cash basis and 20  on a straightline basis 

the rental increases associated with comparable spaces generally include all leases signed in armslength transactions reflecting market leverage between landlords and tenants during the period the comparison between average rent for expiring leases and new leases is determined by including minimum rent and percentage rent paid on the expiring lease and minimum rent and in some instances projections of first lease year percentage rent to be paid on the new lease in some instances management exercises judgment as to how to most effectively reflect the comparability of spaces reported in this calculation the change in rental income on comparable space leases is impacted by numerous factors including current market rates location individual tenant creditworthiness use of space market conditions when the expiring lease was signed capital investment made in the space and the specific lease structure 

the leases signed in 2011  generally become effective over the following two years though some may not become effective until 2014 and beyond further there is risk that some new tenants will not ultimately take possession of their space and that tenants for both new and renewal leases may not pay all of their contractual rent due to operating financing or other matters however these increases do provide information about the tenantlandlord relationship and the potential increase we may achieve in rental income over time 

in 2012  we expect a similar level of leasing activity compared to prior years with overall positive increases in rental income however changes in rental income associated with individual signed leases on comparable spaces may be positive or negative and we can provide no assurance that the rents on new leases will continue to increase at the above disclosed levels if at all 

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2011  except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

on february 9 2012  there were 3508 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 44  consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2011  and 2010  were 270  per share and 265  per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2012  or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

  



distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 

recent sales of unregistered shares 

under the terms of various operating partnership agreements of certain of our affiliated limited partnerships the interest of limited partners in those limited partnerships may be redeemed subject to certain conditions for cash or an equivalent number of our common shares at our option all other equity securities sold by us during 2011  that were not registered have been previously reported in a quarterly report on form 10q 

purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers 

no equity securities were purchased by us during the fourth quarter of 2011  and 13975  restricted common shares were forfeited by former employees

forwardlooking statements 

certain statements in this section or elsewhere in this report may be deemed “forwardlooking statements” see “item 1a risk factors” in this report for important information regarding these forwardlooking statements and certain risk and uncertainties that may affect us the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust “reit” specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as in california as of december 31 2011  we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 87  predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 193 million  square feet in total the real estate projects were 934  leased and 924  occupied at december 31 2011  a joint venture in which we own a 30  interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 10 million  square feet as of december 31 2011  in total the joint venture properties in which we own a 30  interest were 909  leased and occupied at december 31 2011  we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 44  consecutive years 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be 

critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2011  and 2010  our allowance for doubtful accounts was 176 million  and 187 million  respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 04 and 13 of rental income and it was 05 in 2011  reflecting positive economic changes and their impact to our tenants a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 54 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2011  and 2010  accounts receivable include approximately 505 million  and 456 million  respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews may take into account such factors as the 

historical retirement and replacement of our assets expected redevelopments the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets and general economic and real estate factors certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years 

the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including preconstruction costs real estate taxes insurance construction costs and salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved are capitalized we capitalized external and internal costs related to both development and redevelopment activities of 96 million  and 4 million  respectively for 2011  and 54 million  and 3 million  respectively for 2010  we capitalized external and internal costs related to other property improvements of 46 million  and 1 million  respectively for 2011  and 39 million  and 1 million  respectively for 2010  we capitalized external and internal costs related to leasing activities of 8 million  and 5 million  respectively for 2011  and 7 million  and 4 million  respectively for 2010  the amount of capitalized internal costs for salaries and related benefits for development and redevelopment activities other property improvements and leasing activities were 4 million  1 million  and 5 million  respectively for 2011  and 3 million  1 million  and 4 million  respectively for 2010  

additionally interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired including land building improvements leasing costs intangibles such as inplace leases assumed debt and current assets and liabilities if any based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations we consider qualitative and quantitative factors in evaluating the likelihood of a tenant exercising a below market renewal option and include such renewal options in the calculation of inplace lease value when we consider these to be bargain renewal options if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims projected to be incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in may 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update “asu” 201104 “fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss” the pronouncement was issued to provide a uniform framework for fair value measurements and related disclosures between us gaap and international financial reporting standards “ifrs” asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements this pronouncement is effective for us in the first quarter of 2012 and is not expected to have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 “comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income” asu 201105 eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity and requires the presentation of components of net income and components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb deferred the requirement to present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated 

other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements these pronouncements are effective for us in the first quarter of 2012 and will not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements

mortgage loan receivable refinancing 

prior to june 30 2011  we were the lender on a first and second mortgage loan on a shopping center and an adjacent commercial building in norwalk connecticut our carrying amount of the loans was approximately 183 million  the loans were in default and foreclosure proceedings had been filed however we were in negotiations with the borrower to refinance the loans on june 30 2011  we refinanced the existing loans with a first mortgage loan which had an initial principal balance of 119 million  bears interest at 60  and matures on june 30 2014 subject to a one year extension option the loan is secured by the shopping center in norwalk connecticut as part of the refinancing we received approximately 87 million  in cash 

because the loans were in default we had certain rights under the first mortgage loan agreement that gave us the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impacted the shopping center although we did not exercise those rights the existence of those rights in the loan agreement resulted in the entity being a variable interest entity vie additionally given our investment in both the first and second mortgage on the property the overall decline in fair market value since the loans were initiated and the default status of the loans we also had the obligation to absorb losses or rights to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie consequently we were the primary beneficiary of this vie and consolidated the shopping center and adjacent building from march 30 2010 to june 29 2011 our investment in the property is included in “assets held for saledisposal” in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010  and the operations of the entity are included in “discontinued operations” for all periods presented 

in conjunction with the refinancing of the loans we reevaluated our status as the primary beneficiary of the vie because the loan is not in default we no longer have those certain rights that give us the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the shopping center our current involvement in the property is solely as the lender on the mortgage loan with protective rights as the lender therefore we are no longer the primary beneficiary and deconsolidated the entity as of 

june 30 2011  the mortgage loan receivable was recorded at its estimated fair value of 119 million  and we recognized a 20 million  gain on deconsolidation as part of the refinancing which is included in “discontinued operations  gain on deconsolidation of vie” for 2011  as of december 31 2011  the loan was performing and the carrying amount of the mortgage loan was 117 million  which is included in “mortgage notes receivable” on the balance sheet this amount also reflects our maximum exposure to loss related to this investment 

the change in design of the entity including the refinancing of the loan was a vie reconsideration event given that the loan is no longer in default we as lender do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and the additional equity investment at risk provided by the entity’s equity holders the entity is no longer a vie 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 our properties are located in densely populated or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities in 2012  we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately 57 million  

additionally we continue to invest in the development at assembly row which is a longterm development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years the carrying value of the development portion of this project at december 31 2011  is approximately 148 million  the project currently has zoning entitlements to build 23 million  square feet of commercialuse buildings 2100  residential units and a 200  room hotel we expect that we will structure any future development in a manner designed to mitigate our risk which may include transfers of entitlements or codeveloping with other companies in december 2011 we entered into agreements with avalonbay communities avalonbay for a portion of the first phase of residential and retail development at assembly row which will include 575 residential units by avalonbay and approximately 323000 square feet of retail space the massachusetts bay transit authority mbta will also construct the new orange line tstop at the property we expect construction on phase 1 to commence in early 2012 with stabilization in 2015 we will also continue our infrastructure work during 2012 we invested 36 million in assembly row in 2011  and expect to invest between 20 million  and 40 million  in 2012  net of expected public funding 

during 2011 we continued our predevelopment work related to the longterm redevelopment of midpike plaza in rockville maryland which will become pike  rose a longterm multiphased mixeduse project the property currently has zoning entitlements to build 17 million square feet of commercialuse buildings and 17 million square feet for residential use phase i of pike  rose involves demolition of roughly 25 of the existing gla at midpike plaza and construction of 493 residential units 151000 square feet of retail space and 79000 square of office space we expect construction of phase i to commence in 2012 with stabilization in 20152016 we invested 7 million in pike  rose in 2011 and expect to invest between 15 million to 35 million in 2012 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide longterm growth opportunities generally our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth however they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt on occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through new or assumed mortgages 

our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates the current economic environment may however impact our ability to increase rental rates in the shortterm and may require us to decrease some rental rates this will have a longterm impact over the contractual term of the lease agreement which on average is between five and ten years we expect to continue to see small changes in occupancy over the short term and expect increases in occupancy to be a driver of our samecenter growth over the long term as we are able to release vacant spaces we seek to maintain a mix of strong 

national regional and local retailers at december 31 2011  no single tenant accounted for more than 25  of annualized base rent 

the current economic environment has impacted the success of certain of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from certain of our tenants while we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base mitigates the negative impact of the economic environment any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we expect our occupancy rate will remain relatively flat in the short term since the latter part of 2010 we have seen signs of improvement for some of our tenants as well as increased interest from prospective tenants for our retail spaces however there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue we continue to monitor our tenants’ operating performances as well as trends in the retail industry to evaluate any future impact 

at december 31 2011  the leasable square feet in our properties was 924  occupied and 934  leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

samecenter 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as discontinued operations

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90  of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses obligations under our capital and operating leases regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this 

conservative structure 

on february 24 2011 we entered into an atm equity program in which we may from time to time offer and sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 3000 million  through december 31 2011  we have issued 1662038  common shares for net cash proceeds of 1393 million  under the program 

on november 22 2011 we entered into a 2750 million  unsecured term loan that matures on november 21 2018  and we have an option to increase the term loan through an accordion feature to 3500 million in addition we entered into two  interest rate swap agreements which effectively fixed the interest rate on the loan at 317  through november 1 2018  

cash and cash equivalents increased 520 million  to 678 million  at december 31 2011  however cash and cash equivalents are not the only indicator of our liquidity we also have a 4000 million  unsecured revolving credit facility which matures on july 6 2015  and had no  outstanding balance at december 31 2011  in addition we have an option to increase the credit facility through an accordion feature to 8000 million  

for 2011  the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 2650 million  the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 1635 million  and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 10  also as of december 31 2011  we had the capacity to issue up to 1583 million  in common shares under our atm equity program we have approximately 192 million of debt maturing in 2012 of which 1750 million relates to our 600 senior notes that matures in july 2012 we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand our atm equity program and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our capital expenditures 

our overall capital requirements during 2012  will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of assembly row pike  rose and future phases of santana row while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to incur higher amounts in 2012 compared to those incurred in 2011 related to capital investments for development redevelopment and existing properties as we progress with our active development pipeline these amounts will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand our revolving credit facility andor shares issued under our atm equity program and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past ability to access the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 summary of cash flows 

  



net cash provided by operating activities decreased 120 million  to 2447 million  during 2011  from 2567 million  during 2010  the decrease was primarily attributable to the 162 million  payment of the final judgment related to a previously disclosed lawsuit offset by higher net income before certain noncash items 

net cash used in investing activities increased 93 million  to 1964 million  during 2011  from 1871 million  during 2010  

the increase was primarily attributable to 

 partially offset by 

 

net cash provided by financing activities increased 1929 million  to 37 million  during 2011  from 1892 million  used in 2010  the increase was primarily attributable to

 in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed the following potential commitments exist 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and after january 1 1986 an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the other minority partner to purchase its 2947  interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value if the other minority partner defaults in their obligation we must purchase the full interest based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2011  our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 54 million  to 64 million  

b under the terms of a partnership which owns a project in southern california if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the property owned by the partnership the other partner may require us to purchase their 10  partnership interest at a formula price based upon property operating income the purchase price for the partnership interest will be paid using our common shares or subject to certain conditions cash if the other partner does not redeem their interest we may choose to purchase the partnership interest upon the same terms 

c under the terms of various other partnership agreements the partners have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2011  a total of 360314  operating partnership units are outstanding

f at december 31 2011  we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 159 million  which are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the trust 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have a joint venture arrangement the “partnership” with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” we own 30  of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70  we hold a general partnership interest however clarion also holds a general partnership interest and has substantive participating rights we cannot make significant decisions without clarion’s approval accordingly we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method as of december 31 2011  the partnership owned seven  retail real estate properties we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest the partnership is subject to a buysell provision which is customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate this provision at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest accounting policies for the partnership are similar to accounting policies followed by the trust at december 31 2011  our investment in the partnership was 344 million  and the partnership had approximately 574 million  of mortgages payable outstanding 

in may 2010 we formed taurus newbury street jv ii limited partnership “newbury street partnership” a joint venture with an affiliate of taurus investment holdings llc “taurus” to acquire operate and redevelop properties located primarily in the back bay section of boston massachusetts we held an 85  limited partnership interest in newbury street partnership and taurus held a 15  limited partnership interest and served as general partner as general partner taurus was responsible for the operation and management of the properties subject to our approval on major decisions we evaluated the entity and determined it was not a vie accordingly given taurus’ role as general partner we accounted for our interest in newbury 

street partnership using the equity method 

on october 31 2011 our newbury street partnership sold its entire portfolio of three  buildings for 440 million  as part of the sale we received 346 million  of the net proceeds which included the repayment of our 118 million  loans due to our earnings being recorded one quarter in arrears we will recognize the gain on sale of 118 million  in the first quarter 2012 

other than the joint venture described above and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2011  that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2011  



 

 our revolving credit facility term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2011  we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within an applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes term loan and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our scheduled principal repayments as of december 31 2011

interest rate hedging 

we may use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet and our consolidated statement of of shareholders equity our cash flow hedges become ineffective if critical terms of the hedging instrument and the debt instrument do not perfectly match such as notional amounts settlement dates reset dates calculation period and libor rate in addition we evaluate the default risk of the counterparty by monitoring the credit worthiness of the counterparty which includes reviewing debt ratings and financial performance however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty if a cash flow hedge is deemed ineffective the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps associated with our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected 

in november 2011 we entered into two  interest rate swap agreements to fix the variable rate portion of our 2750 million  term loan at 172  from december 1 2011  through november 1 2018  the swap agreements effectively fixed the rate on the term loan at 317  both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value hedge ineffectiveness did not impact earnings in 2011 and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future we had no derivative instruments outstanding during 2010 and 2009 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute at least 90  of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

included below is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders as further discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements net income for 2010 and 2009 includes certain charges related to the litigation and appeal process over a parcel of land adjacent to santana row as well as adjusting the accrual for such litigation matter management believes ffo excluding this litigation provision provides a more meaningful evaluation of operations while litigation is not 

unusual we believe the premise of the underlying litigation matter see note 9 for discussion warrants presentation of ffo excluding the related charges 

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders and to ffo available to common shareholders excluding the litigation provision is as follows 



 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes as of december 31 2011  we were party to two  interest rate swap agreements to fix the variable rate portion of our 2750 million  term loan at 172  from december 1 2011  through november 1 2018  

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the 

fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2031 or with respect to capital lease obligations through 2106 have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2011  we had 21 billion  of fixedrate debt outstanding including our 2750 million  term loan as the rate is effectively fixed by two  interest rate swap agreements and 631 million  of capital lease obligations if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2011  had been 10  higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 691 million  if market interest rates used to calculate the fair value on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2011  had been 10  lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 735 million  

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2011  we had 94 million  of variable rate debt outstanding which consisted of municipal bonds our revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance as of december 31 2011  based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 01 million  and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 01 million  conversely if market interest rates decreased 10  our annual interest expense would decrease by less than 01 million  with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and senior vice presidentchief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america this process includes policies and procedures that 

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework  in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation 

generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report and provides reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

 our traditional focus has been and remains on regional community and neighborhood shopping centers that generally are anchored by grocery stores late in 1994 recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance of retailer expansion to main streets we expanded our investment strategy to include street retail and mixeduse properties the mixeduse properties are typically centered around a retail component but may also include office residential andor hotel components 

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

  

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property the current economic conditions may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants we have seen some tenants experiencing declining sales vacating early failing to pay rent on a timely basis or filing for bankruptcy as well as seeking rent relief from us as landlord any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result as a result of the current economic conditions we have seen a decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that file for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owed to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy 

  

general economic conditions or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms which may include decreases in rental rates as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 18 billion of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 5067 million was secured by all or a portion of 21 of our real estate projects and approximately 599 million represented capital lease obligations on three of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 576 million of debt secured by four properties as of december 31 2010 approximately 17 billion 95 of our debt as of december 31 2010 which includes all of our property secured debt and our capital lease obligations is fixed rate debt our joint venture’s debt of 576 million is also fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt 

our revolving credit facility and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not intend to undertake on our own construction of any new largescale mixeduse groundup development projects however we do intend to complete the development and construction of remaining phases of projects we already have started such as santana row in san jose california and assembly row in somerville massachusetts as well as any future redevelopment of midpike plaza in rockville maryland we may undertake development of these and other projects if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

a key component of our development at assembly row is the development of public infrastructure this includes the roads throughout the project as well as the building of a “tstop” which is a stop on the greater boston area’s subway system adjacent to our property while we will contribute significantly to the infrastructure development we also expect to receive substantial public funding for the project the final funding decision and amount however is out of our control and therefore there can be no assurance that we will receive the public funding if we do not receive adequate public funding or necessary government approval for a tstop at the property the project may not provide a justifiable risk adjusted return resulting in a temporary or permanent hold on the project and a writeoff of a portion of the project 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other properties in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all debt could include the sale of debt securities and mortgage loans from third parties while we were able to consummate financings during 2009 and 2010 if economic conditions and conditions in the capital markets are not favorable at the time we need to raise capital we may need to obtain capital on less favorable terms than in recent years for debt financings equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

  

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 18 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2010 approximately 864 million bears interest at variable rates and was unhedged we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders although we have in the past and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions as to all or a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates the amounts we are required to pay under the variable rate debt to which the hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully occupied 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood rental loss and acts of terrorism we also currently carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties in 

  

california and environmental insurance on most of our properties all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt seriously our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed further we may be unable to collect insurance proceeds if our insurers are unable to pay or contest a claim events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets owned jointly with other persons or entities as of december 31 2010 we held three predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons in addition to our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” taurus newbury street jv ii limited partnership “newbury street partnership” and properties owned in a “downreit” structure we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although as of december 31 2010 we held the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments except newbury street partnership we must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

on july 1 2004 we entered into a joint venture with clarion for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 

  

  

   

the terms of our partnership require that certain acquisition opportunities be presented first to the joint venture which limits our ability to acquire properties for our own account which could in turn limit our ability to grow our joint venture with clarion is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate these provisions at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2010 this joint venture owned seven properties 

in addition in may 2010 we formed newbury street partnership a joint venture limited partnership with an affiliate of taurus investment holdings llc “taurus” which plans to acquire operate and redevelop up to 200 million of properties located primarily in the back bay section of boston massachusetts we do not serve as general partner or manager for this joint venture however taurus must obtain our consent for certain major decisions our joint venture with taurus is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry the buysell can be exercised only in certain circumstances through may 2014 and may be initiated by either party at anytime thereafter which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire taurus’ interest as of december 31 2010 newbury street partnership owned two mixeduse buildings on newbury street 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure to properly remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

  

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 

  

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

   

if we do not maintain or increase the dividend on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

  

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in quality retail based properties that are frequently neighborhood and community shopping centers principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors

none 




 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2010 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 85 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 183 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2010 total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 2400 leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 26 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2010 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

  

geographic diversification 

our 85 real estate projects are located in 13 states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area “gla” of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2010 

 

  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2010 represented approximately 41 of total rental income 

  

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2010 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2011 and after 2020 in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2010 

 

   

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2010 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers 

 

   

   

   

   

   

  

             

   


 item 3 legal proceedings 

in may 2003 a breach of contract action was filed against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california san jose division alleging that a one page document entitled “final proposal” constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our santana row property and gave the plaintiff the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in accordance with a formula included in the “final proposal” the “final proposal” explicitly stated that it was subject to approval of the terms and conditions of a formal agreement a trial as to liability only was held in june 2006 and a jury rendered a verdict against us 

a trial on the issue of damages was held in april 2008 and the court issued a tentative ruling in april 2009 awarding damages to the plaintiff of approximately 144 million plus interest accordingly considering all the information available to us when we filed our march 31 2009 form 10q our best estimate of damages interest and other costs was 214 million resulting in an increase in our accrual for this matter of 206 million in june 2009 the court issued a final judgment awarding damages of 159 million including interest plus costs of suit and in july 2009 we and the plaintiff both filed a notice of appeal with the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in december 2009 the plaintiff filed an “appellee’s principal and response brief” providing additional information regarding the issues the plaintiff is appealing given the additional information regarding the appeal we lowered our accrual to 164 million in the fourth quarter 2009 which reflected our best estimate of the litigation liability oral arguments on the appeal were heard in december 2010 a final ruling on the appeal was issued in february 2011 which rejected both appeals and consequently affirmed the final judgment against us therefore in december 2010 we adjusted our accrual to 162 million which reflects the amount we expect to pay in first quarter 2011 

the net change in our accrual in 2010 and 2009 is included in “litigation provision” in our consolidated statements of operations the litigation accrual of 162 million and 164 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively is included in the “accounts payable and accrued expenses” line item in our consolidated balance sheets during 2010 and 2009 we incurred additional legal and other costs related to this lawsuit and appeal process which are also included in the “litigation provision” line item in the consolidated statements of operations

 item 5 market for our common equity and related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

our common shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “frt” listed below are the high and low closing prices of our common shares as reported on the new york stock exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated 

 

 on february 9 2011 there were 3666 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 43 consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2010 and 2009 were 265 per share and 261 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2011 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

  

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

 

 distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2010 and 2009 our allowance for doubtful accounts was 187 million and 161 million respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 04 and 13 of rental income and it was 12 in 2010 reflecting economic changes and their impact to our tenants a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and 

  

we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 53 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2010 and 2009 accounts receivable include approximately 456 million and 418 million respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors a newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings estimating the useful lives of assets that are longlived requires significant management judgment certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation expense will be for that asset in a fiscal period which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

  

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of abovemarket and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis since most of our investments in real estate are whollyowned or controlled assets which are held for use a property with impairment indicators is first tested for impairment by comparing the undiscounted cash flows including residual value to the current net book value of the property if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value the property is written down to expected fair value 

the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable 

  

and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we are party to a litigation matter related to a parcel of land adjacent to our santana row property during 2009 the judge awarded damages to the plaintiff including interest and costs of suit resulting in us increasing our litigation accrual to 164 million we and the plaintiff both appealed the ruling and oral arguments on the appeal were heard in december 2010 a final ruling on the appeal was issued in february 2011 which rejected both appeals and consequently affirmed the final judgment against us therefore in december 2010 we adjusted our accrual to 162 million which reflects the amount we expect to pay in first quarter 2011 

in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a new accounting standard which provides certain changes to the evaluation of a vie including requiring a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and enhanced disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement with a vie under the new standard the primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance of the vie and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie 

we adopted the standard effective january 1 2010 the adoption did not have a material impact to our financial statements the newly required balance sheet disclosures regarding assets and liabilities of a consolidated vie have been parenthetically included in our balance sheet these parenthetical amounts relate to melville mall in huntington new york a shopping center and adjacent commercial building in norwalk connecticut which is further discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k and huntington square in east northport new york which is further discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k although the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact to our financial statements this standard could impact future consolidation of entities based on the specific facts and circumstances of those entities 

  

in july 2010 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that requires enhanced disclosures about financing receivables including the allowance for credit losses credit quality and impaired loans this standard is effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2010 we adopted the standard in the fourth quarter 2010 and it did not have a material impact to our financial statements 

property acquisitions and dispositions 

2010 significant acquisitions 

a summary of our significant acquisitions in 2010 is as follows 

 

  

    2010 assets held for sale 

in december 2010 we committed to a plan of sale for two buildings on fifth avenue in san diego california as the buildings met the criteria to be classified as held for sale we recognized a 04 million loss to write down one of the buildings to its expected sales price less cost to sell we expect the sales will be completed in 2011 the operations of the buildings have been reclassified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all years presented and included in “assets held for sale” in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

2009 significant transactions 

on june 26 2009 one of our tenants acquired from us our fee interest in a land parcel in white marsh maryland that was subject to a longterm ground lease the ground lease included an option for the tenant to purchase the fee interest the sales price was 21 million and resulted in a gain of 04 million 

on october 16 2009 we acquired 166 acres of riverfront property at assembly row in somerville massachusetts for use in future development in exchange for the sale of 124 acres of adjacent inland land 3 million in cash and the assumption of a 5 million liability the purchase price of the riverfront parcel was determined to be 331 million based on current fair value calculations the sale of the inland land resulted in no gain or loss on sale as the fair value of the consideration exchanged equaled the cost basis of the land sold 

2010 significant debt equity and other transactions 

on january 28 2010 we delivered notice exercising our option to extend the maturity date by one year to july 27 2011 on our revolving credit facility which bears interest at libor plus 425 basis points we paid an extension fee of 05 million which is being amortized over the remaining term of the revolving credit facility 

on march 1 2010 we issued 1500 million of fixed rate senior notes that mature on april 1 2020 and bear interest at 590 the net proceeds from this note offering after issuance discounts underwriting fees and other costs were 1485 million 

on various dates from february 25 2010 to march 2 2010 we repaid the remaining 2500 million balance of our term loan the term loan had an original maturity date of july 27 2011 however the loan agreement included an option to prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty due to these repayments approximately 28 million of unamortized debt fees were recorded as additional interest expense in 2010 and are included in “early extinguishment of debt” in the consolidated statement of operations the term loan was repaid using cash on hand and cash from the 1500 million note issuance 

on march 30 2010 we acquired the first mortgage loan on a shopping center located in norwalk connecticut the first mortgage loan bears interest at 725 matures on september 1 2032 and as of december 31 2010 had an outstanding contractual principal balance of 113 million since november 5 2008 we have held the second mortgage on this shopping center and a first mortgage on an adjacent commercial building which had an outstanding balance of 74 million at december 31 2010 all of these loans are currently in default and foreclosure proceedings have been filed 

we reached an agreement with the borrower whereby the borrower would repay the loans by march 29 2011 and are currently in negotiations with the borrower to modify the loans if the loans are not modified or the borrower fails to repay the loans at that time we will be entitled to receive a deedinlieu of foreclosure for both properties if we acquire the properties through exercise of the deedinlieu of foreclosure we believe the fair value of the properties approximates our carrying amount of these loans which are on nonaccrual status 

because the loans are in default we have certain rights under the first mortgage loan agreement that give us the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the shopping center although we are not currently exercising and do not expect to exercise those rights the existence of those rights in the loan agreement results in the entity being a vie additionally given our investment in both the first and second mortgage on the property the overall decline in fair market value since the loans were initiated and the current default status of the loans we also have the obligation to absorb losses or rights to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the vie consequently we have determined we are the primary beneficiary of this vie and consolidated the shopping center and adjacent building as of march 30 2010 therefore our investment in the property of approximately 183 million is included in “real estate” in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2010 

  

in october 2010 donald c wood our chief executive officer was granted 60931 shares of restricted stock valued at approximately 5000000 which will vest on october 12 2015 additionally mr wood’s annual base pay was increased from 700000 to 850000 per year effective november 1 2010 his target bonus was increased from 100 of his base salary to 150 of his base salary beginning with his 2010 bonus and his target amount for potential equity to be issued in february 2011 under our 2010 performance incentive plan as amended “2010 plan” was increased from 20 million to 40 million grants under the 2010 plan generally vest over three to six years 

the compensation committee of the board of trustees determined that these compensation adjustments were prudent consistent with the trust’s compensation philosophy and in the best interest of the trust’s shareholders after considering four primary factors a the appropriate market value for mr wood’s services after retaining a consultant to benchmark comparable real estate companies and make recommendations b the historical outperformance of the company over the last decade in terms of shareholder value creation and the prospects for continued outperformance in the future c the active recruiting for mr wood’s services in the marketplace and the related strong desire to retain him and his senior management team at the trust and d the ability of the current senior management team to take advantage of future opportunities to increase shareholder value 

on december 27 2010 we acquired the fee interest in approximately 21 acres of land under our bethesda row property prior to the transaction we had a capital lease obligation of 10 million on the land parcel which was extinguished as part of the transaction 

formation of joint venture 

in may 2010 we formed taurus newbury street jv ii limited partnership “newbury street partnership” a joint venture limited partnership with an affiliate of taurus investment holdings llc “taurus” which plans to acquire operate and redevelop up to 200 million of properties located primarily in the back bay section of boston massachusetts we hold an 85 limited partnership interest in newbury street partnership and taurus holds a 15 limited partnership interest and serves as general partner as general partner taurus is responsible for the operation and management of the properties subject to our approval on major decisions we have evaluated the entity and determined that it is not a vie accordingly given taurus’ role as general partner we account for our interest in newbury street partnership using the equity method during 2010 we recorded expenses of approximately 02 million related to our share of formation costs of newbury street partnership 

newbury street partnership is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry the buysell can be exercised only in certain circumstances through may 2014 and may be initiated by either party at anytime thereafter which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire taurus’ interest 

on may 26 2010 newbury street partnership acquired the fee interest in two buildings located on newbury street in boston massachusetts for a purchase price of 175 million the properties include approximately 32000 square feet of retail and office space a significant portion of the office space was vacant when the properties were acquired and are currently being leased up we contributed 78 million towards this acquisition and provided an 88 million interestonly loan secured by the two buildings the loan matures in may 2012 subject to a oneyear extension option and bears interest at 30day libor plus 400 basis points all amounts contributed and advanced to newbury street partnership are included in “investment in real estate partnerships” in the consolidated balance sheet intercompany profit generated from interest income on the loan is eliminated in consolidation due to the timing of receiving financial information from the general partner our share of operating earnings is recorded one quarter in arrears during 2010 we recorded approximately 02 million related to our share of acquisition related costs 

  

litigation provision 

in may 2003 a breach of contract action was filed against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california san jose division alleging that a one page document entitled “final proposal” constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our santana row property and gave the plaintiff the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in accordance with a formula included in the “final proposal” the “final proposal” explicitly stated that it was subject to approval of the terms and conditions of a formal agreement a trial as to liability only was held in june 2006 and a jury rendered a verdict against us 

a trial on the issue of damages was held in april 2008 and the court issued a tentative ruling in april 2009 awarding damages to the plaintiff of approximately 144 million plus interest accordingly considering all the information available to us when we filed our march 31 2009 form 10q our best estimate of damages interest and other costs was 214 million resulting in an increase in our accrual for this matter of 206 million in june 2009 the court issued a final judgment awarding damages of 159 million including interest plus costs of suit and in july 2009 we and the plaintiff both filed a notice of appeal with the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit in december 2009 the plaintiff filed an “appellee’s principal and response brief” providing additional information regarding the issues the plaintiff is appealing given the additional information regarding the appeal we lowered our accrual to 164 million in the fourth quarter 2009 which reflected our best estimate of the litigation liability oral arguments on the appeal were heard in december 2010 a final ruling on the appeal was issued in february 2011 which rejected both appeals and consequently affirmed the final judgment against us therefore in december 2010 we adjusted our accrual to 162 million which reflects the amount we expect to pay in first quarter 2011 

the net change in our accrual in 2010 and 2009 is included in “litigation provision” in our consolidated statements of operations the litigation accrual of 162 million and 164 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively is included in the “accounts payable and accrued expenses” line item in our consolidated balance sheets during 2010 and 2009 we incurred additional legal and other costs related to this lawsuit and appeal process which are also included in the “litigation provision” line item in the consolidated statements of operations 

subsequent event 

on january 19 2011 we acquired the fee interest in tower shops located in davie florida for a net purchase price of approximately 661 million which includes the assumption of a mortgage loan of approximately 410 million the mortgage loan bears interest at 652 is interest only until july 2011 at which time it converts to a 30year amortization schedule and matures in july 2015 the loan is prepayable after june 2011 and we expect to repay the loan during 2011 which will include a 3 prepayment premium on the outstanding loan balance the property contains approximately 372000 square feet of gross leasable area and is shadowanchored by home depot and costco 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 

  

  

 our properties are located in densely populated or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these 

  

types of opportunities in 2010 redevelopment projects totaling 27 million stabilized in 2011 and 2012 we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately 48 million and 50 million respectively 

additionally we continue to invest in the development at assembly row which is a longterm development project we expect to be involved in over the coming years the project currently has zoning entitlements to build 23 million square feet of commercialuse buildings 2100 residential units and a 200 room hotel we expect that we will structure any future development in a manner designed to mitigate our risk which may include transfers of entitlements or codeveloping with other real estate companies we have entered into a preliminary agreement with a residential developer for the first phase of development and continue our current predevelopment and infrastructure work we received approximately 10 million in public funding in april 2010 which is included in “notes payable” in the consolidated balance sheet related to the infrastructure work we have completed and we expect the state will complete certain additional infrastructure work using government stimulus funds we incurred approximately 16 million related to the development in 2010 net of the public funding discussed above and expect to incur between 10 million and 30 million in 2011 net of expected public funding 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long term opportunities generally our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth however they provide longterm releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt on occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through assumed or new mortgages 

our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates the current economic environment may however impact our ability to increase rental rates in the shortterm and may require us to decrease some rental rates this will have a longterm impact over the contractual term of the lease agreement which on average is between five and ten years we expect to continue to see small changes in occupancy over the short term and expect increases in occupancy to be a driver of our samecenter growth over the long term as we are able to release these vacant spaces we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2010 no single tenant accounted for more than 26 of annualized base rent 

the current economic environment has impacted the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants since 2008 we have seen tenants experiencing declining sales vacating early or filing for bankruptcy as well as seeking rent relief from us as landlord any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations while we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base mitigates the negative impact of the economic environment we may see an increase in vacancy over the short term that could have a negative impact on our revenue and bad debt expense during the latter part of 2010 we saw positive signs of improvement for some of our tenants as well as increased interest for our retail spaces however there can be no assurance that these positive signs will continue we continue to monitor our tenants’ operating performances as well as trends in the retail industry to evaluate any future impact 

at december 31 2010 the leasable square feet in our properties was 932 occupied and 939 leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that 

  

are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

results of operations 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as discontinued operations

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

in march 2010 we took advantage of lower longterm interest rates and issued 150 million of 10year senior notes at a 590 interest rate using funds from the senior note offering as well as cash on hand we repaid the outstanding 250 million balance on our term loan in advance of it maturing in july 2011 cash and cash equivalents were 158 million at december 31 2010 which is a 1196 million decrease from the 1354 million balance at december 31 2009 the significant decrease is due primarily to the debt transactions discussed above and capital investments during 2010 however cash and cash equivalents are not the only indicator of our liquidity we also have a 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures july 27 2011 which had an outstanding balance of 770 million at december 31 2010 during 2010 the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 820 million the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 234 million and the weighted average interest rate before amortization of debt fees was 07 

during 2011 we have approximately 1123 million of debt maturities related to mortgages payable and senior notes additionally our 300 million revolving credit facility matures in july 2011 we are currently working with lenders to refinance our revolving credit facility and anticipate being able to obtain at least similar levels of commitments under a new facility we expect the interest rate to be higher than our current revolving credit facility consistent with current market rates for similar facilities we currently believe that cash flows from operations cash on hand and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations debt maturities litigation settlement and recurring capital expenditures 

  

our overall capital requirements in 2011 will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of future phases of existing properties while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to incur at least similar levels of capital expenditures in 2011 compared to prior periods which will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor the revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity 

if necessary we may access the debt or equity capital markets to finance significant acquisitions given our past success as well as the status of the capital markets we expect debt or equity to be available to us although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to the conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 

  

 summary of cash flows for 2010 and 2009 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities was 2567 million during 2010 and 2568 million during 2009 the minimal change was primarily attributable to increases in net income before the litigation provision offset by timing of interest payments on our senior notes and term loan as a result of changes in the debt outstanding in 2009 and 2010 and timing of payments related to operating expenses 

net cash used in investing activities increased 597 million to 1871 million during 2010 from 1273 million during 2009 the increase was primarily attributable to

  in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed the following potential commitments exist 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and after january 1 1986 an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between 

  

onehalf to all of its 2947 interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2010 our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 44 million to 51 million

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have a joint venture arrangement “the partnership” with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” we own 30 of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70 we hold a general partnership interest however clarion also holds a general partnership interest and has substantive participating rights we cannot make significant decisions without clarion’s approval accordingly we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method as of december 31 2010 the partnership owned seven retail real estate properties we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest the partnership is subject to a buysell provision which is customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate these provisions at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest at december 31 2010 and 2009 the partnership had 576 million and 578 million respectively of mortgages payable outstanding and our investment in the partnership was 355 million and 356 million respectively 

in may 2010 we formed taurus newbury street jv ii limited partnership “newbury street partnership” a joint venture limited partnership with an affiliate of taurus investment holdings llc “taurus” which plans to acquire operate and redevelop up to 200 million in properties located primarily in the back bay section of boston massachusetts we hold an 85 limited partnership interest in newbury street partnership and taurus holds a 15 limited partnership interest and serves as general partner as general partner taurus is responsible for the operation and management of the properties subject to our approval on major decisions we have evaluated the entity and determined that it is not a vie accordingly given taurus’ role as general partner we account for our interest in newbury street partnership using the equity method the entity is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry the buysell can be exercised only in certain circumstances through may 2014 and may be initiated by either party at anytime thereafter which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire taurus’ interest at december 31 2010 we had invested approximately 167 million in newbury street partnership including an 88 million mortgage loan 

other than the joint venture described above and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2010 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2010 

 

  

   

      our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2010 we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our debt maturities as of december 31 2010 

 

  

  interest rate hedging 

we had no hedging instruments outstanding during 2010 we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

  

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 

  

  

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless it is necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute 90 of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

included below is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders as well as ffo available to common shareholders excluding the litigation provision as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements net income for 2010 and 2009 includes certain charges related to the litigation and appeal process over a parcel of land adjacent to santana row as well as adjusting the accrual for such litigation matter management believes ffo excluding this litigation provision provides a more meaningful evaluation of operations while litigation is not unusual we believe the premise of the underlying litigation matter see note 8 for discussion warrants presentation of ffo excluding the related charges 

  

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows 

 

  

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

as of december 31 2010 we were not party to any open derivative financial instruments we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgage and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2031 or through 2106 including capital lease obligations have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2010 we had 16 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding and 599 million of capital lease obligations if market interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2010 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 672 million if market interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2010 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 717 million 

variable interest rate debt 

generally we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2010 we had 864 million of variable rate debt outstanding which consisted of 770 million outstanding on our revolving credit facility and 94 million of municipal bonds based upon this amount of variable rate debt and the specific terms if market interest rates increased 10 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 09 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 09 million conversely if market interest rates decreased 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 06 million with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our 

  

independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

business objectives and strategies 

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail properties with the most prevalent property type being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers that will 

 

  

  

  

 our traditional focus has been and remains on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers late in 1994 recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance of retailer expansion to main streets we expanded our investment strategy to include mixeduse properties the mixeduse properties are typically centered around a retail component but also include office residential andor hotel components 

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain higher occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our longterm weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth our investments primarily fall into one of the following five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

 investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion and acquisition opportunities we consider such factors as 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 financing strategies 

our financing strategies are designed to enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible our financing strategies include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 employees 

at february 12 2010 we had 239 fulltime employees and 137 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws when we filed our 1962 tax return as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income each year we will be subject to 

  

federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our taxable income we will also generally not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes in 2009 2008 and 2007 our trs incurred net income taxesrefunds of approximately 05 million 08 million and 03 million respectively primarily related to sales of condominiums at santana row sales of three properties in 2007 and our investment in certain restaurant joint ventures at santana row 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

  

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property the current downturn in the economy may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants we have seen some tenants experiencing declining sales vacating early failing to pay rent on a timely basis or filing for bankruptcy as well as seeking rent relief from us as landlord any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges on a timely basis including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the event of default by a tenant we may experience delays and unexpected costs in enforcing our rights as landlord under lease terms which may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result as a result of the current downturn in the economy we have seen a decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces due to recent bankruptcies therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may be unable to collect balances due from tenants that filed for bankruptcy protection 

if a tenant or lease guarantor files for bankruptcy we may not be able to collect all prepetition amounts owed by that party in addition a tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may terminate our lease in which event we would have a general unsecured claim that would likely be for less than the full amount owing to us for the remainder of the lease term which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy the downturn in the economy or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be 

  

released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms which may include decreases in rental rates as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 18 billion of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 5162 million was secured by all or a portion of 21 of our real estate projects and approximately 623 million represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 578 million of debt secured by four properties as of december 31 2009 approximately 15 billion 86 of our debt as of december 31 2009 which includes all of our property secured debt and our capital lease obligations is fixed rate debt our joint venture’s debt of 578 million is also fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt 

our revolving credit facility term loan and certain series of notes include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 

  

   

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not intend to undertake on our own construction of any new largescale mixeduse groundup development projects however we do intend to complete the development and construction of remaining phases of projects we already have started such as santana row in san jose california and assembly square in somerville massachusetts we may undertake development of these and other projects if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis we may also choose to delay completion of a project if market conditions do not allow an appropriate return if conditions arise and we are not able or decide not to complete a project or if the expected cash flows of our project do not exceed the book value an impairment of the project may be required if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of community and neighborhood shopping centers in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all the debt could include mortgage loans from third parties or the sale of debt securities while we were able to consummate financings during 2009 the current poor economic environment and volatility in the capital markets could result in less favorable terms and availability than in recent years for debt financings equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the current poor economic environment we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 18 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2009 approximately 2594 million bears interest at variable rates and was unhedged our term loan bears interest at libor subject to a 15 floor plus 300 basis points we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders although we have in the past and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions as to a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates the amounts we are required to pay under the variable rate debt to which the hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

  

the market value of our debt and equity securities is subject to various factors that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility 

as with other publicly traded securities the market price of our debt and equity securities depends on various factors which may change from time to time andor may be unrelated to our financial condition operating performance or prospects that may cause significant fluctuations or volatility in such prices these factors include among others 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 each of these risks could result in decreases in market rental rates and increases in vacancy rates which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation 

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a 

  

reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or redevelop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully leased 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the current economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood rental loss and acts of terrorism we also currently carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties in california and environmental insurance on most of our properties all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the 

  

capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt seriously our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets jointly with other persons or entities and as of december 31 2009 excluding our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” and properties owned in a “downreit” structure we hold three predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives and that disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the property or the joint venture which may result in litigation or arbitration or some other form of dispute resolution although we hold the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments as of december 31 2009 we must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

in addition on july 1 2004 we entered into a joint venture with clarion for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 

  

  

 the terms of our partnership require that certain acquisition opportunities be presented first to the joint venture which limits our ability to acquire properties for our own account which could in turn limit our ability to grow our joint venture with clarion is subject to a buysell provision which is customary for real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate these provisions at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2009 this joint venture owned seven properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be 

  

required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure properly to remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

  

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the code however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must make generally annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 

  

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive current tax law also allows us to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code during the last half of any taxable year to protect our reit status our 

  

declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend rate on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in neighborhood and community shopping centers principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2009 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 84 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 182 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2009 total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

  

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 2400 leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national and international retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 26 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2009 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 84 real estate projects are located in 13 states and the district of columbia the following table shows the number of projects the gross leasable area of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2009 

 

  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2009 represented approximately 41 of total rental income 

  

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2009 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2010 and after 2019 in the aggregate assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2009 

 

   

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or otherwise controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2009 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in may 2003 a breach of contract action was filed against us alleging that a one page document entitled “final proposal” constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our santana row property and gave the plaintiff the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in accordance with a formula included in the “final proposal” the “final proposal” explicitly stated that it was subject to approval of the terms and conditions of a formal agreement a trial as to liability only was held in june 2006 and a jury rendered a verdict against us a trial on the issue of damages was held in april 2008 and the court issued a tentative ruling in april 2009 awarding damages to the plaintiff of approximately 144 million plus interest 

based on this tentative ruling we estimated interest could range from 21 million to 84 million accordingly considering all the information available to us on may 6 2009 when we filed our form 10q for the three months ended march 31 2009 our best estimate of damages interest and other costs was 214 million 

accordingly we increased our accrual for the matter from 08 million at december 31 2008 to 214 million at march 31 2009 in june 2009 the court issued a final judgment awarding damages of 159 million including interest plus costs of suit in july 2009 we and the plaintiff both filed a notice of appeal the plaintiff also filed reimbursement motions for 21 million of legal fees expert fees and court costs of which 19 million was subsequently denied in december 2009 the plaintiff filed an “appellee’s principal and response brief” providing additional information regarding the issues the plaintiff is appealing the plaintiff’s appeal included only the denial of expert fees which totals approximately 04 million given the additional information regarding the appeal we lowered our accrual to 164 million which reflects our best estimate of the litigation liability the net increase in our accrual of 156 million is included in “litigation provision” in our consolidated statement of operations and the 164 million accrual is included in the “accounts payable and accrued expenses” line item in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 during 2009 we incurred additional legal and other costs related to this lawsuit and appeal process which are also included in the “litigation provision” line item in the consolidated statement of operations 

we expect oral arguments on the appeal to be scheduled for later in 2010 all judgments will be stayed until completion of the appeals furthermore we continue to believe that the “final proposal” which included express language that it was subject to formal documentation was not a binding contract and that we should have no liability whatsoever and will vigorously defend our position as part of the appeal process 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of shareholders 

no matters were submitted to a vote of our shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december 31 2009

 item 5 market for our common equity and related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities tableend our common shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “frt” listed below are the high and low closing prices of our common shares as reported on the new york stock exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated 

 

 on february 12 2010 there were 3925 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 42 consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2009 and 2008 were 261 per share and 248 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2010 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under section 857b3 of the code to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are generally taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

  

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

 

 distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 

recent sales of unregistered shares 

under the terms of various operating partnership agreements of certain of our affiliated limited partnerships the interest of limited partners in those limited partnerships may be redeemed subject to certain conditions for cash or an equivalent number of our common shares at our option during the three months ended december 31 2009 there were no operating partnership unit redemptions all other equity securities sold by us during 2009 that were not registered have been previously reported in a quarterly report on form 10q 

purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers 

no equity securities were purchased by us during 2009 however 1495 restricted common shares were forfeited by former employees 

  




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership management and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the midatlantic and northeast regions of the united states as well as in california as of december 31 2009 we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 84 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 182 million square feet in total the real estate projects were 945 leased and 932 occupied at december 31 2009 a joint venture in which we own a 30 interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 10 million square feet as of december 31 2009 in total the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 850 leased and occupied at december 31 2009 we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 42 consecutive years 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america referred to as “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and 

  

liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements however the most critical accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

current accounts receivable from tenants primarily relate to contractual minimum rent and percentage rent as well as real estate tax and other cost reimbursements accounts receivable from straightline rent is typically longer term in nature and relates to the cumulative amount by which straightline rental income recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the contractual lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectability of our current accounts receivable and straightline rents receivable which requires significant judgment by management the collectability of receivables is affected by numerous different factors including current economic conditions bankruptcies and the ability of the tenant to perform under the terms of their lease agreement while we make estimates of potentially uncollectible amounts and provide an allowance for them through bad debt expense actual collectability could differ from those estimates which could affect our net income with respect to the allowance for current uncollectible tenant receivables we assess the collectability of outstanding receivables by evaluating such factors as nature and age of the receivable past history and current financial condition of the specific tenant including our assessment of the tenant’s ability to meet its contractual lease obligations and the status of any pending disputes or lease negotiations with the tenant at december 31 2009 and 2008 our allowance for doubtful accounts was 161 million and 118 million respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 04 and 13 of rental income and it was 12 in 2009 reflecting economic changes and their impact to our tenants a change in the estimate of collectability of a receivable would result in a change to our allowance for doubtful accounts and correspondingly bad debt expense and net income for example in the event our estimates were not accurate and we were required to increase our allowance by 1 of rental income our bad debt expense would have increased and our net income would have decreased by 51 million 

due to the nature of the accounts receivable from straightline rents the collection period of these amounts typically extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a portion of the 

  

amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2009 and 2008 accounts receivable include approximately 418 million and 372 million respectively related to straightline rents correspondingly these estimates of collectability have a direct impact on our net income 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them on a straightline basis in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors a newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings estimating the useful lives of assets that are longlived requires significant management judgment certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation charged to that asset in a fiscal period will be which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is writtenoff if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value additionally we make estimates as to the probability of certain development and redevelopment projects being completed if we determine the redevelopment is no longer probable of completion we immediately expense all capitalized costs which are not recoverable 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in determining whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

  

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of abovemarket and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations if the value of below market lease intangibles includes renewal option periods we include such renewal periods in the amortization period utilized if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets and impairment 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or redeveloped and our investment in certain joint ventures management’s evaluation of impairment includes review for possible indicators of impairment as well as in certain circumstances undiscounted and discounted cash flow analysis the calculation of both discounted and undiscounted cash flows requires management to make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over long periods because our properties typically have a long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters we accrue a liability for litigation if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated if an unfavorable outcome is probable and a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range we accrue the best estimate within the range however if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum within the range is accrued any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income 

as further discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements we are party to a litigation matter related to a parcel of land adjacent to our santana row property during 2009 the judge awarded damages to the plaintiff including interest and costs of suit resulting in us increasing our litigation accrual to 164 million we and the plaintiff are both appealing the ruling and expect oral arguments on the appeal to be scheduled for later in 2010 a change in the final ruling in our favor as part of the appeals process could result in a decrease to our litigation liability which would increase net income however an adverse change during the appeals process could result in an increase to the litigation accrual which would decrease our net income 

  

in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that warranty reserves are understated we will accrue additional reserves at such time a liability has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated warranty reserves are released once the legal liability period has expired or all related work has been substantially completed any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income 

new accounting pronouncements 

fasb accounting standards codification 

in june 2009 the fasb issued new accounting requirements which make the fasb accounting standards codification “codification” the single source of authoritative literature for us accounting and reporting standards the codification is not meant to change existing gaap but rather provide a single source for all literature we adopted the standard during the quarter ended september 30 2009 which required us to change certain disclosures in our financial statements to reflect codification or “plain english” references rather than references to fasb statements staff positions or emerging issues task force abstracts the adoption of this requirement impacted certain disclosures in the financial statements but did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard that broadens and clarifies the definition of a business which will result in significantly more of our acquisitions being treated as business combinations rather than asset acquisitions the new requirement is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 and therefore will only impact prospective acquisitions with no change to the accounting for acquisitions completed prior to or on december 31 2008 the new standard requires us to expense all acquisition related transaction costs as incurred which could include broker fees transfer taxes legal accounting valuation and other professional and consulting fees for acquisitions prior to january 1 2009 these costs were capitalized as part of the acquisition cost while the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements for 2009 the impact to our future consolidated financial statements will vary significantly depending on the timing and number of acquisitions or potential acquisitions size of the acquisitions and location of the acquisitions based on acquisitions in the past several years transaction costs for single asset acquisitions typically ranged from 01 million to 10 million with significantly higher transaction costs for an acquisition of a larger portfolio the new standard includes several other changes to the accounting for business combinations including requiring contingent consideration to be measured at fair value at acquisition and subsequently remeasured through the income statement if accounted for as a liability as the fair value changes any adjustments during the purchase price allocation period to be “pushed back” to the acquisition date with prior periods being adjusted for any changes and the business combination to be accounted for on the acquisition date or the date control is obtained during 2008 we expensed all acquisition related costs for acquisitions which did not close prior to december 31 2008 

  

effective january 1 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard that significantly changes the accounting and reporting of minority interests in the consolidated financial statements and requires a noncontrolling interest which was previously referred to as a minority interest to be recognized as a component of equity rather than included in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet where it was previously presented on january 1 2009 we reclassified 324 million from the mezzanine section of the balance sheet to shareholders’ equity the terminology “minority interest” has been changed to “noncontrolling interest” the “minority interest” caption on the statement of operations is now reflected as “net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” and shown after consolidated net income this is a presentation only change for minority interest on both the balance sheet and statement of operations and has no impact to total liabilities and shareholders’ equity net income available to common shareholders or earnings per share the statement also requires the recognition of 100 of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions of less than 100 controlling interest with subsequent acquisitions of the noncontrolling interest recorded as equity transactions the new accounting standard was adopted effective january 1 2009 and has been applied prospectively except for the presentation changes to the balance sheet and statement of operations which have been applied retrospectively in the 2008 and 2007 consolidated financial statements while there was no additional impact on the consolidated financial statements during 2009 the impact on our future consolidated financial statements will vary depending on the level of transactions with entities involving noncontrolling interests 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard that requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as we currently have no derivative instruments outstanding 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard that defines unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends whether paid or unpaid as participating securities that should be included in the computation of eps pursuant to the twoclass method as part of our stock based compensation program we issue restricted shares which typically vest over a three to six year period these shares have nonforfeitable rights to dividends immediately after issuance prior to january 1 2009 we excluded the unvested shares from the basic eps calculation and included them using the treasury stock method in diluted eps effective january 1 2009 we adopted the new accounting standard and have calculated eps for all periods presented under the twoclass method the twoclass method is an earnings allocation methodology whereby eps for each class of common stock and participating securities is calculated according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings the implementation did not result in a significant change to basic or diluted eps for all periods presented 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard which clarifies the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments the new accounting standard clarifies that equity method investments should initially be measured at cost the issuance of shares by the investee would result in a gain or loss on issuance of shares reflected in the income statement of the equity investor and that a loss in value of an equity investment which is other than a temporary decline should be recognized the standard was effective on a prospective basis beginning on january 1 2009 and did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

during the quarter ended june 30 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard which requires disclosure regarding the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods the adoption resulted in additional disclosures in our quarterly financial statements 

during the quarter ended june 30 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued and requires disclosure of the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated we have added disclosure in note 1 under “principles of consolidation and estimates” to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k regarding the date through which we have evaluated subsequent events 

  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard which provides certain changes to the evaluation of a vie including requiring a qualitative rather than quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a vie continuous assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and enhanced disclosures about an enterprise’s involvement with a vie the standard is effective january 1 2010 and is applicable to all entities in which an enterprise has a variable interest we are currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 

property acquisitions and dispositions 

2009 significant transactions 

on june 26 2009 one of our tenants acquired from us our fee interest in a land parcel in white marsh maryland that was subject to a longterm ground lease the ground lease included an option for the tenant to purchase the fee interest the sales price was 21 million and resulted in a gain of 04 million 

on october 16 2009 we acquired 166 acres of riverfront property at assembly square in somerville massachusetts for use in future development in exchange for the sale of 124 acres of adjacent inland land 3 million in cash and the assumption of a 5 million liability the purchase price of the riverfront parcel was determined to be 331 million based on current fair value calculations the sale of the inland land resulted in no gain or loss on sale as the fair value of the consideration exchanged equaled the cost basis of the land sold the land we acquired is included in “construction–inprogress” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 and the historical basis in the land we sold in 2009 is classified as “assets held for sale” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 

2008 significant transactions 

a summary of our significant acquisitions in 2008 is as follows 

 

  

   

a summary of our significant dispositions in 2008 is as follows 

 

  

   in 2005 and 2006 warranty reserves for condominium units sold at santana row were established to cover potential costs for materials labor and other items associated with warrantytype claims that may arise within the tenyear statutorily mandated latent construction defect warranty period in 2006 and 2007 we increased our warranty reserves by 25 million and 51 million respectively net of taxes related to defective work done by third party contractors while upgrades were made to certain units being prepared for sale during 2007 and 2008 we evaluated the potentially affected units and as of december 31 2008 have substantially completed the inspections and repairs the extent of the damages encountered in the units and the resulting costs to repair varied considerably amongst the units as a result we have adjusted the warranty reserve to reflect the actual costs incurred related to these issues which is approximately 24 million net of 15 million of taxes the change in the reserve of 52 million is included in “gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations” in 2008 these amounts do not reflect any amounts we may recover in the future from insurance or the contractors responsible for the defective work due to the inherent uncertainty related to the recovery from insurance or the contractor we are unable to estimate an expected recovery any recovery will be reflected in our financial statements once the amount is determinable considered probable and collectible 

litigation provision 

in may 2003 a breach of contract action was filed against us alleging that a one page document entitled “final proposal” constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our santana row property and gave the plaintiff the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in accordance with a formula included in the “final proposal” the “final proposal” explicitly stated that it was subject to approval of the terms and conditions of a formal agreement a trial as to liability only was held in june 2006 and a jury rendered a verdict against us a trial on the issue of damages was held in april 2008 and the court issued a tentative ruling in april 2009 awarding damages to the plaintiff of approximately 144 million plus interest 

based on this tentative ruling we estimated interest could range from 21 million to 84 million accordingly considering all the information available to us on may 6 2009 when we filed our form 10q for the three months ended march 31 2009 our best estimate of damages interest and other costs was 214 million 

accordingly we increased our accrual for the matter from 08 million at december 31 2008 to 214 million at march 31 2009 in june 2009 the court issued a final judgment awarding damages of 159 million including 

  

interest plus costs of suit in july 2009 we and the plaintiff both filed a notice of appeal the plaintiff also filed reimbursement motions for 21 million of legal fees expert fees and court costs of which 19 million was subsequently denied in december 2009 the plaintiff filed an “appellee’s principal and response brief” providing additional information regarding the issues the plaintiff is appealing the plaintiff’s appeal included only the denial of expert fees which totals approximately 04 million given the additional information regarding the appeal we lowered our accrual to 164 million which reflects our best estimate of the litigation liability the net increase in our accrual of 156 million is included in “litigation provision” in our consolidated statement of operations and the 164 million accrual is included in the “accounts payable and accrued expenses” line item in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2009 during 2009 we incurred additional legal and other costs related to this lawsuit and appeal process which are also included in the “litigation provision” line item in the consolidated statement of operations 

we expect oral arguments on the appeal to be scheduled for later in 2010 all judgments will be stayed until completion of the appeals furthermore we continue to believe that the “final proposal” which included express language that it was subject to formal documentation was not a binding contract and that we should have no liability whatsoever and will vigorously defend our position as part of the appeal process 

2009 significant debt and equity transactions 

on january 5 2009 we repaid the 44 million mortgage loan on a small portion of mercer mall which had an original maturity date of april 1 2009 this loan was repaid with funds borrowed on our 300 million revolving credit facility

also on june 4 2009 we completed a cash tender offer for our 875 senior notes due december 1 2009 

approximately 403 million of notes were purchased and retired at a 2 premium to par value resulting in a net loss on early extinguishment of approximately 10 million including costs of the transaction this amount is included in “early extinguishment of debt” in the consolidated statement of operations the notes were repaid with funds from our term loan 

on august 13 2009 we issued 1500 million of fixed rate senior notes that mature on august 15 2014 and bear interest at 595 the net proceeds from this note offering after issuance discounts underwriting fees and other costs were 1475 million 

on august 14 2009 we issued 20 million common shares at 5750 per share for cash proceeds of approximately 1100 million net of expenses of the offering 

on october 27 2009 and december 21 2009 we repaid 100 million and 22 million respectively of our term loan the term loan has an original maturity date of july 27 2011 however the loan agreement includes an 

  

option to prepay the loan in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty due to these repayments approximately 17 million of unamortized debt fees were recorded as additional interest expense in 2009 and are included in “early extinguishment of debt” in the consolidated statement of operations the term loan was partially repaid using available cash from the 2009 debt and equity issuances 

on december 1 2009 we repaid the remaining 1236 million of our 875 senior notes on its original maturity date using available cash from the 2009 debt financings 

also on december 1 2009 we repaid our 30 share of two mortgage loans of our partnership with a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners our share of the repayment was 70 million or 234 million in total on the mortgage loans for two properties 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 

  

  

 our properties are located in densely populated or affluent areas with high barriers to entry which allow us to take advantage of redevelopment opportunities that enhance our operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration andor retenanting we evaluate our properties on an ongoing basis to identify these types of opportunities and believe that the decrease in occupancy we have experienced beginning in 2008 as a result of the economic recession will provide future redevelopment opportunities that may not otherwise have been available in 2010 and 2011 we expect to have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately 28 million and 53 million respectively 

additionally in october 2009 we completed a land exchange at assembly square whereby we now own 166 acres of fully entitled riverfront property for the proposed development of assembly square the development at assembly square is a longterm development project which we expect to be involved in over the coming years the project currently has zoning entitlements to add 23 million square feet of commercialuse buildings 2100 residential units and a 200 room hotel we expect that we will structure any future development in a manner designed to mitigate our risk which may include selling entitlements or codeveloping with other real estate companies beginning in 2009 and continuing into 2010 we will be completing certain infrastructure work as well as continuing our current predevelopment work we expect to receive approximately 10 million in public funding related to the infrastructure work we are completing and we expect the state will complete certain additional infrastructure work using government stimulus funds we expect to incur between 10 million and 30 million related to the development in 2010 net of expected bond proceeds 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long term opportunities generally our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth however they provide long term releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash andor borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt on occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common shares preferred shares or downreit units as well as through the assumption of mortgages 

  

our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals and changes in portfolio occupancy over the longterm the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates the current economic environment may however impact our ability to increase rental rates in the shortterm and may require us to decrease some rental rates in the shortterm this will have a longterm impact over the contractual term of the lease agreement which on average is between five and ten years as a result of the current economic environment occupancy declined 11 during 2009 we expect to continue to see small changes in occupancy over the short term and expect increases in occupancy to be a driver of our samecenter growth over the long term as we are able to release these vacant spaces we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2009 no single tenant accounted for more than 26 of annualized base rent 

the current downturn in the economy may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants we have seen tenants experiencing declining sales vacating early or filing for bankruptcy as well as seeking rent relief from us as landlord any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations further our ability to release vacant spaces may be negatively impacted by the current economic environment while we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base should mitigate the negative impact of the economic environment we may continue to see an increase in vacancy that will have a negative impact on our revenue and bad debt expense we continue to monitor our tenants’ operating performances as well as trends in the retail industry to evaluate any future impact 

at december 31 2009 the leasable square feet in our properties was 932 occupied and 945 leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies

the gain on sale of real estate from discontinued operations of 948 million for 2007 is due to a 1002 million gain primarily related to the sales of bath shopping center key road plaza riverside plaza two properties in forest hills and allwood blue star brunswick clifton hamilton and rutgers shopping centers partially offset by a 51 million increase in the reserve net of taxes for the reassessment of damages in 2007 of defective work completed when making upgrades to certain condominiums sold in 2005 and 2006 at santana row 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we typically generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

during 2009 in an effort to ensure availability and provide additional flexibility with our shortterm capital needs we entered into certain financing arrangements in advance of our 2009 debt maturing in may and june 2009 we refinanced our then existing 200 million term loan with a 372 million term loan and also entered into two separate mortgage financing agreements collateralized by five of our properties for total funds of 1631 million we utilized these funds to repay our 200 million term loan the 135 million outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and approximately 1639 million of our 875 senior notes due december 1 2009 additionally in august 2009 we issued 1500 million in fiveyear senior notes which bear interest at 595 and 20 million common shares for combined net cash proceeds of approximately 2575 million as the financings completed in the second quarter 2009 provided adequate capital to fund 2009 debt maturities the proceeds from the debt and equity offerings in august 2009 are expected to be used to fund potential acquisition opportunities fund our redevelopment pipeline reduce amounts outstanding on our term loan and for general corporate purposes in the fourth quarter of 2009 we used a portion of the proceeds to repay 122 million of our term loan the remaining funds from both the second quarter 2009 and august 2009 transactions are being invested on a shortterm basis in money market and other highly liquid investments while we evaluate the current market environment and the best use for the proceeds 

due to the refinancing of our maturing debt several months in advance of the maturity as well as additional financings in august 2009 we incurred and will continue to incur additional interest expense due to higher interest rates on such debt and due to a temporary increase in our debt outstanding until we were able to use the proceeds to retire maturing debt in december 2009 or are able to invest in other long term projects we currently believe that cash flows from operations secured and unsecured debt financings the august 2009 equity offering and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our capital expenditures at december 31 2009 we have no scheduled debt maturities until 2011 

  

our overall capital requirements in 2010 will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of future phases of existing properties while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to incur similar levels of capital expenditures in 2010 compared to prior periods which will be funded on a shortterm basis with cash flow from operations cash on hand andor the revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longterm debt or equity although there is no intent at this time if market conditions deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to the volatile conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 

  

 cash and cash equivalents were 1354 million at december 31 2009 which is a 1202 million increase from the 152 million balance at december 31 2008 the significant increase is due to the cash proceeds from financings and the equity offering discussed above we also have a 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures july 27 2011 of which we had no outstanding balance at december 31 2009 during 2009 the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 1725 million and the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 477 million we expect to continue to utilize cash and our revolving credit facility to fund shortterm operating needs including capital expenditures and acquisitions 

summary of cash flows for 2009 and 2008 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities increased 285 million to 2568 million during the year ended december 31 2009 from 2283 million during the year ended december 31 2008 the increase was primarily attributable to a 215 million increase in cash provided by operating activities due primarily to higher accounts payable and accrued expenses balances and lower accounts receivable balances as well as 70 million higher net income before noncash expenses which includes gain on sale of real estate litigation provision and depreciation and amortization 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 802 million to 1273 million during the year ended december 31 2009 from 2076 million during the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily attributable to

 contractual commitments 

the following table provides a summary of our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

  

   

 in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above and other liquidity requirements previously discussed the following potential commitments exist 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and after january 1 1986 an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between onehalf to all of its 2947 interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2009 our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 38 million to 44 million 

b under the terms of one other partnership which owns a project in southern california if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the property owned by the partnership the other partner may require us to purchase their 10 partnership interest at a formula price based upon property operating income the purchase price for the partnership interest will be paid using our common shares or subject to certain conditions cash if the other partner does not redeem their interest we may choose to purchase the partnership interest upon the same terms 

c under the terms of various other partnership agreements the partners have the right to exchange their operating units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2009 a total of 371260 operating units are outstanding 

d at december 31 2009 we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 107 million which are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the trust 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have a joint venture arrangement the “partnership” with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” we own 30 of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70 we hold a general partnership interest however clarion has substantive participating rights and we cannot make significant decisions without clarion’s approval accordingly we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method as of december 31 2009 the partnership owned seven retail real estate properties we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest the partnership is subject to a buysell provision which is customary in real estate joint venture agreements and the industry either partner may initiate these provisions at any time which could result in either the sale of our interest or the use of available cash or borrowings to acquire clarion’s interest at december 31 2009 and 2008 the partnership had 578 million and 814 million respectively of mortgages payable outstanding and our investment in the partnership was 356 million and 293 million respectively 

other than the joint venture described above and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2009 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2009 

 

  

   

      our revolving credit facility term loan and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our revolving credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a default under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our debt maturities as of december 31 2009 

 

  

  interest rate hedging 

we had no hedging instruments outstanding during 2009 we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 

  

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 

  

  

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless it is necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute 90 of our taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

effective january 1 2009 we adopted a new accounting standard which requires us to calculate ffo per share for all periods presented using the twoclass method the twoclass method is an earnings allocation methodology whereby eps for each class of common stock and participating securities is calculated according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings the implementation resulted in a decrease from 387 to 385 in ffo per share for 2008 and a decrease from 363 to 362 in ffo per share for 2007 

  

the reconciliation of net income to ffo available for common shareholders is as follows 

 

  

    




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

as of december 31 2009 we were not party to any open derivative financial instruments we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2031 or through 2106 including capital lease obligations have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2009 we had 15 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2009 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 614 million if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2009 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 654 million 

variable interest rate debt 

we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2009 we had 2594 million of variable rate debt outstanding which consisted of a 250 million term loan that bears interest at libor subject to a 15 floor plus 300 basis points and 94 million of municipal bonds that bears interest at 04 based upon this amount of variable rate debt and specific terms if interest rates increased by 10 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 26 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 26 million conversely if interest rates decreased by 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by less than 01 million with a corresponding increase in our net income and cash flows for the year

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our 

  

independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure

general 

we are an equity real estate investment trust “reit” specializing in the ownership management development and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategically selected metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as in california as of december 31 2008 we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 84 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 181 million square feet in total the real estate projects were 950 leased and 943 occupied at december 31 2008 a joint venture in which we own a 30 interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 10 million square feet as of december 31 2008 in total the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 974 leased and occupied at december 31 2008 we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 41 consecutive years 

we were founded in 1962 as a real estate investment trust under the laws of the district of columbia and reformed as a real estate investment trust in the state of maryland in 1999 our principal executive offices are located at 1626 east jefferson street rockville maryland 20852 and our telephone number is 301 9988100 our web site address is wwwfederalrealtycom  the information contained on our website is not a part of this report 

business objectives and strategies 

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail properties with the dominant property type being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers that will 

 

  

  

  

 our traditional focus has been and remains on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers late in 1994 recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance of retailer expansion to main streets we expanded our investment strategy to include “street retail” and “mixeduse” properties the mixeduse properties are typically centered around a retail component but also include office residential andor hotel components 

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country in addition because of the infill nature of our locations our properties generally face less competition per capita than properties owned by our peers these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

 investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth 

our investments primarily fall into one of the following five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

 investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion and acquisition opportunities we consider such factors as 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 financing strategies 

our financing strategies are designed to enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible our financing strategies include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 employees 

at february 24 2009 we had 276 fulltime employees and 133 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 1962 as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on reit taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements 

  

including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of reit taxable income we will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed reit taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes in 2008 2007 and 2006 our trs incurred approximately 08 million 15 million and 24 million respectively of income taxes primarily related to sales of condominiums at santana row sales of three properties in 2007 and our investment in certain restaurant joint ventures at santana row 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for such contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

  

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the securities and exchange commission which we refer to as the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and generally provide for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property the current downturn in the economy may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants we have seen tenants experiencing declining sales vacating early or filing for bankruptcy as well as seeking rent relief from us as landlord any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result as a result of the current downturn in the economy we have seen a decrease in the number of tenants available to fill anchor spaces due to the recent bankruptcies therefore tenant demand for certain of our anchor spaces may decrease and as a result we may in certain categories see an increase in vacancy andor a decrease in rents for those spaces that could have a negative impact to our net income 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 17 billion of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 3653 million was secured by 17 of our properties and approximately 635 million represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 

  

814 million of debt secured by six properties as of december 31 2008 approximately 14 billion 81 of our debt as of december 31 2008 which includes all of our property secured debt and our capital lease obligations is fixed rate debt our joint venture’s debt of 814 million is also fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants pursuant to our debt obligations that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt 

our credit facility and term loans include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately 

  

begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not intend to undertake on our own construction of any new largescale mixeduse groundup development projects however we do intend to complete the development and construction of remaining phases of projects we already have started such as santana row in san jose california we may undertake development of these and other projects if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of community and neighborhood shopping centers in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all the debt could include mortgage loans from third parties or the sale of debt securities the current recession and dislocation in the capital markets however has resulted in less favorable terms and availability than in recent years for debt financings equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors as well as the impact of the current recession we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 17 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2008 approximately 3329 million bears interest at variable rates and was unhedged we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders although we have in the past and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions as to a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates the amounts we are required to pay under the variable rate debt to which the hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost andor timing of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or develop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully leased 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions including being unable to sell a property at a return we believe is appropriate due to the current economic environment our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood rental loss and acts of terrorism we also currently carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties in california and environmental insurance on most of our properties all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of 

  

similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt seriously our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets jointly with other persons or entities and as of december 31 2008 excluding our joint venture with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” and properties owned in a “downreit” structure we hold three predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals and that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives although we hold the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments as of december 31 2008 we must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

in addition on july 1 2004 we entered into a joint venture with clarion for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 

  

  

 the terms of our partnership require that certain acquisition opportunities be presented first to the joint venture which limits our ability to acquire properties for our own account which could in turn limit our ability to grow our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2008 this joint venture owned seven properties 

  

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure properly to remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws or regulations also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all laws and regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

  

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and certain other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must make generally annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed reit taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 

  

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on terms we might otherwise find unfavorable and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive alternatively if we are unable to borrow funds at acceptable terms we could choose to pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one 

  

shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding capital stock if that happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend rate on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in neighborhood and community shopping centers principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2008 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 84 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 181 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the 

  

united states as well as california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2008 total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 2450 leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 26 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2008 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any one recent or future bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant however multiple filings by a number of retailers could have a significant impact 

geographic diversification 

our 84 real estate projects are located in 13 states and the district of columbia the following table shows by region and state within the region the number of projects the gross leasable area of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2008 

 

  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases generally reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index 

  

adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2008 represented approximately 37 of total rental income 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2008 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2009 and after 2018 in the aggregate in both cases assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2008 

 

   

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2008 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in may 2003 first national mortgage company filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california the complaint alleged that a one page document entitled “final proposal” which included language that it was subject to approval of formal documentation constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our santana row property and gave first national mortgage company the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in accordance with a formula included in the “final proposal” a trial as to liability only was held in june 2006 and a jury rendered a verdict against us a trial on the issue of damages was held in april 2008 however the judge has not yet issued a ruling reports from our experts and the plaintiff’s experts show potential damages ranging from 600000 to 24 million pending the judge’s ruling we cannot make a reasonable estimate of potential damages we will evaluate whether to appeal the jury verdict after the judge issues his ruling on damages taking into account a variety of factors including the amount of damages awarded if we choose not to appeal or we appeal and are not successful in overturning the jury verdict we will be liable for damages depending on the amount of damages awarded it is possible there could be a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in which it becomes both probable that we will have to pay the damages and such damages can be reasonably estimated in any event management does not believe this matter will have a material impact on our financial position 

we are also involved in a litigation matter relating to a shopping center in new jersey where a former tenant has alleged that we and our management agent acted improperly by failing to disclose a condemnation action at the property that was pending when the lease was signed a trial as to liability only was concluded in april 2007 and in may 2008 a judgment was entered that ruled in our favor on certain legal issues and against us on other legal issues in december 2008 we reached a settlement with the plaintiff of those matters where the court ruled against us and determined that we are liable the total settlement was 23 million of which we paid 115 million and the third party management agent paid 115 million we are currently in the process of settling the amount of the portion of the plaintiff’s legal fees which we are required to pay we expect the amount to be approximately 10 million of which we will pay 50 and the third party management agent will pay 50 our share of the total estimated settlement of 16 million is included in “general and administrative expense” in the statement of operations 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of shareholders 

no matters were submitted to a vote of our shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december 31 2008

 on february 24 2009 there were 4115 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our reit taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 41 consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2008 and 2007 were 2480 per share and 2335 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2009 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under code sec 857b3 to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

  

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

 

 distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 

recent sales of unregistered shares 

under the terms of various operating partnership agreements of certain of our affiliated limited partnerships the interest of limited partners in those limited partnerships may be redeemed subject to certain conditions for cash or an equivalent number of our common shares at our option during the three months ended december 31 2008 3000 operating partnership units were redeemed for cash all other equity securities sold by us during 2008 that were not registered have been previously reported in a quarterly report on form 10q 

purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers 

no equity securities were purchased by us during 2008 however 13961 common shares were placed into treasury as a result of restricted shares forfeited by former employees 

  




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership management development and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties as of december 31 2008 we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 84 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 181 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the midatlantic and northeast regions of the united states as well as in california in total the real estate projects were 950 leased and 943 occupied at december 31 2008 a joint venture in which we own a 30 interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 10 million square feet as of december 31 2008 in total the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 974 leased and occupied at december 31 2008 we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 41 consecutive years 

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which we refer to as gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in 

  

certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

the most significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

our leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk percentage rents which represent additional rents based upon the level of sales achieved by certain tenants are recognized at the end of the lease year or earlier if we have determined the required sales level is achieved and the percentage rents are collectible real estate tax and other cost reimbursements are recognized on an accrual basis over the periods in which the related expenditures are incurred for a tenant to terminate its lease agreement prior to the end of the agreed term we may require that they pay a fee to cancel the lease agreement lease termination fees for which the tenant has relinquished control of the space are generally recognized on the termination date when a lease is terminated early but the tenant continues to control the space under a modified lease agreement the lease termination fee is generally recognized evenly over the remaining term of the modified lease agreement 

we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to minimum rents straightline rents expense reimbursements and other revenue or income in some cases primarily relating to straightline rents the collection of these amounts extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a certain portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2008 and 2007 accounts receivable include approximately 372 million and 320 million respectively related to straightline rents these estimates have a direct impact on our net income 

at december 31 2008 and 2007 our allowance for doubtful accounts was 118 million and 70 million respectively historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 04 and 14 of rental income and it was 12 in 2008 an increase in our bad debt expense would decrease our net income for example if we had experienced an increase in bad debt of 05 of rental income in 2008 our net income would have been reduced by approximately 25 million 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate 

  

investments and depreciate them in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives the cost of our real estate investments less salvage value if any is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the asset using straightline rates for financial statement purposes we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors a newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings estimating the useful lives of assets that are longlived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation charged to that asset in a fiscal period will be which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and major improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to operating expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced or has no future value 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of sfas no 13 these estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of abovemarket and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with 

  

sfas no 141 “business combinations” based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities the value allocated to inplace leases is amortized over the related lease term and reflected as rental income in the statement of operations if a tenant vacates its space prior to contractual termination of its lease the unamortized balance of any inplace lease value is written off to rental income 

longlived assets 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or developed management must evaluate properties for possible impairment of value and for those properties where impairment may be indicated make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over very long periods because our properties typically have a very long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” requires the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity as a result the sale of a property or the classification of a property as held for sale typically requires us to reclassify the revenues and expenses associated with the property from continuing operations to “discontinued operations” for all periods presented 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters 

any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuarial analysis and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements except for sharebased payments under sfas no 123r we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually effective january 1 2008 the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows in accordance with the fasb staff position “fsp” sfas no 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 157 for all other nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective january 1 2009 and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “sfas no 159” this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after november 15 2007 we did not make this fair value election when we adopted sfas no 159 effective january 1 2008 and therefore it did not have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141 r “business combinations” “sfas no 141 r” sfas no 141 r broadens and clarifies the definition of a business which will result in significantly more of our acquisitions being treated as business combinations rather than asset acquisitions fas 141 r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 early adoption is not permitted and therefore this will only impact prospective acquisitions with no change to the accounting for acquisitions completed prior to or on december 31 2008 the new standard requires us to expense as incurred all acquisition related transaction costs which could include broker fees transfer taxes legal accounting valuation and other professional and consulting fees for acquisitions prior to january 1 2009 these costs were capitalized as part of the acquisition cost the impact to our financial statements will vary significantly depending on the number of acquisitions size of the acquisitions and location of the acquisitions based on acquisitions in the last three years transaction costs for single asset acquisitions typically ranged from 01 million to 10 million with significantly higher transaction costs for an acquisition of a larger portfolio the new standard includes several other changes to the accounting for business combinations including requiring contingent consideration to be measured at fair value at acquisition and subsequently remeasured through the income statement if accounted for as a liability as the fair value changes any adjustments during the purchase price allocation period to be “pushed back” to the acquisition date with prior periods being adjusted for any changes and the business combination to be accounted for on the acquisition date or the date control is obtained during 2008 we expensed all acquisition related costs for acquisitions which did not close prior to december 31 2008 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued statement no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of arb 51” “sfas no 160” the new standard significantly changes the accounting and reporting of minority interests in the consolidated financial statements the new standard requires a noncontrolling interest which is currently referred to as a minority interest to be recognized as a component of equity rather than included in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet where it is currently presented the terminology “minority interest” is changed to “noncontrolling interest” the “minority interest” caption on the statement of operations will be reflected as “net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests” and shown after consolidated net income and will be an adjustment to reconcile to net income this is a presentation only change for minority interest on both the balance sheet and statement of operations and will have no impact to net income total liabilities and equity and earnings per share the statement also requires the recognition of 100 of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions of less than 100 controlling interest with subsequent acquisitions of the noncontrolling interest recorded as equity transactions sfas no 160 is effective january 1 2009 and is to be applied prospectively except for the presentation changes to the balance sheet and income 

  

statement which will be applied retrospectively in the 2009 financial statements effective january 1 2009 we will reclassify 324 million from the mezzanine section of the balance sheet to shareholders’ equity the additional impact on the financial statements will vary depending on the level of transactions with entities involving noncontrolling interests 

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 133” “sfas no 161” sfas no 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 161 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in june 2008 the fasb issued fsp eitf no 0361 “determining whether instruments granted in sharebased payment transactions are participating securities” “fsp eitf no 0361” under the fsp unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to receive dividends whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and should be included in computation of eps pursuant to the twoclass method as part of our stock based compensation program we issue restricted shares which vest over a three to six year period these shares have nonforfeitable rights to dividends immediately after issuance we currently exclude the unvested shares from the basic eps calculation and include them using the treasury stock method in diluted earnings per share we expect the adoption of fsp eitf no 0361 to result in a minimal decrease to our basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for all periods presented the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 and will require retrospective application to all prior period eps data presented in the financial statements early adoption is not permitted 

in november 2008 the eitf issued issue 086 “equity method investment accounting considerations” “eitf 086” which clarified the accounting for certain transactions and impairment considerations involving equity method investments eitf 086 clarified that equity method investments should initially be measured at cost the issuance of shares by the investee would result in a gain or loss on issuance of shares reflected in the income statement of the equity investor and that a loss in value of an equity investment which is other than a temporary decline should be recognized in accordance with apb 18 “the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock” the consensus is effective on a prospective basis beginning on january 1 2009 we do not expect eitf 086 to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

property acquisitions and dispositions 

a summary of our significant acquisitions in 2008 and 2007 is as follows 

 

  

         

on november 16 2007 we purchased the 10 minority interest in three properties located at our fifth avenue hermosa avenue and third street promenade projects for 57 million we now own 100 of these properties 

generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt on occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or downreit units as well as through the assumption of mortgages 

a summary of our significant dispositions in 2008 and 2007 is as follows 

 

  

          

the proceeds from our dispositions were used to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

in 2005 and 2006 warranty reserves for condominium units sold at santana row were established to cover potential costs for materials labor and other items associated with warrantytype claims that may arise within the tenyear statutorily mandated latent construction defect warranty period in 2006 and 2007 we increased our warranty reserves by 25 million and 51 million respectively net of taxes related to defective work done by third party contractors while upgrades were made to certain units being prepared for sale during 2007 and 2008 we evaluated the potentially affected units and as of december 31 2008 have completed the inspections and repairs the extent of the damages encountered in the units and the resulting costs to repair varied considerably amongst the units as a result we have adjusted the warranty reserve to reflect the actual costs incurred related to these issues which is approximately 24 million net of 15 million of taxes the change in the reserve of 52 million is included in “discontinued operations—gain on sale of real estate” in 2008 these amounts do not reflect any amounts we may recover in the future from insurance or the contractors responsible for the defective work due to the inherent uncertainty related to the recovery from insurance or the contractor we are unable to estimate an expected recovery any recovery will be reflected in our financial statements once the amount is determinable considered probable and collectible 

litigation settlement 

during the fourth quarter 2008 we entered into an agreement to settle a litigation matter relating to a shopping center in new jersey where a former tenant alleged that we and our management agent acted improperly by failing to disclose a condemnation action at the property that was pending when the lease was signed in june 2008 we entered into an agreement with the management agent that provided a framework for sharing litigation costs and payment of any damages to the plaintiff the final settlement totaled 23 million of which we paid 115 million and the third party management agent paid 115 million we are currently in the process of settling the amount of the portion of the plaintiff’s legal fees which we are required to pay we expect the amount to be approximately 10 million of which we will pay 50 and the third party management agent will pay 50 our share of the total estimated settlement of 16 million is included in “general and administrative expense” in the statement of operations 

2008 significant debt and equity transactions 

on february 21 2008 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to fix the variable portion of our 200 million term loan through november 6 2008 the first swap fixed the variable rate at 2725 on a notional amount of 100 million and the second swap fixed the variable rate at 2852 on a notional amount of 100 million for a combined fixed rate of 2789 both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value until the swaps ended on november 6 2008 

on july 1 2008 we repaid the 96 million mortgage loan on leesburg plaza which had an original maturity date of october 1 2008 this loan was repaid with funds borrowed on our 300 million revolving credit facility 

on july 15 2008 we exercised a oneyear extension for our 200 million term loan extending the maturity date to november 6 2009 

on august 15 2008 one of the holders redeemed 208 million of the outstanding 500 million balance of our 748 debentures the notice period for additional redemptions has expired these debentures were repaid with funds borrowed on our 300 million revolving credit facility 

  

in connection with the acquisition of courtyard shops and two land parcels at bethesda row we assumed three mortgage notes as follows 

 

  

 on september 25 and 30 2008 we acquired the fee interest in two land parcels under our bethesda row property prior to the transactions we had capital lease obligations totaling 115 million on the two land parcels which were extinguished as part of the transactions 

on december 31 2008 we repaid the 11 million mortgage loan on one of our properties in white marsh md on its maturity date this loan was repaid with funds borrowed on our 300 million revolving credit facility 

outlook 

we seek growth in earnings funds from operations and cash flows primarily through a combination of the following 

 

  

  

 our samecenter growth is primarily driven by increases in rental rates on new leases and lease renewals the infill nature and strong demographics of our properties provide a strategic advantage allowing us to maintain relatively high occupancy and increase rental rates we seek to maintain a mix of strong national regional and local retailers at december 31 2008 no single tenant accounted for more than 26 of annualized base rent 

we continue to see a positive impact from redevelopment of our shopping centers in 2009 and 2010 we have redevelopment projects stabilizing with projected costs of approximately 73 million and 16 million respectively as redevelopment properties are completed spaces that were out of service and newly created spaces begin generating revenue in addition spaces that were not out of service and that have expiring leases may generate higher revenue because we generally receive higher rent on new leases at improved centers 

we continue to review acquisition opportunities in our primary markets that complement our portfolio and provide long term opportunities additionally in 2008 we acquired two properties in south florida and continue to evaluate further acquisitions in the south florida market generally our acquisitions do not initially contribute significantly to earnings growth however they provide long term releasing growth redevelopment opportunities and other strategic opportunities any growth from acquisitions is contingent on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates may affect our success in achieving earnings growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisition 

the current downturn in the economy may impact the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants we have seen tenants experiencing declining sales vacating early or filing for bankruptcy as well as seeking rent relief from us as landlord any reduction in our tenants’ abilities to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges will adversely affect our 

  

financial condition and results of operations further our ability to release vacant spaces may be negatively impacted by the current economic environment while we believe the locations of our centers and diverse tenant base should decrease the negative impact of the economic environment we are likely to see an increase in vacancy that could have a negative impact to our revenue we continue to monitor our tenants’ operating performances as well as trends in the retail industry to evaluate the future impact 

we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and a conservative capital structure we seek to maintain a schedule of debt maturities such that the amount of debt maturing in any one year is manageable with respect to our overall borrowing capacity 

at december 31 2008 the leasable square feet in our shopping centers was 943 occupied and 950 leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

results of operations 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “samecenter” basis information provided on a samecenter basis includes the results of properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared except for properties for which significant development redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties classified as discontinued operations 

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

 

   

property revenues 

total property revenue increased 374 million or 77 to 5205 million in 2008 compared to 4831 million in 2007 the percentage occupied at our shopping centers decreased to 943 at december 31 2008 compared to 954 at december 31 2007 changes in the components of property revenue are discussed below 

rental income 

rental income consists primarily of minimum rent cost recoveries from tenants and percentage rent rental income increased 362 million or 78 to 5020 million in 2008 compared to 4657 million in 2007 due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

 partially offset by 

 

 other property income 

other property income increased 12 million or 92 to 140 million in 2008 compared to 128 million in 2007 included in other property income are items which although recurring tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period such as lease termination fees in 2008 the increase is primarily due to an increase in lease termination fees at redevelopment properties partially offset by a decrease in income from our restaurant joint ventures 

property expenses 

total property expenses increased 192 million or 131 to 1654 million in 2008 compared to 1463 million in 2007 changes in the components of property expenses are discussed below 

rental expenses 

rental expenses increased 104 million or 104 to 1097 million in 2008 compared to 994 million in 2007 this increase is due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 partially offset by 

 

   

as a result of the changes in rental income rental expenses and other property income described above rental expenses as a percentage of rental income plus other property income increased to 213 in 2008 from 208 in 2007 

real estate taxes 

real estate tax expense increased 88 million or 188 to 557 million in 2008 compared to 469 million in 2007 this increase is due primarily to an increase of 67 million related to higher assessments at samecenter and redevelopment properties and 22 million related to properties acquired in 2008 and 2007 

property operating income 

property operating income increased 182 million or 54 to 3551 million in 2008 compared to 3369 million in 2007 as discussed above this increase is due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

 other 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased 122 million or 110 to 992 million in 2008 compared to 1114 million in 2007 this decrease is primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 partially offset by 

 

 gross interest costs were 1045 million and 1192 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively capitalized interest amounted to 53 million and 79 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense increased 02 million or 06 to 267 million in 2008 from 266 million in 2007 this is due to a 16 million litigation settlement in 2008 related to a shopping center in new jersey partially offset by lower personnel related costs 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 94 million or 92 to 1110 million in 2008 from 1016 million in 2007 this increase is due primarily to acquisitions placing into service newly completed redevelopment projects and capital improvements at samecenter and redevelopment properties 

discontinued operations—income 

income from discontinued operations represents the income of properties that have been disposed or will be disposed which is required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported income of 19 million and 68 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively represents the income for the period during which we owned properties sold in 2008 and 2007 

  

discontinued operations—gain on sale of real estate

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we generally generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our common and preferred shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions 

we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings in the short and long term we may seek to obtain funds through the issuance of additional equity unsecured andor secured debt financings joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions that are consistent with this conservative structure 

we have approximately 380 million of debt maturing in 2009 of which 200 million matures in november 2009 and 175 million matures in december 2009 while the maturities do not occur until the end of 2009 we have commenced negotiations under several different alternatives to refinance the debt including a new term loan and encumbering additional properties with mortgage financing we have identified assets that can provide up to 350 million of secured financing proceeds the current recession and dislocation in the capital markets however has resulted in less favorable interest rates for debt financings notwithstanding adverse market conditions we currently believe that cash flows from operations secured and unsecured refinancing opportunities and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance our operations and fund our capital expenditures alternatively if we are unable to access the secured and unsecured debt markets at acceptable terms we may choose to issue common equity to meet our capital needs or pay a portion of our distributions in shares instead of cash as we expect to address the fourth quarter 2009 maturities several months in advance we expect to incur additional interest expense due to higher interest rates on such debt and due to a temporary increase in our debt outstanding until we can use the proceeds to retire maturing debt 

  

our overall capital requirements in 2009 will depend not only on refinancing of the debt maturities but also upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of future phases of existing properties during 2008 2007 and 2006 we expended approximately 1042 million 1116 million and 957 million respectively for development and redevelopment capital expenditures and approximately 338 million 258 million and 240 million respectively for other capital expenditures while the amount of future expenditures will depend on numerous factors we expect to incur similar levels of capital expenditures in 2009 which will be funded on a shortterm basis with the revolving credit facility and on a longterm basis with longer term debt or equity although there is no intent at this time if market conditions continue to deteriorate we may also delay the timing of certain development and redevelopment projects as well as limit future acquisitions reduce our operating expenditures or reevaluate our dividend policy 

in addition to the adverse conditions in the capital markets which could affect our ability to access those markets the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 

  

 cash and cash equivalents were 152 million and 507 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively however cash and cash equivalents are not a good indicator of our liquidity we have a 300 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures july 27 2010 subject to a oneyear extension at our option of which 1235 million was outstanding at december 31 2008 during 2008 the maximum amount of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility was 1590 million and the weighted average amount of borrowings outstanding was 614 million we expect to continue to utilize our credit facility to fund shortterm operating needs including funding capital expenditures to date lenders have funded all of our draw requests under our credit facility and we expect our lenders will continue to fund those draws 

summary of cash flows for 2008 and 2007 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 141 million to 2283 million during the year ended december 31 2008 from 2142 million during the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily attributable to

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have a joint venture arrangement “the partnership” with affiliates of a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners “clarion” we own 30 of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70 as of december 31 2008 the partnership owned seven retail real estate projects we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method and our investment in the partnership was 293 million and 296 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively in total at december 31 2008 the partnership had 814 million of mortgage notes outstanding 

other than the joint venture described above and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table below we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2008 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  

contractual commitments 

the following table provides a summary of our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

 in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above the following potential commitments exist 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and after january 1 1986 an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between onehalf to all of its 2947 interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2008 our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 42 million to 49 million 

b under the terms of one other partnership which owns a project in southern california if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the property owned by the partnership the other partner may require us to purchase their partnership interest at a formula price based upon property operating income the purchase price for the partnership will be paid using our common shares or subject to certain conditions cash if the other partner does not redeem their interest we may choose to purchase the limited partnership interest upon the same terms 

c under the terms of various other partnership agreements for entities the partners have the right to exchange their operating units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2008 a total of 373260 operating units are outstanding 

d in addition to our contractual obligations we have other shortterm liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt recurring corporate expenditures including compensation agreements nonrecurring corporate expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of future phases of existing properties including santana row and assembly square 

e at december 31 2008 we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 105 million which are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the trust 

  

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2008 

 

  

    

        our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2008 we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

the following is a summary of our debt maturities as of december 31 2008 

 

  

     

interest rate hedging 

we use derivative instruments to manage exposure to variable interest rate risk we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we enter into derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” and do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes as of december 31 2008 we had no outstanding hedging instruments 

our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis the effective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings in 2008 2007 and 2006 and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

on february 21 2008 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to fix the variable portion of our 200 million term loan through november 6 2008 the first swap fixed the variable rate at 2725 on a notional amount of 100 million and the second swap fixed the variable rate at 2852 on a notional amount of 100 million for a combined fixed rate of 2789 both swaps were designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and were recorded at fair value until the swaps ended on november 6 2008 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 

  

  

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

  

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis however we must generally distribute 90 of our reit taxable income including net capital gain to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows 

 

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

as of december 31 2008 we were not party to any open derivative financial instruments we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2031 or through 2106 including capital lease obligations have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2008 we had 14 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2008 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 470 million if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2008 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 495 million 

variable interest rate debt 

we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2008 we had 3329 million of variable rate debt outstanding based upon this amount of variable rate debt if interest rates increased by 10 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 33 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 33 million conversely if interest rates decreased by 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 33 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately 33 million

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and senior vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america this process includes policies and procedures that 

 

   

  

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of our procedures and procedures performed by internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee independent public accountants and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our 

  

chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures

business objectives and strategies 

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail properties with the dominant property type being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers that will 

 

  

  

  

 our traditional focus has been and remains on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers late in 1994 recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance of retailer expansion to main streets we expanded our investment strategy to include “street retail” and “mixeduse” properties the mixeduse properties are typically centered around a retail component but also include office residential andor hotel components 

  

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country in addition because of the infill nature of our locations our properties generally face less competition per capita than properties owned by our peers these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth 

our investments primarily fall into one of the following five categories 

 

  

  

  

  

   

investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion and acquisition opportunities we consider such factors as 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 financing strategies 

our financing strategy is designed to enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible our financing strategy includes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

employees 

at february 22 2008 we had 301 fulltime employees and 155 parttime employees none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 1962 as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on reit taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of reit taxable income we will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed reit taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes the sales of condominiums at santana row which occurred between august 2005 and august 2006 and the sales of bath shopping center key road plaza and riverside plaza in 2007 were conducted through a trs in 2007 2006 and 2005 our trs incurred approximately 15 million 24 million and 35 million respectively of income taxes 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities 

  

could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs superstores and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail electronic commerce and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the securities and exchange commission which we refer to as the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property general economic downturns and other conditions affecting the retail industry may affect the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants any reduction in our tenants’ ability to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result this could reduce our net income 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 16 billion of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 3494 million was secured by 18 of our properties and approximately 761 million represented capital lease obligations on four of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 815 million of debt secured by six properties as of december 31 2007 approximately 14 billion 87 of our debt as of december 31 2007 which includes all of our property secured debt and our capital lease obligations is fixed rate debt our joint venture’s debt of 815 million is also fixed rate debt our organizational 

  

documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur we do not have a policy limiting the ratio of our debt to total capitalization or assets the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt 

our credit facility and term loans include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2007 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

  

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not intend to undertake on our own construction of any new largescale mixeduse groundup development projects however we do intend to complete the development and construction of remaining phases of projects we already have started such as bethesda row in bethesda maryland santana row in san jose california and assembly square in somerville massachusetts we may undertake development of these and other projects if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of community and neighborhood shopping centers in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to adding competitive retail supply the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all the debt could include mortgage loans from third parties or the sale of debt securities equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 16 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2007 approximately 2094 million bears interest at variable rates and was unhedged we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders although we have in the past and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions as to a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates the amounts we are required to pay under the variable rate debt to which the hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost of refinancing or issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or develop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully leased 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood rental loss and acts of terrorism we also currently carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties in california and environmental insurance on most of our properties all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no 

  

longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt seriously our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets jointly with other persons or entities and as of february 22 2008 excluding our joint venture with clarion lion properties fund we hold ten predominantly retail real estate projects jointly with other persons we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals and that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives although we hold the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments as of february 22 2008 we must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance three of these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

in addition on july 1 2004 we entered into a joint venture with affiliates of clarion lion properties fund for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 

  

  

 the terms of our partnership require that certain acquisition opportunities be presented first to the joint venture which limits our ability to acquire properties for our own account which could in turn limit our ability to grow our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2007 this joint venture owned seven properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or 

  

operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure properly to remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

  

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must make generally annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed reit taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 

  

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on unfavorable terms and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding stock if that 

  

happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend rate on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in neighborhood and community shopping centers principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2007 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixedused properties which are operated as 82 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 182 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions of the united states as well as california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2007 total revenue we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

we operate our business on an asset management model where asset management teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we manage our portfolio as two operating regions the east and west property management teams consist of asset managers leasing agents development staff and financial personnel each of whom has responsibility for a distinct portfolio 

  

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 2400 leases with tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 25 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2007 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any recent and future bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant 

geographic diversification 

our 82 real estate projects are located in 12 states and the district of columbia the following table shows by region and state within the region the number of projects the gross leasable area of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2007 

 

  

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2007 represented approximately 33 of total rental revenues 

  

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2007 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2008 and after 2017 in the aggregate in both cases assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2007 

 

   

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all real estate projects in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2007 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail real estate projects principal tenants are the largest tenants in the project based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a project’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in may 2003 first national mortgage company filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california the complaint alleged that a one page document entitled “final proposal” which included language that it was subject to approval of formal documentation constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our santana row property and gave first national mortgage company the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in accordance with a formula included in the “final proposal” a trial as to liability only was held in june 2006 and a jury rendered a verdict against us a trial on the issue of damages has been set for april 2008 the complaint did not specify the amount of damages claimed we have now received reports from our experts and the plaintiff’s experts which show potential damages ranging from 600000 to 24 million we cannot make a reasonable estimate of potential damages until discovery is completed on the damages issue and the court rules on various legal issues impacting the calculation of damages we intend to appeal the jury verdict however no appeal of the judgment can be taken until the trial on damages has been completed if we are not successful in overturning the jury verdict we will be liable for damages depending on the amount of damages awarded it is possible there could be a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in which it becomes both probable that we will have to pay the damages and such damages can be reasonably estimated in any event management does not believe it will have a material impact on our financial position 

we are also involved in a litigation matter relating to a shopping center in new jersey where a former tenant has alleged that we and our management agent acted improperly by failing to disclose a condemnation action at the property that was pending when the lease was signed a trial as to liability only has been concluded and posttrial briefs have been filed but no decision has been rendered one of the plaintiffs in the matter has filed for bankruptcy protection and as a result the judge in our case has stayed further proceedings in the case if we are found liable once the stay has been lifted a trial will be held to determine the amount of damages based on the information available to us we believe there is a reasonable possibility that we will be found liable if a verdict is rendered against us we may seek indemnification from the third party management company that negotiated the lease on our behalf we cannot assess with any certainty at this time the potential damages for which we would be liable if a verdict is rendered against us or the potential amounts we might recover against the third party management company however if a verdict is rendered against us there may be a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in which it becomes both probable that we will have to pay the damages and such damages can be reasonably estimated in any event management does not believe it will have a material impact on our financial position

 on february 22 2008 there were 4385 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our reit taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income state income taxes are not material to our operations or cash flows 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our regular annual dividend rate for 40 consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2007 and 2006 were 2335 per share and 2440 per share including a 020 special dividend respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2008 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under code sec 857b3 to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains 

  

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

 

  

 distributions on our 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares were paid at the rate of 1354 per share per annum commencing on the issuance date of march 8 2007 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 

distributions on our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares were paid at the rate of 2125 per share per annum prior to distributions on our common shares on november 27 2006 the trust redeemed all 5400000 outstanding shares of our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares at their redemption price of 2500 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date of 0159 per share

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership management development and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties as of december 31 2007 we owned or had a majority interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties which are operated as 82 predominantly retail real estate projects comprising approximately 182 million square feet these properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the midatlantic and northeast regions of the united states as well as in california in total these 82 real estate projects were 967 leased at december 31 2007 a joint venture in which we own a 30 interest owned seven retail real estate projects totaling approximately 10 million square feet as of december 31 2007 in total the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 983 leased at december 31 2007 we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 40 consecutive years 

  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which we refer to as gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate or accrual results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

the most significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to base rents straightline rents expense reimbursements and other revenue or income taking into account our expertise in the retail sector tenant credit information both internally and externally available payment history industry trends tenant creditworthiness and the length of remaining lease terms over which certain of these amounts will be collected in some cases primarily relating to straightline rents the collection of these amounts extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a certain portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating more straightline revenue is reasonably collectible than previously estimated and realized the additional straightline rental income is recognized as revenue if our evaluation of tenant credit risk changes indicating a portion of realized straightline rental income is no longer collectible a reserve and bad debt expense is recorded at december 31 2007 and 2006 accounts receivable include approximately 320 million and 248 million respectively related to straightline rents these estimates have a direct impact on our net income 

historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 04 and 14 of rental income and it was 04 in 2007 an increase in our bad debt expense would decrease our net income for example if we had experienced an increase in bad debt of 05 of rental income in 2007 our net income would have been reduced by approximately 23 million 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives the cost of our real estate investments less 

  

salvage value if any is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the asset using straightline rates for financial statement purposes we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors a newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings estimating the useful lives of assets that are longlived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the expected return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to be charged against both the current and future revenues these assessments have a direct impact on our net income the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation charged to that asset in a fiscal period will be which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15 years certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to operating expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of sfas no 13 these estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of abovemarket and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with sfas no 141 business combinations based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the 

  

applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful life of each amortizable intangible asset each reporting period and account for any changes in such estimated useful life over the revised remaining useful life 

longlived assets 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or developed management must evaluate properties for possible impairment of value and for those properties where impairment may be indicated make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over very long periods because our properties typically have a very long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment 

sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” requires that one accounting model be used for longlived assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newlyacquired and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity as a result the sale of a property or the classification of a property as held for sale requires us to report the results of operations of that property as “discontinued operations” 

we are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining whether there is an impairment of an asset actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits warranty claims and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters 

any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in an increase or decrease to net income in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment any changes to our estimated warranty losses would result in an increase or decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuary valuations and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs differ from these accruals it will increase or decrease our net income 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “sfas no 157” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements except for sharebased payments under sfas no 123r we are required to adopt the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities and for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are remeasured at least annually effective january 1 2008 we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 157 for all other nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective january 1 2009 we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 157 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “sfas no 159” this standard permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after november 15 2007 we do not intend to make this fair value election and therefore we do not expect sfas no 159 to have an impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

on december 4 2007 the fasb issued statement no 141 r business combinations “sfas no 141 r” and statement no 160 “ accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 51” “sfas no 160” the new standards significantly change the accounting and reporting of business combination transactions and minority interests in the consolidated financial statements these changes include expensing all acquisition related transaction costs recognizing contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values with subsequent changes generally reflected in earnings recognizing 100 of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions of less than 100 controlling interest and recognizing a noncontrolling interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements we are required to adopt sfas no 141 r for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after january 1 2009 and sfas no 160 on january 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 141 r and sfas no 160 will have on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

property acquisitions and dispositions 

a summary of our significant acquisitions in 2007 and 2006 is as follows 

 

  

        

 generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt on occasion we also finance our acquisitions through the issuance of common stock preferred stock or downreit units as well as through the assumption of mortgages 

on november 16 2007 we purchased the 10 minority interest in three properties located at our fifth avenue hermosa avenue and third street promenade projects for 57 million we now own 100 of these properties 

the linden square acquisition is currently undergoing redevelopment after the initial phases of the redevelopment are completed the project will include approximately 222000 square feet of retail 17000 square feet of office seven affordable residential units and a car dealership the initial phases of redevelopment are expected to be complete in 2008 

the following table provides a summary of acquisitions made by our unconsolidated real estate partnership in 2007 and 2006 

 

  

    

a summary of our significant dispositions in 2007 and 2006 is as follows 

 

  

          

the proceeds from our dispositions were used to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

warranty reserves for condominium units sold at santana row were established to cover potential costs for materials labor and other items associated with warrantytype claims that may arise within the tenyear statutorily mandated latent construction defect warranty period our warranty and latent construction defect reserves are calculated based upon historical industry experience and current known factors variables used in the calculation of the warranty reserves as well as the adequacy of the reserves based on the number of condominium units still under warranty are reviewed on a periodic basis 

during the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we became aware of certain facts and circumstances that caused us to reassess our initial reserve for damages related to defective work done by third party contractors while upgrades were made to the units being prepared for sale based on current estimates we believe the range of possible incremental cost is between 51 million and 93 million net of taxes of 19 million and 26 million respectively before insurance recoveries the full extent of damages and required repairs on any particular unit cannot be determined until we have evaluated whether there was defective work in the unit and determined the extent of damages if any caused by the defective work we are still in the process of evaluating units for potential damage arising from the defective work and to date have completed the repairs caused by the defective work in only a limited number of units the extent of the damages encountered in those units and the resulting costs to repair varied considerably accordingly our current estimates are based on limited and varying actual costs we are continuing our evaluation of this matter and in 2007 we increased our reserves by 51 million net of taxes of 19 million to the low end of our estimated range of potential obligation related to these particular damages this range excludes any amounts we may recover from insurance or the contractors responsible for the defective work in the event that our evaluation allows us to develop a better estimate of these damages we will adjust our estimate accordingly this increase reduces our gain on sale of condominium units that were sold during 2005 and 2006 the increase in the reserve is included in “discontinued operations—gain on sale of real estate” the reserve is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses although we consider the reserve to be adequate there can be no assurance that the reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to the difference between the assumptions used to estimate the reserve and actual losses 

2007 significant debt equity and other transactions 

on march 8 2007 as part of the consideration to acquire the white marsh portfolio we issued i 884066 common shares at 8818 per share par value 001 per share ii 399896 shares of 5417 series 1 cumulative convertible preferred shares “series 1 preferred shares” at the liquidation preference of 25 per share par value 001 per share and iii 185504 downreit operating partnership units at 8818 per share the series 1 preferred shares accrue dividends at a rate of 5417 per year and are convertible at any time by the holders to our common shares at a conversion rate of 10469 per share the series 1 preferred shares are also convertible under certain circumstances at our election the holders of the series 1 preferred shares have no voting rights 

in connection with the acquisition of the white marsh portfolio and shoppers’ world we assumed five mortgage notes as follows 

 

  

   

on april 10 2007 our unconsolidated real estate partnership entered into a mortgage note for approximately 42 million the mortgage note is secured by the lake barcroft property which was acquired in february 2007 and by barcroft plaza the lake barcroft property is adjacent to and operated as part of barcroft plaza the note matures on july 1 2016 bears interest at 571 per annum and requires monthly payments of interest only 

on october 26 2007 we acquired the fee interest in midpike plaza and huntington shopping center and sold our leasehold interest in six properties allwood blue star brunswick clifton hamilton and rutgers shopping centers prior to the transaction we had capital lease obligations totaling 764 million on all eight properties the capital lease obligations were extinguished as part of the transactions 

on november 9 2007 we entered into a 200 million unsecured term loan bearing interest at libor plus 575 basis points the loan matures on november 6 2008 subject to a oneyear extension at our option and is prepayable without penalty the spread over libor is subject to adjustment based on our credit rating 

on november 15 2007 we repaid our 6125 senior notes with a principal amount of 1500 million these notes were repaid with funds borrowed on our 200 million unsecured term loan 

on december 27 2007 we issued 20 million common shares at 8121 per share for cash proceeds of approximately 1624 million before other expenses of the offering the proceeds were used on an interim basis to repay our revolving credit facility 

effective december 31 2007 larry finger our former chief financial officer was no longer employed by the trust under his existing severance agreement his departure was treated as a termination without cause as a result we recognized approximately 06 million related to the accelerated vesting of unvested shares and options and 04 million related to a cash payment to mr finger these amounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income 

outlook 

general 

we anticipate our 2008 income from continuing operations to grow in comparison to our 2007 income from continuing operations we expect this income growth primarily to be generated by a combination of the following 

 

  

 on october 31 2007 we announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of 061 per share on our common shares resulting in an indicated annual rate of 244 per share the regular common dividend was payable on january 15 2008 to common shareholders of record as of january 2 2008 

we continue to see a positive impact on our income as a result of the redevelopment of our shopping centers and higher rental rates on existing spaces as leases on these spaces expire for example leases signed in 2005 2006 and 2007 on spaces for which there was a previous tenant have on average been renewed at double digit cash base rent increases on spaces where the tenant leases are expiring over the next few years our analysis of current market rents as compared to rents on the existing leases leads us to expect that the base rents on new leases will have doubledigit weighted average increases over the cash basis base rents currently in place we anticipate investments in redevelopment projects of approximately 104 million and 55 million to stabilize in 2008 and 2009 respectively as redevelopment properties are completed spaces that were out of service begin generating revenue in addition spaces that were not out of service and that have expiring leases may generate higher revenue because we generally receive higher rent on new leases 

  

at december 31 2007 the leasable square feet in our shopping centers was 954 occupied and 967 leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to leased spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

acquisitions 

we anticipate further growth in earnings from the acquisition of neighborhood and community shopping centers in our primary markets in the east and west regions as well as a reduction in earnings from selective dispositions we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions in additional markets 

any growth in earnings from acquisitions is contingent however on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates also may affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisitions

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we generally generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders overall capital requirements in 2008 will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of future phases of existing properties 

our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt agreements development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions we expect to fund these through a combination of sources which we believe will be available to us including additional and replacement unsecured and secured borrowings issuance of additional equity joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions 

the cash needed to execute our strategy and invest in new properties as well as to pay our debt at maturity must come from one or more of the following sources 

 

  

  

 it is management’s intention that we continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business as a result we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings we may from time to time seek to obtain funds by the following means 

 

  

  

 the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 

  

  

   

we seek to maintain a staggered schedule of debt maturities such that a disproportionate amount of debt maturities does not occur in any one year consistent therewith we have less than 220 million of debt maturities occurring through december 31 2008 200 million of which can be extended for oneyear at our option despite the current turmoil in the credit markets we believe that we will be able to refinance these maturities 

cash and cash equivalents were 507 million and 115 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively cash and cash equivalents are not a good indicator of our liquidity we have a 3000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures july 27 2010 subject to a oneyear extension at our option no amounts were outstanding on the revolving credit facility at december 31 2007 we intend to utilize our revolving credit facility to finance the initial acquisition of properties and meet other shortterm working capital requirements

 offbalance sheet arrangements

we are joint venture partners in eight restaurants at santana row our investment balance in the restaurant joint ventures was approximately 79 million and 86 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively our equity in earnings from the restaurant joint ventures was 22 million 15 million and 13 million in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

we have a joint venture arrangement with affiliates of clarion lion properties fund “clarion” a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners we own 30 of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70 we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method in total at december 31 2007 the partnership had 815 million of mortgage notes outstanding

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and after january 1 1986 an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between 

  

onehalf to all of its 2947 interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2007 our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 46 million to 51 million 

b under the terms of one other partnership which owns a project in southern california if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the property owned by the partnership the other partner may require us to purchase their partnership interest at a formula price based upon property operating income the purchase price for the partnership will be paid using our common shares or subject to certain conditions cash if the other partner does not redeem their interest we may choose to purchase the limited partnership interest upon the same terms 

c street retail san antonio lp a wholly owned subsidiary of the trust entered into a development agreement the “agreement” in 2000 with the city of san antonio texas the “city” related to the redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along houston street under the agreement we are required to issue an annual letter of credit commencing on october 1 2002 and ending on september 30 2014 that covers our designated portion of the debt service should the incremental tax revenue generated in the zone not cover the debt service we posted a letter of credit with the city on september 25 2002 for 08 million and the letter of credit remains outstanding as of december 31 2007 we have funded approximately 13 million related to this obligation in anticipation of further shortfalls of incremental tax revenues to the city we have accrued approximately 03 million as of december 31 2007 to cover additional payments we may be obligated to make as part of the project costs 

d under the terms of various other partnership agreements for entities the partners have the right to exchange their operating units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2007 a total of 380938 operating units are outstanding 

e in addition to our contractual obligations we have other shortterm liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt recurring corporate expenditures including compensation agreements nonrecurring corporate expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of future phases of existing properties including santana row and assembly square 

f at december 31 2007 we had letters of credit outstanding of approximately 106 million the majority of these letters of credit are collateral for existing indebtedness and other obligations of the trust 

  

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2007 

 

  

    

      our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2007 we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

below are the aggregate principal payments required as of december 31 2007 under our debt financing arrangements by year scheduled principal installments and amounts due at maturity are included 

 

  

our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

      

interest rate hedging 

as of december 31 2007 we have no outstanding hedging instruments we may enter into interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks that qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we do not purchase derivatives for speculation our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value the effective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings in 2007 2006 and 2005 and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

in august 2002 in anticipation of a 150 million senior unsecured note offering we entered into a treasury lock that fixed the five year treasury rate at 3472 through august 19 2002 on august 16 2002 we priced the senior unsecured notes with a scheduled closing date of august 21 2002 and closed on the associated rate lock fiveyear treasury rates declined between the pricing period and the settlement of the rate lock and therefore we paid 15 million to settle the rate lock as a result of the august 19 2002 fire at santana row we did not proceed with the note offering at that time however we consummated a 150 million 6125 senior unsecured note offering on november 2002 and thus the hedge loss was amortized into interest expense over the life of these notes which matured on november 15 2007 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to generally our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 

  

  

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

  

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must generally distribute 90 of our reit taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows 

 

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

as of december 31 2007 we were not party to any open derivative financial instruments we may enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt quoted market prices were used to estimate the fair value of our marketable senior notes and debentures and discounted cash flow analysis is generally used to estimate the fair value of our mortgages and notes payable considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2031 or through 2106 including capital lease obligations have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates however interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments at december 31 2007 we had 14 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2007 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 701 million if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2007 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 710 million 

variable interest rate debt 

we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2007 we had 2094 million of variable rate debt outstanding based upon this amount of variable rate debt if interest rates increased by 10 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 21 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 21 million conversely if interest rates decreased by 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 21 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately 21 million

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of procedures and our internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee independent public accountants and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our 

  

independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 5 a “significant deficiency” is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting a “deficiency” in internal control over financial reporting exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 5 as a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report

business objectives and strategies 

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of high quality retail properties with the dominant property type being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers that will 

 

  

  

  

 our traditional focus has been and remains on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers late in 1994 recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance of retailer expansion to main streets we expanded our investment strategy to include “street retail” and “mixeduse” properties the mixeduse properties are typically centered around a retail component but also include office residential andor hotel components 

  

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country in addition because of the infill nature of our locations our properties generally face less competition per capita than properties owned by our peers these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth 

our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories 

 

  

  

  

 investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion and acquisition opportunities we consider such factors as 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 financing strategies 

our financing strategy is designed to enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible our financing strategy includes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 employees 

at december 31 2006 we had 221 fulltime employees and 114 parttime employees none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

  

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 1962 as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on reit taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of reit taxable income we will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed reit taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries each of which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes the sales of condominiums at santana row which occurred between august 2005 and august 2006 were conducted through a trs as a result of these condominium sales our trs incurred approximately 24 million and 35 million of income taxes in 2006 and 2005 respectively other than the condominium sales our trs activities have been limited and they did not incur any significant income taxes 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

  

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past 

however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail electronic commerce and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the securities and exchange commission which 

  

we refer to as the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property general economic downturns and other conditions affecting the retail industry may affect the success of our tenants’ retail operations and therefore the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants any reduction in our tenants’ ability to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant numbers of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores at a property could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result this could reduce our net income 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have a substantial amount of debt as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 17 billion of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 285 million was secured by 15 of our properties and approximately 149 million represented capital lease obligations on 12 of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 774 million of debt secured by six properties as of december 31 2006 in total approximately 16 billion of our debt as of december 31 2006 which includes all of our property secured debt including the property secured debt of the joint venture and our capital lease obligations is fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur we do not have a policy limiting the ratio of our debt to total capitalization or assets the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt 

our credit facility and term loans include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

  

our development activities have inherent risks 

the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not intend to undertake on our own construction of any new largescale mixeduse groundup development projects however we do intend to complete the development and construction of remaining phases of projects we already have started such as bethesda row in bethesda maryland santana row in san jose california and assembly square in somerville massachusetts we may undertake development of these and other projects if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted return basis if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy is focused on the redevelopment and acquisition of community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by grocery stores drugstores or high volume valueoriented retailers that provide consumer necessities the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all the debt could include mortgage loans from third parties or the sale of debt securities equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 17 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2006 approximately 107 million bears interest at variable rates and was unhedged we may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase the interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders although we have in the past and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions as to a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates the amounts we are required to pay under the variable rate debt to which the hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost of issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or develop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully leased 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood rental loss and acts of terrorism we also currently carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties in california and environmental insurance on most of our properties all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance 

  

companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt seriously our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets jointly with other persons or entities and as of february 23 2007 excluding our joint venture with clarion lion properties fund we hold eight shopping centers and five urban retail and mixeduse properties jointly with other persons we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals and that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives although we hold the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments as of february 23 2007 we must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance five of these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

in addition on july 1 2004 we entered into a new joint venture with affiliates of clarion lion properties fund for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 

  

  

 the terms of our partnership require that certain acquisition opportunities be presented first to the joint venture which limits our ability to acquire properties for our own account which could in turn limit our ability to grow our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2006 this joint venture owned six properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be 

  

required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure properly to remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws also may change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

  

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must make generally annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed reit taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 

  

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on unfavorable terms and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive 

  

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding stock if that happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend rate on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in neighborhood and community shopping centers principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors

 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2006 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in 111 community and neighborhood shopping centers and retail mixedused properties comprising approximately 188 million square 

  

feet located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the northeast and midatlantic united states as well as california in addition we own one apartment complex in maryland no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2006 total revenue or net income we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

we operate our business on an asset management model where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we have divided our portfolio of properties into two operating regions the east and west each region is operated under the direction of one or more asset managers with dedicated leasing property management and financial staff and operates largely autonomously with respect to daytoday operating decisions 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 2300 leases ranging from sole proprietors to major national retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 25 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2006 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any recent and future bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant 

geographic diversification 

our 112 properties including our one apartment complex are located in 14 states and the district of columbia the following table shows by region and state within the region the number of properties the gross leasable area of commercial space and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area of commercial space in each state as of december 31 2006 

 

   

   

leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs caused by inflation and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases primarily with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2006 represented approximately 28 of total revenues 

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2006 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2007 and after 2016 in the aggregate in both cases assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2006 

 

   

retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all properties in which we owned an equity interest had a leasehold interest or controlled and are consolidated as of december 31 2006 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail properties principal tenants are the largest tenants in the property based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a property’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in may 2003 first national mortgage company filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the northern district of california the complaint alleged that a one page document entitled “final proposal” which included language that it was subject to approval of formal documentation constituted a ground lease of a parcel of property located adjacent to our santana row property and gave first national mortgage company the option to require that we acquire the property at a price determined in accordance with a formula included in the “final proposal” the plaintiff is seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages a trial as to liability only was held and on june 27 2006 a jury rendered a verdict against us a case management conference has been scheduled for march 23 2007 at which time we expect a schedule to be set for additional discovery and a trial date on the issue of damages the complaint did not specify the amount of damages claimed and we cannot make a reasonable estimate of potential damages until experts are retained and additional discovery is completed on the damages issue 

we are also involved in a litigation matter relating to a shopping center in new jersey where a former tenant has alleged that we through our management agent engaged in fraud by failing to disclose a condemnation action at the property that was pending when the lease was signed a trial as to liability only began on february 26 2007 and if we are found liable a trial will be held to determine the amount of damages based on the evidence and information available to us we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a verdict may be rendered against us if a verdict is rendered against us we will seek indemnification from the third party management company that negotiated the lease on our behalf we cannot assess with any certainty at this time the potential damages for which we would be liable if a verdict is rendered against us or the potential amounts we would recover against the third party management company however if a verdict is rendered against us there may be a material adverse impact on our net income in the period during which our indemnification claim is pending 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of shareholders 

no matters were submitted to a vote of our shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december 31 2006

 item 5 market for our common equity and related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities tableend our common shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “frt” listed below are the high and low closing prices of our common shares as reported on the new york stock exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated 

 

  on february 23 2007 there were 4449 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our reit taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to generally distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income state income taxes are not material to our operations or cash flows 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our annual dividend rate for 39 consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per common share for 2006 and 2005 were 2440 per share and 2320 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2007 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under code sec 857b3 to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains for 2005 a portion of our distributions was designated as capital gain dividend 

  

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

 

 distributions on our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares were paid at the rate of 2125 per share per annum prior to distributions on our common shares on november 27 2006 the trust redeemed all 5400000 outstanding shares of our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares at their redemption price of 2500 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date of 0159 per share we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements had or will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 

recent sales of unregistered shares 

all equity securities sold by us during 2006 that were not registered have been previously reported in a quarterly report on form 10q 

purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers 

no equity securities were purchased by us during 2006 however 4919 common shares were placed into treasury as a result of restricted shares forfeited by former employees 

  




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership management development and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties as of december 31 2006 we owned or had a majority interest in 111 community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties comprising approximately 188 million square feet our properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the midatlantic and northeast regions of the united states as well as in california in total these 111 commercial properties were 965 leased at december 31 2006 a joint venture in which we own a 30 interest owned four neighborhood shopping centers totaling approximately 07 million square feet as of december 31 2006 in total the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 987 leased at december 31 2006 we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 39 consecutive years 

  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which we refer to as gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate or accrual results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

the most significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to base rents straightline rents expense reimbursements and other revenue or income taking into account our expertise in the retail sector tenant credit information both internally and externally available payment history industry trends tenant creditworthiness and the length of remaining lease terms over which certain of these amounts will be collected in some cases primarily relating to straightline rents the collection of these amounts extends beyond one year our experience relative to unbilled straightline rents is that a certain portion of the amounts otherwise recognizable as revenue is never billed to or collected from tenants due to early lease terminations lease modifications bankruptcies and other factors accordingly the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured these estimates have a direct impact on our net income historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 05 and 10 of rental income and it was 02 in 2006 an increase in our bad debt expense would decrease our net income for example if we had experienced an increase in bad debt of 05 of rental income in 2006 our net income would have been reduced by approximately 22 million 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for us as well as the industry as a whole we capitalize real estate investments and depreciate them in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives the cost of our real estate investments less salvage value if any is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the asset using straightline rates for financial statement purposes we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors a newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings estimating the useful lives of assets that are longlived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation charged to that asset in a fiscal period will be 

  

which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15 years certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to operating expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of sfas no 13 these estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis these assessments have a direct impact on net income certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge against both the current and future revenues we periodically review the lives of assets and any decrease in asset lives could have the effect of increasing depreciation expense while any analysis indicating that lives are longer than we have assumed could have the effect of decreasing depreciation expense in order to determine the impact on depreciation expense of a different average life of our real estate assets taken as a whole we used 25 years which is the approximate average life of all assets being depreciated at the end of 2006 if the estimated useful lives of all real estate assets being depreciated were increased by one year the consolidated annual depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately 37 million 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations based on these estimates we 

  

allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful life of each amortizable intangible asset each reporting period and account for any changes in such estimated useful life over the revised remaining useful life 

longlived assets 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or developed management must evaluate properties for possible impairment of value and for those properties where impairment may be indicated make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over very long periods because our properties typically have a very long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment 

sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” requires that one accounting model be used for longlived assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newlyacquired and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity as a result the sale of a property or the classification of a property as held for sale requires us to report the results of operations and cash flows of that property as “discontinued operations” 

we are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining whether there is an impairment of an asset actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters 

any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in a reduction to net income if the actual loss is greater than our estimate in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment any increases to our estimated warranty losses would usually result in a decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuary valuations and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs exceed these accruals it will reduce our net income 

  

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 

prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principle board opinion “apb” no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” and related interpretations as permitted by financial accounting standard “sfas” no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” under apb no 25 no stock based compensation costs were recognized in the statement of operations for stock options as our options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of our common shares on the date of grant effective january 1 2006 we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” using the modifiedprospectivetransition method under this transition method compensation cost recognized beginning january 1 2006 includes a compensation costs for all sharebased payments granted prior to but not vested as of january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 123 and b compensation cost for all sharebased payments granted subsequent to january 1 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 123r prior to january 1 2006 we used the blackscholes model to value stock options and we intend to continue to use this model to value stock options issued subsequent to january 1 2006 

on january 1 2006 we recorded the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 123r this cumulative effect resulted in decreasing accrued liabilities by 33 million and increasing shareholder equity by 33 million these balance sheet changes related to deferred compensation on unvested shares under sfas no 123r deferred compensation is no longer recorded at the time unvested shares are issued sharebased compensation expense is now recorded over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to equity generally additional paidin capital 

new accounting pronouncements 

in july 2006 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued fasb interpretation no 48 “fin 48” “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes”—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” fin 48 was issued to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of recognition disclosure and measurement related to accounting for uncertain income tax positions we are required to adopt fin 48 effective january 1 2007 we do not believe the adoption of fin 48 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 108 “sab 108” “considering the effects of prior year misstatements in current year financial statements” sab 108 was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statements misstatements historically there have been two widelyused methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements these methods are commonly referred to as the “rollover” method and the “iron curtain” method the rollover method quantifies the amount by which the current income statement is misstated the iron curtain method quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 

sab 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each the income statement balance sheet and the related disclosures this approach is commonly referred to as the “dual approach” we adopted sab 108 during the fourth quarter of 2006 in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ending december 31 2006 the adoption of sab 108 did not impact our financial positions results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas no 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements sfas no 157 applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements except for sharebased payments under sfas no 123r we are required to adopt sfas no 157 effective january 1 2008 we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 157 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

  

property acquisitions and dispositions 

a summary of our significant acquisitions in 2006 and 2005 is as follows 

 

      generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt on occasion we assume mortgages in the connection with certain acquisitions as noted in the acquisitions table above 

the linden square acquisition is currently undergoing redevelopment after the initial phases of the redevelopment are completed the project will include approximately 222000 square feet of retail 17000 square feet of office seven affordable residential units and a car dealership the initial phases of redevelopment are expected to be complete in 2008 

the assembly squaresturtevant street acquisition includes an approximately 332000 square foot enclosed mall in the city of somerville massachusetts for which the redevelopment into a power center was completed in 2006 and an adjacent tenacre 220000 square foot retailindustrial complex as of december 31 2006 we have invested a total of 112 million in the property 

the acquisition of assembly square also included zoning entitlements to add four mixeduse buildings on 35 acres which could include approximately 41000 square feet of retail space 51000 square feet of office space 

  

and 239 residential units the acquisition also included an option to purchase adjacent land parcels all of which are zoned for dense mixeduse development we expect to structure any future development of assembly square in a manner designed to mitigate our risk which may include selling entitlements or codeveloping with other real estate companies 

on october 16 2006 we acquired the leasehold interest in melville mall an approximately 248000 square feet shopping center located in huntington new york under a 20year master lease additionally we loaned the owner of melville mall 341 million secured by a second mortgage on the property we have an option to purchase the shopping center on or after october 16 2021 for a price of 50 million plus the assumption of the first mortgage and repayment of our second mortgage as a result of these transactions we control this property and retain substantially all of the economic benefits and risks associated with it accordingly upon acquiring the leasehold interest we consolidated this property and its operations 

the following table provides a summary of significant acquisitions made by our unconsolidated real estate partnership in 2006 and 2005 

 

  a summary of our significant dispositions in 2006 and 2005 is as follows 

 

       

the proceeds from our dispositions were used to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

2006 significant debt equity and other transactions 

on march 10 2006 we repaid our 699 medium term notes with a principal amount of 405 million these notes were repaid with funds borrowed on our revolving credit facility 

on july 17 2006 we issued 1200 million of fixed rate notes which mature on july 15 2012 and bear interest at 60 and 1300 million of fixed rate notes which mature on january 15 2017 and bear interest at 62 our net proceeds from these note offerings after issuance discounts and underwriting fees were 2479 million these proceeds along with 24 million borrowed on our revolving credit facility were used to repay all the principal of our 1500 million fiveyear term loan due october 2008 and 1000 million threeyear term loan due october 2006 and 03 million of related accrued interest on july 17 2006 

in order to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on the 1500 million fiveyear term loan due october 2008 we entered into an interest rate swap in january 2004 which fixed the libor portion of the interest rate on this term loan at 2401 through october 8 2006 the full notional amount of this swap qualified as a cash flow hedge until we repaid this term loan on july 17 2006 on july 17 2006 we did not redesignate this swap and the related 12 million included in accumulated other comprehensive income was recognized into earnings 

on july 28 2006 we replaced our existing revolving credit facility with a new 3000 million unsecured revolving credit facility the new revolving credit facility matures on july 27 2010 subject to a oneyear extension at our option and initially bears interest at libor plus 425 basis points the spread over libor is subject to adjustment based on our credit rating 

on august 4 2006 we amended the 177 million second mortgage note receivable which is secured by a hotel in san jose california the amended note decreased the interest rate from 14 to 9 per annum requires monthly payments of principal and interest based on a 15year amortization schedule and matures on august 20 2016 

in connection with the acquisitions of bath shopping center and chelsea commons on august 24 2006 and august 25 2006 we assumed two mortgage notes one in connection with each property with fair values of approximately 111 million and 80 million respectively the bath shopping center and chelsea commons mortgages mature on july 1 2028 and january 15 2031 respectively and bear interest at 713 and 536 respectively both notes require monthly payments of principal and interest 

on august 24 2006 we entered into a 150 million unsecured credit agreement the “bridge loan” bearing interest at libor plus 425 basis points and maturing on december 29 2006 the bridge loan was used to provide interim financing for the acquisition of properties and was fully repaid on september 19 2006 using the proceeds from the issuance of common stock 

on september 19 2006 we issued 20 million common shares at 7451 per share after deducting underwriting discounts and fees netting approximately 1492 million in cash proceeds before other expenses of the offering the proceeds were used on an interim basis to repay debt from the acquisition of three properties in new england and for general corporate purposes ultimately the proceeds were used to redeem the series b preferred shares on november 27 2006 

on september 28 2006 we reopened the 60 and 62 fixed rate notes that were initially issued on july 17 2006 we issued an additional 550 million of fixed rate notes which mature on july 15 2012 and bear interest at 60 and an additional 700 million of fixed rate notes which mature on january 15 2017 and bear 

  

interest at 62 the additional note issuances are fully fungible rank equally with and form a single issue and series with the initial notes issued on july 17 2006 our net proceeds from the september 2006 note offerings after issuance premiums underwriting fees and accrued interest were 1301 million these proceeds were used to reduce the borrowings under our unsecured credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

on october 16 2006 we acquired the leasehold interest in melville mall the fee interest in the property was encumbered by an existing mortgage note with a fair value of approximately 252 million this mortgage note bears interest at 525 per annum requires monthly payments of interest and principal based on a 25year amortization schedule and matures on september 1 2014 we are required to make the payment on this mortgage as part of our rent payment under our lease because we control this property and retain substantially all of the economic benefits and risks associated with it we consolidate this property its operations and this mortgage note 

on november 27 2006 we redeemed all 5400000 outstanding shares of our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares no par value the series b preferred shares were redeemed at their redemption price of 2500 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date of approximately 016 per share for an aggregate redemption price of approximately 2516 per share or 1359 million in total dividends on the series b preferred shares ceased to accrue on november 27 2006 the redemption also resulted in a deemed dividend of 48 million for the difference between the redemption amount and carrying cost 

on december 1 2006 we issued 1350 million of fixed rate notes which mature on december 1 2013 and bear interest at 54 our net proceeds from these note offerings after underwriting fees were 1342 million the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including repaying amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 

outlook 

general 

we anticipate our 2007 income from continuing operations to grow in comparison to our 2006 income from continuing operations we expect this income growth primarily to be generated by a combination of the following 

 

  

 on november 6 2006 we announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of 0575 per share on our common shares resulting in an indicated annual rate of 230 per share the regular common dividend was payable on january 16 2007 to common shareholders of record as of january 2 2007 

we continue to see a positive impact on our income as a result of the redevelopment of our shopping centers and higher rental rates on existing spaces as leases on these spaces expire we anticipate investments in redevelopment projects of approximately 109 million and 97 million to stabilize in 2007 and 2008 respectively as redevelopment properties are completed spaces that were out of service begin generating revenue in addition spaces that were not out of service and that have expiring leases may generate higher revenue because we generally receive higher rent on new leases for example many of the leases with rents commencing in 2006 were signed in 2005 or earlier and leases signed in 2004 2005 and 2006 on spaces for which there was a previous tenant have on average been renewed at double digit base rent increases on spaces where the tenant leases are expiring in 2007 our analysis of current market rents as compared to rents on the existing leases leads us to expect that on average the base rents in new leases will have doubledigit weighted average increases over the base rents currently in place 

  

at december 31 2006 the leasable square feet in our shopping centers was 954 occupied and 965 leased the leased rate is higher than the occupied rate due to spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied our occupancy percentage and leased percentage increased from 939 and 963 respectively at december 31 2005 to 956 and 973 respectively at september 30 2006 however our occupancy percentage and leased percentage decreased as of december 31 2006 due to 93000 square feet vacated as a result of the chapter 7 liquidation of tower records and storehouse furniture our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to factors including acquisitions the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects lease expirations and tenant bankruptcies 

santana row 

santana row located in san jose california includes approximately 563000 square feet of retail space 295 residential rental units and a ground lease to a 213room hotel the 295 residential units include 259 residential units delivered in 2005 and 2006 plus 36 preexisting residential units the 295 residential rental units do not include 219 units that have been sold as condominiums our total investment in santana row excluding future phases is approximately 431 million which includes the 563000 square feet of retail space the 295 residential rental units the related common areas and infrastructure and 13 million invested in restaurant ventures net of insurance proceeds received related to the 2002 fire and proceeds from the sale of the 219 residential units 

we are developing a master plan for the remaining parcels at santana row which comprise approximately 134 acres of land our remaining entitlements consist of approximately 135000 square feet of retail space 897 residential units and either a 191room hotel or an additional 190 residential units we are evaluating the feasibility of utilizing these entitlements in future development at santana row but there is no guaranty that we will ultimately pursue or complete any part of the development of the remaining parcels 

acquisitions 

we anticipate further growth in earnings from acquisitions of neighborhood and community shopping centers in our primary markets in the east and west regions as well as a reduction in earnings from selective dispositions 

any growth in earnings from acquisitions is contingent however on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates also may affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisitions

general and administrative expense 

general and administrative expense increased 14 million or 72 to 213 million in 2006 compared to 199 million in 2005 this is primarily due to an increase in compensation including increased grant expense under sfas no 123r being partially offset by an increase in compensation capitalized as a result of increased leasing and redevelopment activities 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 87 million or 98 to 976 million in 2006 from 889 million in 2005 this increase is due primarily to depreciation on acquired properties improvements at samecenter properties and placing into service the newly constructed residential rental units at santana row and retail development at assembly square 

  

minority interests 

income to minority partners decreased 09 million or 168 to 44 million in 2006 from 52 million in 2005 this decrease is due primarily to a decrease in earnings at a property under redevelopment which is held in a nonwholly owned partnership and a decrease in operating units held by partners in certain of our “downreit” partnerships

segment results 

we operate our business on an asset management model where property management teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we manage our portfolio as two operating regions east and west property management teams consist of regional directors leasing agents development staff and financial personnel each of whom has responsibility for a distinct portfolio 

the following selected key segment data is presented for 2006 2005 and 2004 the results of properties classified as discontinued operations have been excluded from rental income total revenue and property operating income from the following table 

 

  east 

the east region extends roughly from new england south through metropolitan washington dc and further south through virginia and north carolina this region also includes several properties in illinois and michigan as of december 31 2006 the east region consisted of 78 properties including our one apartment complex and was 969 leased 

total revenue in our east region increased 319 million or 100 in 2006 and 170 million or 57 in 2005 these increases are primarily attributable to acquisitions and increased rental rates and occupancy growth in total revenue attributable to acquisitions was 150 million in 2006 and 31 million in 2005 the percentage leased was 97 97 and 96 at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the ratio of property operating income to total revenue was 724 713 and 693 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the improvement in this ratio has primarily resulted from increased rental rates increased occupancy and lower bad debt expense 

  

west 

the west region extends from texas to the west coast as of december 31 2006 the west region consisted of 34 properties including santana row and was 938 leased 

total revenue in our west region increased 107 million or 117 in 2006 and 78 million or 94 in 2005 these increases are primarily attributable to growth in total revenue at santana row as additional phases were brought into service and acquisitions these increases in rental revenue were partially offset by decreases in fire insurance proceeds of 31 million and 50 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the insurance proceeds were included in rental income as they relate largely to lost rents on delayed openings of the residential and retail units and rental concessions to tenants due to the august 2002 fire at santana row growth in total revenue attributable to acquisitions was 53 million and 45 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the percentage leased was 94 94 and 93 at december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the ratio of property operating income to total revenue was 642 637 and 579 in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the improvement in this ratio in 2005 is due primarily to increased occupancy at santana row and decreased operating expenses resulting from leasing marketing and other startup activities related to santana row 

the overall return on investment in our west region is significantly less than the overall return on investment in our east region this is due primarily to the following factors 

 

  

  

 we expect that returns on investment in our west region will continue to rise over time but that they will not necessarily rise to the same level of overall returns that are generated in our east region because of the lower historical basis in our east coast properties 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we generally generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our shareholders in the form of dividends as a reit we must generally make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring expenditures nonrecurring expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders if any overall capital requirements in 2007 will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of future phases of existing properties 

our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions we expect to fund these through a combination of sources which we believe will be available to us including additional and replacement unsecured and secured borrowings issuance of additional equity joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions 

  

the cash needed to execute our strategy and invest in new properties as well as to pay our debt at maturity must come from one or more of the following sources 

 

  

  

 it is management’s intention that we continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business as a result we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings we may from time to time seek to obtain funds by the following means 

 

  

  

 the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 

  

  

 cash and cash equivalents were 115 million and 86 million at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively cash and cash equivalents are not a good indicator of our liquidity we have a 3000 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures july 28 2010 subject to a oneyear extension at our option we intend to utilize our revolving credit facility to finance the initial acquisition of properties and meet other shortterm working capital requirements 

summary of cash flows for 2006 and 2005 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 95 million to 1844 million during the year ended december 31 2006 from 1749 million during the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily attributable to

     our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2006 we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

below are the aggregate principal payments required as of december 31 2006 under our debt financing arrangements by year scheduled principal installments and amounts due at maturity are included 

 

 our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

   interest rate hedging 

we enter into interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks that qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we do not purchase derivatives for speculation our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value the effective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected we 

  

assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings in 2006 2005 and 2004 and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

in january 2004 we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the libor portion of our 150 million term loan issued in october of 2003 this swap fixed the libor portion at 2401 through october 2006 the full notional amount of this swap qualified as a cash flow hedge until we repaid this loan on july 17 2006 

in august 2002 in anticipation of a 150 million senior unsecured note offering we entered into a treasury lock that fixed the five year treasury rate at 3472 through august 19 2002 on august 16 2002 we priced the senior unsecured notes with a scheduled closing date of august 21 2002 and closed on the associated rate lock fiveyear treasury rates declined between the pricing period and the settlement of the rate lock and therefore we paid 15 million to settle the rate lock as a result of the august 19 2002 fire at santana row we did not proceed with the note offering at that time however we consummated a 150 million 6125 senior unsecured note offering on november 2002 and thus the hedge loss is being amortized into interest expense over the life of these notes 

we also purchased an interest rate swap that terminated in march 2006 with a notional amount of 405 million upon issuance of our 699 medium term notes which reduced the effective interest rate from 699 to 6894 

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to generally our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute 90 of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 

  

  

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a 

  

quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must generally distribute 90 of our reit taxable income to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows 

 

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we also enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes we were exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter party to our interest rate swap used to fix the libor portion of our 150 million term loan the counterparty of this swap had a longterm debt rating of “a” by standard and poor’s rating service and “a1” by moody’s investor service as of december 31 2006 we were not party to any open derivative financial instruments 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2028 or through 2077 including capital lease obligations have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments however at december 31 2006 we had 14 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2006 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 732 million if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2006 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 834 million 

variable interest rate debt 

we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2006 we had 1074 million of variable rate debt outstanding based upon this amount of variable rate debt if interest rates increased by 10 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 11 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 11 million conversely if interest rates decreased by 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 11 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately 11 million

disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports such as this report on form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure these controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in rule 13a15e promulgated under the exchange act rules adopted by the sec require that we present the conclusions of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles this process includes policies and procedures that 

 

   

  

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of procedures and our internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee independent public accountants and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our 

  

chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 2 a “significant deficiency” is a “control deficiency” or a combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with gaap such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected a “control deficiency” exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 2 as a significant deficiency or a combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report

business objectives and strategies 

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of quality retail properties with the dominant property type being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers that will 

 

  

  

  

 our traditional focus has been and remains on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers late in 1994 recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance of retailer expansion to main streets we expanded our investment strategy to include “street retail” and “mixeduse” properties the mixeduse properties are typically centered around a retail component but also include office residential andor hotel components 

operating strategies 

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely 

  

populated and affluent areas of the country in addition because of the infill nature of our locations our properties generally face less competition per capita than properties owned by our peers these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increase the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 investing strategies 

our investment strategy is to deploy capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future income growth 

our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories 

 

  

  

  

 investment criteria 

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion and acquisition opportunities we consider such factors as 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 financing strategies 

our financing strategy is designed to enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible our financing strategy includes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 employees 

at december 31 2005 we had 278 fulltime employees and 116 parttime employees none of the employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

tax status 

we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 1962 as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on reit 

  

taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income excluding net capital gain each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of reit taxable income we will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed reit taxable income 

we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries each of which we refer to as a trs in general a trs may engage in any real estate business and certain nonreal estate businesses subject to certain limitations under the code a trs is subject to federal and state income taxes the sales of condominiums at santana row beginning in august 2005 are being conducted through a trs as a result of these condominium sales our trs incurred approximately 35 million of income taxes in 2005 prior to 2005 our trs activities were limited and they did not incur any significant income taxes 

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the current and former uses of the property the building materials used at the property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past 

  

however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

competition 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although we do not believe that any single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located are dominant in that market this competition may 

 

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail electronic commerce and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 1a risk factors 

this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the securities and exchange commission which we refer to as the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the below risk factors describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive 

  

particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to the following 

revenue from our properties may be reduced or limited if the retail operations of our tenants are not successful 

revenue from our properties depends primarily on the ability of our tenants to pay the full amount of rent and other charges due under their leases on a timely basis some of our leases provide for the payment in addition to base rent of additional rent above the base amount according to a specified percentage of the gross sales generated by the tenants and for reimbursement of real estate taxes and expenses of operating the property the amount of rent and expense reimbursements we receive from our tenants generally will depend in part on the success of our tenants’ retail operations making us vulnerable to general economic downturns and other conditions affecting the retail industry any reduction in our tenants’ ability to pay base rent percentage rent or other charges including the filing by any of our tenants for bankruptcy protection may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our net income depends on the success and continued presence of our “anchor” tenants 

our net income could be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in the business or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any anchor store or anchor tenant anchor tenants generally occupy large amounts of square footage pay a significant portion of the total rents at a property and contribute to the success of other tenants by drawing significant amounts of customers to a property the closing of one or more anchor stores prior to the expiration of the lease for that store or the termination of a lease by one or more of a property’s anchor tenants could adversely affect that property and result in lease terminations by or reductions in rent from other tenants whose leases may permit termination or rent reduction in those circumstances or whose own operations may suffer as a result this could reduce our net income 

we may experience difficulty or delay in renewing leases or releasing space 

we derive most of our revenue directly or indirectly from rent received from our tenants we are subject to the risks that upon expiration or termination of leases whether by their terms as a result of a tenant bankruptcy or otherwise leases for space in our properties may not be renewed space may not be released or the terms of renewal or release including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants may be less favorable than current lease terms as a result our results of operations and our net income could be reduced 

the amount of debt we have and the restrictions imposed by that debt could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we have a substantial amount of debt as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 14 billion of debt outstanding of that outstanding debt approximately 271 million was secured by 13 of our properties and approximately 149 million represented capital lease obligations on 11 of our properties in addition we own a 30 interest in a joint venture that had 472 million of debt secured by four properties as of december 31 2005 in total approximately 12 billion of our debt as of december 31 2005 which includes all of our property secured debt including the property secured debt of the joint venture and our capital lease obligations is fixed rate debt our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur we do not have a policy limiting the ratio of our debt to total capitalization or assets the amount of our debt outstanding from time to time could have important consequences to our shareholders for example it could 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness will depend primarily on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to economic financial competitive and other factors beyond our control there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or meet our other cash needs if we are unable to generate this cash flow from our business we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt sell assets or obtain additional financing to meet our debt obligations and other cash needs including the payment of dividends required to maintain our status as a real estate investment trust we cannot assure you that any such refinancing sale of assets or additional financing would be possible on terms that we would find acceptable 

we are obligated to comply with financial and other covenants in our debt that could restrict our operating activities and the failure to comply with such covenants could result in defaults that accelerate payment under our debt 

our credit facility and term loans include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future we are also required to comply with additional covenants that include among other things provisions 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all of our other financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the covenants listed above and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

our development activities are inherently risky  

general  the groundup development of improvements on real property as opposed to the renovation and redevelopment of existing improvements presents substantial risks we generally do not intend to undertake 

  

construction of any new largescale mixeduse groundup development projects however we do intend to complete the development and construction of remaining phases of projects we already have started such as bethesda row in bethesda maryland and santana row in san jose california and may undertake development of other projects if it is justifiable on a riskadjusted basis if additional phases of any of our existing projects or if any new projects are not successful it may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to the risks associated with real estate investment in general as described elsewhere the risks associated with our remaining development activities include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 santana row  santana row is our largest single investment and if it is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as of december 31 2005 we had more than 450 million net of fire insurance proceeds from the 2002 fire at santana row invested at santana row that amount includes the costs associated with the construction of 256 residential units currently under development we continue to develop a master plan for the remaining parcels at santana row 

the success of santana row will depend on many factors which cannot be assured and are not entirely within our control these factors include among others the demand for retail and residential space the cost of operations including utilities and insurance the availability and cost of capital and the general economy particularly in and around the silicon valley in addition our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by delays or cost overruns in completing future phases of santana row by an inability to achieve the market rents that were projected when the project was commenced or by slower than projected leaseup of the project 

of the residential units at santana row 219 have either been sold or currently are classified as held for sale our costs of operating the project could increase as a result of the sale of these units which would reduce our net income from the project in addition the condominium associations governing those units have some rights to vote on budgets for santana row and some ability to impact the manner in which the project is operated which could adversely impact the success of the project or reduce our net income 

redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 

our investment strategy is focused on the redevelopment and acquisition of community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by grocery stores drugstores or high volume valueoriented retailers that provide consumer necessities the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 our ability to grow will be limited if we cannot obtain additional capital 

our growth strategy is focused on the redevelopment of properties we already own and the acquisition of additional properties we believe that it will be difficult to fund our expected growth with cash from operating activities because in addition to other requirements we are required to distribute to our shareholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains each year to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes as a result we must rely primarily upon the availability of debt or equity capital which may or may not be available on favorable terms or at all the debt could include mortgage loans from third parties or the sale of debt securities equity capital could include our common shares or preferred shares we cannot guarantee that additional financing refinancing or other capital will be available in the amounts we desire or on favorable terms our access to debt or equity capital depends on a number of factors including the market’s perception of our growth potential our ability to pay dividends and our current and potential future earnings depending on the outcome of these factors we could experience delay or difficulty in implementing our growth strategy on satisfactory terms or be unable to implement this strategy 

rising interest rates could adversely affect our cash flow and the market price of our outstanding debt and preferred shares 

of our approximately 14 billion of debt outstanding as of december 31 2005 approximately 165 million bears interest at variable rates and was unhedged we also may borrow additional funds at variable interest rates in the future increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense on our variable rate debt and reduce our cash flow which could adversely affect our ability to service our debt and meet our other obligations and also could reduce the amount we are able to distribute to our shareholders although we have in the past and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements or other transactions as to a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to rising interest rates the amounts we are required to pay under the variable rate debt to which the hedging or similar arrangements relate may increase in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to any of our hedging arrangements in addition an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our debt securities and preferred shares to demand a higher annual yield which could adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities and preferred shares and the cost of issuing additional debt securities or preferred shares 

our performance and value are subject to general risks associated with the real estate industry 

our economic performance and the value of our real estate assets and consequently the value of our investments are subject to the risk that if our properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet our operating expenses including debt service and capital expenditures our cash flow and ability to pay distributions to our 

  

shareholders will be adversely affected as a real estate company we are susceptible to the following real estate industry risks 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 many real estate costs are fixed even if income from our properties decreases 

our financial results depend primarily on leasing space in our properties to tenants on terms favorable to us costs associated with real estate investment such as real estate taxes insurance and maintenance costs generally are not reduced even when a property is not fully occupied rental rates decrease or other circumstances cause a reduction in income from the property as a result cash flow from the operations of our properties may be reduced if a tenant does not pay its rent or we are unable to rent our properties on favorable terms under those circumstances we might not be able to enforce our rights as landlord without delays and may incur substantial legal costs additionally new properties that we may acquire or develop may not produce any significant revenue immediately and the cash flow from existing operations may be insufficient to pay the operating expenses and debt service associated with such new properties until they are fully leased 

competition may limit our ability to purchase new properties and generate sufficient income from tenants 

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in seeking tenants for our existing properties and properties for acquisition this competition may 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants if we are unable to continue to attract appropriate retail tenants to our properties or to purchase new properties in our geographic markets it could materially affect our ability to generate net income service our debt and make distributions to our shareholders 

  

we may be unable to sell properties when appropriate because real estate investments are illiquid 

real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly in addition there are some limitations under federal income tax laws applicable to real estate and to reits in particular that may limit our ability to sell our assets we may not be able to alter our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions our inability to respond quickly to adverse changes in the performance of our investments could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our obligations and make distributions to our shareholders 

our insurance coverage on our properties may be inadequate 

we currently carry comprehensive insurance on all of our properties including insurance for liability fire flood rental loss and acts of terrorism we also currently carry earthquake insurance on all of our properties in california and environmental insurance on most of our properties all of these policies contain coverage limitations we believe these coverages are of the types and amounts customarily obtained for or by an owner of similar types of real property assets located in the areas where our properties are located we intend to obtain similar insurance coverage on subsequently acquired properties 

the availability of insurance coverage may decrease and the prices for insurance may increase as a consequence of significant losses incurred by the insurance industry as a result we may be unable to renew or duplicate our current insurance coverage in adequate amounts or at reasonable prices in addition insurance companies may no longer offer coverage against certain types of losses such as losses due to terrorist acts and toxic mold or if offered the expense of obtaining these types of insurance may not be justified we therefore may cease to have insurance coverage against certain types of losses andor there may be decreases in the limits of insurance available if an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insured limits occurs we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property but still remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property we cannot guarantee that material losses in excess of insurance proceeds will not occur in the future if any of our properties were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt seriously our operations delay revenue and result in large expenses to repair or rebuild the property also due to inflation changes in codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors it may not be feasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a building after it has been damaged or destroyed events such as these could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations including distributions to our shareholders 

we may have limited flexibility in dealing with our jointly owned investments 

our organizational documents do not limit the amount of funds that we may invest in properties and assets jointly with other persons or entities and as of february 28 2006 excluding our joint venture with clarion lion properties fund we hold eight shopping centers and five urban retail and mixeduse properties jointly with other persons we may make additional joint investments in the future our existing and future joint investments may subject us to special risks including the possibility that our partners or coinvestors might become bankrupt that those partners or coinvestors might have economic or other business interests or goals which are unlike or incompatible with our business interests or goals and that those partners or coinvestors might be in a position to take action contrary to our suggestions or instructions or in opposition to our policies or objectives although we hold the managing general partnership or membership interest in all of our existing coinvestments as of february 28 2006 we must obtain the consent of the coinvestor or meet defined criteria to sell or to finance five of these properties joint ownership gives a third party the opportunity to influence the return we can achieve on some of our investments and may adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our shareholders we may also be liable for the actions of our coinvestors 

in addition on july 1 2004 we entered into a new joint venture with affiliates of clarion lion properties fund for purposes of acquiring properties although we are the managing general partner of that entity we have only a 30 ownership interest in that entity our partner’s consent is required to take certain actions with respect 

  

to the properties acquired by the venture and as a result we may not be able to take actions that we believe are necessary or desirable to protect or increase the value of the property or the property’s income stream pursuant to the terms of our partnership we must obtain our partner’s consent to do the following 

 

  

  

 the terms of our partnership require that certain acquisition opportunities be presented first to the joint venture which limits our ability to acquire properties for our own account which could in turn limit our ability to grow our investment in this joint venture is also subject to the risks described above for jointly owned investments as of december 31 2005 this joint venture owned four properties 

environmental laws and regulations could reduce the value or profitability of our properties 

all real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations relating to hazardous materials environmental protection and human health and safety under various federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations we and our tenants may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances released on or in properties we own or operate and also may be required to pay other costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances this liability may be imposed without regard to whether we or our tenants knew about the release of these types of substances or were responsible for their release the presence of contamination or the failure properly to remediate contamination at any of our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease those properties or to borrow funds by using those properties as collateral the costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate we are not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business assets or results of operations taken as a whole the uses of any of our properties prior to our acquisition of the property and the building materials used at the property are among the propertyspecific factors that will affect how the environmental laws are applied to our properties if we are subject to any material environmental liabilities the liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations 

we cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on the properties in the future compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems our tenants like many of their competitors have incurred and will continue to incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs associated with complying with these laws and regulations which will adversely affect their potential profitability 

generally our tenants must comply with environmental laws and meet remediation requirements our leases typically impose obligations on our tenants to indemnify us from any compliance costs we may incur as a result of the environmental conditions on the property caused by the tenant if a lease does not require compliance or if a tenant fails to or cannot comply we could be forced to pay these costs if not addressed environmental conditions could impair our ability to sell or release the affected properties in the future or result in lower sales prices or rent payments 

the americans with disabilities act of 1990 could require us to take remedial steps with respect to existing or newly acquired properties 

our existing properties as well as properties we may acquire as commercial facilities are required to comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act of 1990 investigation of a property may reveal noncompliance with this act the requirements of this act or of other federal state or local laws also may 

  

change in the future and restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to access for disabled persons future compliance with this act may require expensive changes to the properties 

the revenues generated by our tenants could be negatively affected by various federal state and local laws to which they are subject 

we and our tenants are subject to a wide range of federal state and local laws and regulations such as local licensing requirements consumer protection laws and state and local fire lifesafety and similar requirements that affect the use of the properties the leases typically require that each tenant comply with all regulations failure to comply could result in fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants or restrictions on the ability to conduct business on such properties noncompliance of this sort could reduce our revenues from a tenant could require us to pay penalties or fines relating to any noncompliance and could adversely affect our ability to sell or lease a property 

failure to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes would cause us to be taxed as a corporation which would substantially reduce funds available for payment of distributions 

we believe that we are organized and qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes and currently intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” however we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as such in the future 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions and applicable income tax regulations that have been issued under the code certain facts and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit for example in order to qualify as a reit at least 95 of our gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying rents and other income satisfying this requirement could be difficult for example if defaults by tenants were to reduce the amount of income from qualifying rents also we must make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains in addition new legislation new regulations new administrative interpretations or new court decisions may significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 

if we fail to qualify as a reit 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 we may be required to incur additional debt to qualify as a reit 

as a reit we must make annual distributions to shareholders of at least 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains we are subject to income tax on amounts of undistributed reit taxable income and net capital gain in addition we would be subject to a 4 excise tax if we fail to distribute sufficient income to meet a minimum distribution test based on our ordinary income capital gain and aggregate undistributed income from prior years 

  

we intend to make distributions to shareholders to comply with the code’s distribution provisions and to avoid federal income and excise tax we may need to borrow funds to meet our distribution requirements because 

 

  

 in these circumstances we might have to borrow funds on unfavorable terms and we may have to borrow funds even if our management believes the market conditions make borrowing financially unattractive 

to maintain our status as a reit we limit the amount of shares any one shareholder can own 

the code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a reit for example not more than 50 in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned actually or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to protect our reit status our declaration of trust prohibits any one shareholder from owning actually or constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares or of any class or series of outstanding preferred shares the constructive ownership rules are complex shares of our capital stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals andor entities may be treated as constructively owned by one of those individuals or entities as a result the acquisition of less than 98 in value of the outstanding common shares andor a class or series of preferred shares or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns common shares or preferred shares by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another to own constructively more than 98 in value of the outstanding stock if that happened either the transfer or ownership would be void or the shares would be transferred to a charitable trust and then sold to someone who can own those shares without violating the 98 ownership limit 

the board of trustees may waive these restrictions on a casebycase basis in addition the board of trustees and twothirds of our shareholders eligible to vote at a shareholder meeting may remove these restrictions if they determine it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the 98 ownership restrictions may delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change of our control that might involve a premium price for the common shares or otherwise be in the shareholders’ best interest 

we cannot assure you we will continue to pay dividends at historical rates 

our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at historical rates or to increase our common share dividend rate and our ability to pay preferred share dividends and service our debt securities will depend on a number of factors including among others the following 

 

  

  

  

 if we do not maintain or increase the dividend rate on our common shares it could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares and other securities any preferred shares we may offer in the future may have a fixed dividend rate that would not increase with any increases in the dividend rate of our common shares conversely payment of dividends on our common shares may be subject to payment in full of the dividends on any preferred shares and payment of interest on any debt securities we may offer 

  

certain tax and antitakeover provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control 

certain provisions contained in our declaration of trust and bylaws and the maryland general corporation law as applicable to maryland reits may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us if this were to happen it could delay deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management these provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over thenprevailing market prices these provisions include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition if we elect to be governed by it in the future the maryland control share acquisition law could delay or prevent a change in control under maryland law unless a reit elects not to be subject to this law “control shares” acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by shareholders by a vote of twothirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding shares owned by the acquirer and by officers or trustees who are employees of the reit “control shares” are voting shares that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing trustees within specified ranges of voting power a “control share acquisition” means the acquisition of control shares with some exceptions 

our bylaws state that the maryland control share acquisition law will not apply to any acquisition by any person of our common shares this bylaw provision may be repealed in whole or in part at any time whether before or after an acquisition of control shares by a vote of a majority of the shareholders entitled to vote and upon such repeal may to the extent provided by any successor bylaw apply to any prior or subsequent control share acquisition 

we may amend or revise our business policies without your approval and we have adopted a business plan that involves changes in our operational policies 

our board of trustees may amend or revise our operating policies without shareholder approval our investment financing and borrowing policies and policies with respect to all other activities such as growth debt capitalization and operations are determined by the board of trustees the board of trustees may amend or revise these policies at any time and from time to time at its discretion a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities 

the current business plan adopted by our board of trustees focuses on our investment in neighborhood and community shopping centers principally through redevelopments and acquisitions if this business plan is not successful it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forwardlooking statements that we make including those in this annual report on form 10k except as may be required by law we make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements as a result of new information future events or otherwise you should carefully review the above risks and the risk factors

none 




 item 2 properties 

general 

as of december 31 2005 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in 103 community and neighborhood shopping centers and retail mixedused properties comprising approximately 176 million square feet located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the northeast and midatlantic united states as well as california in addition we own one apartment complex in maryland no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2005 total revenue or net income we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

we operate our business on an asset management model where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we have divided our portfolio of properties into two operating regions the east and west each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager with dedicated leasing property management and financial staff and operates largely autonomously with respect to daytoday operating decisions 

tenant diversification 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 2200 leases ranging from sole proprietors to major national retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 25 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2005 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to any recent and future bankruptcy filing in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant 

  

geographic diversification 

our 104 properties are located in 12 states and the district of columbia the following table shows by region and state within the region the number of properties the gross leasable area and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area in each state as of december 31 2005 

 

 leases lease terms and lease expirations 

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on the level of sales achieved by tenants and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs caused by inflation and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rental rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on residential units are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2005 represented approximately 19 of total revenues 

  

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2005 for i each of the 10 years beginning with 2006 and ii after 2015 in the aggregate in both cases assuming that none of the tenants exercise future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2005 

 

 retail and residential properties 

the following table sets forth information concerning all properties in which we own an equity interest or have a leasehold interest and are consolidated as of december 31 2005 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail properties principal tenants are the largest tenants in the property based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a property’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are currently a party to various legal proceedings we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters either individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties currently we have two matters expected to go to trial this year based on the facts of these matters and advice from our legal counsel we believe that we will prevail in both matters if however we are unsuccessful in our defense of either of these matters there is a possibility that there will be a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in which we would pay the damages awarded in any adverse judgment also under our leases tenants are typically obligated to indemnify us from and against all liabilities costs and expenses imposed upon or asserted against us 1 as owner of the properties due to certain matters relating to the operation of the properties by the tenant and 2 where appropriate due to certain matters relating to the ownership of the properties prior to their acquisition by us 




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of shareholders 

no matters were submitted to a vote of our shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended december 31 2005

 item 5 market for our common equity and related shareholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities tableend our common shares trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol “frt” listed below are the high and low closing prices of our common shares as reported on the new york stock exchange and the dividends declared for each of the periods indicated 

 

  on february 27 2006 there were 4705 holders of record of our common shares 

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our reit taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income excluding net capital gain state income taxes are not material to our operations or cash flows 

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our annual dividend rate for 38 consecutive years 

our total annual dividends paid per share for 2005 and 2004 were 2320 per share and 1975 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2006 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under code sec 857b3 to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains for 2005 and 2004 a portion of our distributions was designated as capital gain dividend 

  

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions per share paid to common shareholders 

 

 distributions on our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares are payable at the rate of 2125 per share per annum prior to distributions on our common shares we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 

recent sales of unregistered shares 

all equity securities sold by us during 2005 that were not registered have been previously reported in a quarterly report on form 10q 

  




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in “item 8 financial statements and supplementary data” of this report 

overview 

we are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership management development and redevelopment of retail and mixeduse properties as of december 31 2005 we owned or had a majority interest in 103 community and neighborhood shopping centers and mixeduse properties comprising approximately 176 million square feet our properties are located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities in strategic metropolitan markets in the midatlantic and northeast regions of the united states as well as in california and one apartment complex in maryland in total the 103 commercial properties were 963 leased at december 31 2005 a joint venture in which we own a 30 interest owned four neighborhood shopping centers totaling approximately 05 million square feet as of december 31 2005 in total the joint venture properties in which we own an interest were 974 leased at december 31 2005 we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our dividends per common share for 38 consecutive years 

  

critical accounting policies 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which we refer to as gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates a discussion of possible risks which may affect these estimates is included in “item 1a risk factors” of this report management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate or accrual results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

the most significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

leases with tenants are classified as operating leases substantially all such leases contain fixed escalations which occur at specified times during the term of the lease base rents are recognized on a straightline basis from when the tenant controls the space through the term of the related lease net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to base rents straightline rents expense reimbursements and other revenue or income taking into account our expertise in the retail sector tenant credit information both internally and externally available payment history industry trends tenant creditworthiness and remaining lease terms in some cases primarily relating to straightline rents the collection of these amounts extends beyond one year the extended collection period for straightline rents along with our evaluation of tenant credit risk may result in the nonrecognition of a portion of straightline rental income until the collection of such income is reasonably assured these estimates have a direct impact on our net income historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 10 and 15 of rental income and it was 05 in 2005 an increase in our bad debt expense would decrease our net income for example if we had experienced an increase in bad debt of 05 of rental income in 2005 our net income would have been reduced by approximately 20 million 

real estate 

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers and mixeduse properties means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our properties constitute substantial costs for the trust as well as the industry as a whole the trust capitalizes real estate investments and depreciates them in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives the cost of our real estate investments less salvage value if any is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the asset using straightline rates for financial statement purposes we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors a newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings estimating the useful lives of assets that are longlived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation charged to that asset in a fiscal period will be which in turn will increase our net income similarly having a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

  

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost we compute depreciation using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15 years certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to operating expense if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced 

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of sfas no 13 these estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis these assessments have a direct impact on net income certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge against both the current and future revenues we periodically review the lives of assets and any decrease in asset lives could have the effect of increasing depreciation expense while any analysis indicating that lives are longer than we have assumed could have the effect of decreasing depreciation expense in order to determine the impact on depreciation expense of a different average life of our real estate assets taken as a whole we used 25 years which is the approximate average life of all assets being depreciated at the end of 2005 if the estimated useful lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year the consolidated annual depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately 32 million 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

real estate acquisitions 

upon acquisition of operating real estate properties we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting of land building and improvements identified intangible assets and liabilities consisting of above and belowmarket leases inplace leases and tenant relationships and assumed debt in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 141 business combinations based on these estimates we allocate the purchase price to the applicable assets and liabilities we utilize methods similar to those used by independent appraisers in estimating the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities we evaluate the useful life of each amortizable intangible asset each reporting period and account for any changes in such estimated useful life over the revised remaining useful life 

  

longlived assets 

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will be determined over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or developed management must evaluate properties for possible impairment of value and for those properties where impairment may be indicated make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over very long periods because our properties typically have a very long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment 

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” sfas no 144 requires that one accounting model be used for longlived assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newlyacquired and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity as a result the sale of a property or the classification of a property as held for sale requires us to report the results of operations and cash flows of that property as “discontinued operations” 

we are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining whether there is an impairment of an asset actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

contingencies 

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the likelihood and amount of any potential loss relating to these matters 

any difference between our estimate of a potential loss and the actual outcome would result in a reduction to net income if the actual loss is greater than our estimate in addition we reserve for estimated losses if any associated with warranties given to a buyer at the time an asset is sold or other potential liabilities relating to that sale taking any insurance policies into account these warranties may extend up to ten years and the calculation of potential liability requires significant judgment any increases to our estimated warranty losses would usually result in a decrease in net income 

selfinsurance 

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts per claim and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we currently do not maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuary valuations and future increases in costs of claims when making these determinations if our liability costs exceed these accruals it will reduce our net income 

new accounting pronouncement 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123r “sharebased payments” we are required to adopt sfas no 123r on january 1 2006 sfas 123r is similar to the fairvalue approach permitted by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensations” however 123r requires all sharebased awards to employees including grants of stock options to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values pro forma disclosures which we have previously provided as permitted by 123 are no longer an alternative 

  

effective january 1 2006 we will adopt 123r using the modified prospective approach the modified prospective approach requires the recognition of compensation cost for sharebased awards based on the grant date fair value from the beginning for the fiscal period in which the provisions of 123r are first applied measurement and recognition of compensation costs for sharebased awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of the date 123r is adopted are based on the same method used previously under sfas 123 sharebased awards granted modified or settled after 123r is adopted will be measured and recognized in the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of 123r 

we have used the blackscholes model to calculate the fair value of options under 123 and intend to continue to utilize this model to compute the fair value of options under 123r upon the adoption of 123r we expect to recognize a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle which will increase net income by approximately 2 million this cumulative effect is related to certain performance shares issued to certain officers and employees in 2002 and 2003 that were required to be adjusted to fair value at each reporting date under apb no 25 because the ultimate number of these shares that will vest is dependent on the achievement of certain performance targets under 123r these performance awards are accounted for based on their grantdate fair value and are not adjusted to fair value at each reporting date 

while there are certain differences between 123 and 123r we believe that our pro forma disclosures under 123 approximate the effect of 123r other than the cumulative effect of adoption discussed above we do not believe that the adoption of 123r will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

property acquisitions and dispositions 

a summary of our significant acquisitions in 2005 and 2004 is as follows 

 

 generally our acquisitions are initially financed by available cash and borrowings under our revolving credit facility which may be repaid later with funds raised through the issuance of new equity or new longterm debt additionally on december 29 2005 we assumed a 223 million mortgage in connection with the acquisition of crow canyon commons as discussed further below 

the assembly squaresturtevant street acquisition includes a 332000 square foot enclosed mall in the city of somerville massachusetts for which the redevelopment into a power center is nearly complete and an adjacent tenacre 220000 square foot retailindustrial complex as of december 31 2005 we have invested a total of 1034 million in the property and we expect to invest approximately 35 million more to complete the redevelopment of the power center 

the acquisition of assembly square also included zoning entitlements to add four mixeduse buildings on 35 acres which could include approximately 41000 square feet of retail space 51000 square feet of office space and 239 residential units the acquisition also included an option to purchase adjacent land parcels all of which are zoned for dense mixeduse development we expect that we will structure any future development of assembly square in a manner designed to mitigate our risk which may include selling entitlements or codeveloping with other real estate companies 

  

a summary of our significant dispositions in 2005 and 2004 is as follows 

 

   the proceeds from our dispositions were used to pay down our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 

2005 financing developments 

on december 2 2005 we issued 125 million of fixed rate notes which mature in june 2016 and bear interest at 565 the proceeds of this note offering were used to pay down our revolving credit facility including amounts drawn to pay off our 6625 notes due december 2005 

on december 29 2005 in connection with the acquisition of crow canyon commons we assumed a mortgage note with an approximate outstanding balance of 223 million this note requires monthly installment payments bears interest at 54 and matures in july 2013 

outlook 

general 

we anticipate our 2006 income from continuing operations to grow in comparison to our 2005 income from continuing operations we expect this income growth primarily to be generated by a combination of the following 

 

  

 we continue to see a positive impact on our income as a result of the redevelopment of our shopping centers and higher rental rates on existing spaces that are experiencing tenant turnover in 2006 and 2007 we anticipate that over 700000 square feet of retail space that has been under redevelopment will stabilize as redevelopment properties stabilize spaces that were out of service begin generating revenue in addition spaces that were not 

  

out of service and that have expiring leases may generate higher revenue because we generally receive higher rent on new leases further leases signed in 2004 and 2005 on spaces for which there was a previous tenant have on average been renewed at double digit base rent increases many of the leases with rents commencing in 2006 were signed in 2005 or earlier on spaces where the tenant leases are expiring in 2006 our analysis of current market rents as compared to rents on the existing leases leads us to expect that the base rents in new leases will have doubledigit average increases over the base rents currently in place 

at december 31 2005 the leaseable square feet in our shopping centers was 939 occupied and 963 leased the leased rate is higher than the occupancy rate due to spaces that are being redeveloped or improved or that are awaiting permits and therefore are not yet ready to be occupied we believe that our occupancy rate will improve slightly in 2006 as tenants take possession of leased spaces particularly in centers being redeveloped but that our occupancy rate will always be below our leased rate as leased spaces are prepared for occupancy our occupancy and leased rates are subject to variability over time due to acquisitions and the timing of the start and stabilization of our redevelopment projects 

santana row 

santana row located in san jose california includes approximately 563000 square feet of retail space 292 residential rental units and a ground lease to a 213room hotel the 292 residential rental units include 256 units that are being constructed and are expected to be complete in early to mid2006 and 36 existing rental units the 292 residential rental units do not include 219 units that have been sold as condominiums or are currently classified as held for sale our total investment in santana row as currently under development is anticipated to be 432 million which includes the 563000 square feet of retail space the 292 residential rental units the related common areas and infrastructure and 11 million invested in restaurant ventures net of insurance proceeds received related to the 2002 fire and proceeds from the sale of the 219 residential units 

we are developing a master plan for the remaining parcels at santana row which comprise approximately 134 acres of land our entitlements consist of approximately 120000 square feet of retail space 690 residential units and a 191room hotel we are evaluating the feasibility of utilizing these entitlements in future development at santana row but there is no guaranty that we will ultimately pursue or complete any part of the development of the remaining parcels 

acquisitions 

we anticipate further growth in earnings from acquisitions of neighborhood and community shopping centers in our primary markets in the east and west regions as well as a reduction in earnings from selective dispositions any growth in earnings from acquisitions is contingent however on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative standards at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates also may affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price that must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to economically finance the property acquisitions 

results of operations 

same center 

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “same center” basis information provided on a same center basis is provided for only those properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and excludes properties for which significant development redevelopment or expansion occurred during either of the periods being compared and properties purchased during either of the periods being compared same center results further exclude any properties we have sold during or subsequent to the periods being compared 

  

our same centerbasis results of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the year ended december 31 2004 exclude properties under redevelopment and the following

 partially offset by 

 

 other property income other property income decreased 08 million or 81 to 96 million in 2005 compared to 104 million in 2004 included in other property income are items which although recurring tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period such as lease termination fees and temporary tenant income this decrease in other property income in 2004 is primarily the result of lower lease termination fees and lower parking revenue 

mortgage interest income interest on mortgage notes receivable increased 05 million or 93 to 54 million in 2005 compared to 49 million in 2004 this increase is due primarily to an increase in the weighted average effective interest rate on notes outstanding 

property expenses 

total property operating expenses decreased 31 million or 24 to 1247 million in 2005 compared to 1278 million in 2004 this decrease is due primarily to lower bad debt expense lower insurance premiums and writeoffs of fixed assets and deferred lease costs related to early lease terminations 

rental expenses rental expenses decreased 51 million or 57 to 851 million in 2005 compared to 902 million in 2004 this decrease is primarily due to the following

real estate taxes real estate tax expense increased 20 million or 54 to 396 million in 2005 compared to 375 million in 2004 this increase in 2005 is due largely to increased taxes of 15 million attributable to acquired properties and higher tax assessments for our properties 

property operating income 

property operating income increased 281 million or 109 to 2857 million in 2005 compared to 2576 million in 2004 income recognized from fire insurance proceeds attributable to rental income lost at santana row due to the august 2002 fire amounted to approximately 31 million in 2004 and was insignificant in 2005 excluding these proceeds property operating income increased 312 million 

this increase is due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

  

 same center property operating income increased 45 or 93 million in 2005 over 2004 this increase is primarily due to increased rental income associated with new leases and increased occupancy when redevelopment and expansion properties are included with same center results property operating income increased by 61 or 143 million in 2005 over 2004 

other 

other interest income other interest income increased 07 million to 22 million in 2005 compared to 15 million in 2004 this increase is due primarily to nonrecurring additional interest income from the early payoff of a 75 million note receivable in june 2005 

interest expense  interest expense increased 35 million or 41 to 886 million in 2005 compared to 851 million in 2004 this increase is primarily due to higher outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities which we used to finance acquisitions on an interim basis and higher interest rates on our variablerate debt gross interest costs in 2005 were 942 million compared to 902 million in 2004 capitalized interest amounted to 57 million and 51 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased by 17 million or 96 to 199 million in 2005 compared to 182 million in 2004 this increase resulted primarily from increased payroll and benefits 

  

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased 24 million or 27 to 895 million in 2005 compared to 871 million in 2004 this increase is primarily due to depreciation and amortization on properties acquired 

minority interests  income to minority partners increased 11 million to 52 million in 2005 compared to 42 million in 2004 this is the result of increased earnings at majorityowned real estate partnerships partially offset by a decrease in the interest held by the minority partners 

loss income from discontinued operations loss income from discontinued operations represents the operating loss or income of properties that have been disposed which is required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported loss of 14 million and income of 52 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively represent the operating loss income for the period during which we owned the properties sold in 2005 and 2004 

gain on sale of real estate the gain on sale of real estate increased 167 million to 307 million in 2005 compared to 141 million in 2004 each of the properties sold in 2005 and 2004 resulted in a gain

property revenues 

total revenues increased 396 million or 115 to 3854 million in 2004 compared to 3458 million in 2003 this increase is due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

  

 the percentage leased at our shopping centers increased to 951 at december 31 2004 compared to 931 at december 31 2003 due primarily to new leases signed at existing properties 

rental income  rental income consists primarily of minimum rent cost recoveries from tenants and percentage rent rental income increased 335 million or 100 to 3701 million in 2004 compared to 3365 million in 2003 due largely to the following

mortgage interest income interest on mortgage notes receivable increased 08 million to 49 million in 2004 compared to 41 million in 2003 this increase is due to higher principal balances on notes outstanding 

property expenses 

total property operating expenses increased 133 million or 116 to 1278 million in 2004 compared to 1144 million in 2003 this increase is due primarily to increased real estate tax assessments utility and maintenance costs and other operating costs incurred during 2004 as detailed below 

rental expenses rental expenses increased 94 million or 117 to 902 million in 2004 compared to 808 million in 2003 this increase is due primarily to the following 

 

  

  

  

   

as a result of these changes in rental expenses rental income and other property income rental expense as a percentage of rental income plus other property income increased from 236 in 2003 to 237 in 2004 

real estate taxes real estate tax expense increased 39 million or 116 to 375 million in 2004 compared to 337 million in 2003 this increase is due primarily to increased taxes of 28 million related to acquired and developed properties including santana row and higher tax assessments for our properties in the east 

property operating income 

property operating income increased 263 million or 114 to 2576 million in 2004 compared to 2313 million in 2003 income recognized from fire insurance proceeds attributable to rental income lost at santana row due to the august 2002 fire amounted to approximately 30 million and 80 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively excluding these proceeds property operating income increased 313 million this increase is due primarily to the following

other 

interest expense  interest expense increased 98 million or 131 to 851 million in 2004 compared to 753 million in 2003 this increase is almost entirely due to lower capitalization of interest and therefore higher interest expense as most of our properties under development particularly at santana row have been placed into service gross interest costs in 2004 were 902 million compared to 887 million in 2003 capitalized interest amounted to 51 million and 135 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased by 63 million or 537 to 182 million in 2004 compared to 118 million in 2003 this increase resulted primarily from costs of personnel and compliance with the requirements of sarbanesoxley 

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased 144 million or 198 to 871 million in 2004 from 727 million in 2003 this increase is due primarily to depreciation on completed developments same center property increases and on properties acquired 

minority interests  income to minority partners decreased 05 million or 107 to 42 million in 2004 from 47 million in 2003 this is the result of decreased earnings at majorityowned real estate partnerships primarily from a lower gain on the sale of real estate and a decrease in the interest held by minority partners 

income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that have been disposed which is required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported operating income of 52 million and 62 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively represent the operating income for the period during which we owned properties sold in 2003 and subsequent years 

  

gain on sale of real estate the gain on sale of real estate in 2004 decreased 60 million to 140 million in 2004 compared to 200 million in 2003 all of the properties sold in 2004 and 2003 resulted in gains 

segment results 

we operate our business on an asset management model where property management teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we manage our portfolio as two operating regions east and west property management teams consist of regional directors leasing agents development staff and financial personnel each of whom has responsibility for a distinct portfolio 

the following selected key segment data presented is for 2005 2004 and 2003 the results of operations of properties that have been subsequently sold are excluded from property operating income data in the following table in accordance with sfas no 144 

property operating income consists of rental income other property income and mortgage interest income less rental expenses and real estate taxes this measure is used internally to evaluate the performance of our regional operations and we consider it to be a significant measure 

 

 east 

the east region extends roughly from new england south through metropolitan washington dc and further south through virginia and north carolina this region also includes several properties in illinois and michigan as of december 31 2005 the east segment consisted of 70 properties 

total revenue in our east region increased 171 million or 57 in 2005 and 186 million or 66 in 2004 these increases are primarily attributable to increased rental rates and occupancy acquisitions and higher recoveries in 2005 related to increased snow removal costs growth in total revenue attributable to acquisitions was 29 million in 2005 and 98 million in 2004 the percentage leased was 97 96 and 94 at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the ratio of property operating income to total revenue was 713 693 and 694 in 2005 2004 and 2003 the improvement in this ratio in 2005 is due primarily to increased rental rates and occupancy and lower bad debt expense and insurance premiums partially offset by increased real estate taxes 

  

west 

the west region extends from texas to the west coast as of december 31 2005 34 of our properties including santana row were located in the west region 

total revenue in our west region increased 78 million or 94 in 2005 and 210 million or 336 in 2004 these increases are primarily attributable to growth in total revenue at santana row as additional phases are brought into service and the acquisition of westgate mall in the first quarter of 2004 these increases in rental revenue were partially offset by decreases in fire insurance proceeds of 31 million and 50 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the insurance proceeds were included in rental income as they relate largely to lost rents on delayed openings of the residential and retail units and rental concessions to tenants due to the august 2002 fire at santana row the percentage leased was 94 93 and 88 at december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the ratio of property operating income to total revenue was 637 579 and 558 in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the improvement in this ratio is due primarily to increased occupancy at santana row and decreased operating expenses resulting from leasing marketing and other startup activities related to santana row 

the overall return on investment in our west region is significantly less than the overall return on investment in our east region this is due primarily to the following factors 

 

  

  

 we expect that returns on investment in our west region will continue to rise as these projects come into service but that they will not necessarily rise to the same level of overall returns that are generated in our east region 

liquidity and capital resources 

due to the nature of our business and strategy we generally generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our shareholders in the form of dividends our status as a reit requires that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income including net capital gain each year as defined in the code 

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring trust expenditures nonrecurring trust expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders overall capital requirements in 2006 will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of development of future phases of existing properties 

our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisitions we expect to fund these through a combination of sources which we believe will be available to us including additional and replacement secured and unsecured borrowings issuance of additional equity joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions 

the cash needed to execute our strategy and invest in new properties as well as to pay our debt at maturity must come from one or more of the following sources 

 

  

  

   

it is management’s intention that we continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business as a result we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings we may from time to time seek to obtain funds by the following means 

 

  

  

 the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

 

  

  

 cash and cash equivalents were 86 million and 305 million at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively cash and cash equivalents are not a good indicator of our liquidity we have a 300 million revolving credit facility which we can utilize to initially finance the acquisition of properties and meet other shortterm working capital requirements this revolving credit facility matures in october 2006 however we have a oneyear extension option 

summary of cash flows for 2005 and 2004 

 

 net cash provided by operating activities increased by 03 million to 1744 million during the year ended december 31 2005 from 1741 million during the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily attributable to 

 

 mostly offset by 

 

   

net cash used in investing activities decreased approximately 54 million to 1522 million during the year ended december 31 2005 from 1576 million during the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease was primarily attributable to 

 

  

  

  

 partially offset by 

 

 net cash used in financing activities increased approximately 230 million to 440 million during the year ended december 31 2005 from 210 million during the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily attributable to

 offbalance sheet arrangements 

other than the joint venture funding commitments described in the next paragraph and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table below we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2005 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

in july 2004 we entered into a joint venture arrangement by forming a limited partnership with affiliates of clarion lion properties fund “clarion” a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners we own 30 of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70 the partnership plans to acquire up to 350 million of stabilized supermarketanchored shopping centers in the trust’s east and west regions federal realty and clarion have committed to contribute to the partnership up to 42 million and 98 million respectively of equity capital to acquire properties with a targeted investment date through june 2006 no assurances can be made that we will identify properties that meet the acquisition requirements of the partnership we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest in 2004 the venture acquired four shopping centers in the east for 758 million we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method in total at december 31 2005 the partnership had 472 million of mortgage notes outstanding 

  

contractual commitments 

the following table provides a summary of our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2005 

 

 in addition to the amounts set forth in the table above the following potential commitments exist 

a under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and after january 1 1986 an unaffiliated third party has the right to require us and the two other minority partners to purchase between onehalf to all of its 2947 interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2005 our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 40 million to 45 million 

b under the terms of two other partnerships which own properties in southern california with a cost of approximately 290 million if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships the other partners may require us to purchase their partnership interests at a formula price based upon property operating income the purchase price for one of the partnerships will be paid in cash and the purchase price for the other partnership will be paid using our common shares or subject to certain conditions cash in those partnerships if the other partners do not redeem their interests we may choose to purchase the limited partnership interests upon the same terms 

c street retail san antonio lp a wholly owned subsidiary of the trust entered into a development agreement the “agreement” in 2000 with the city of san antonio texas the “city” related to the redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along houston street under the agreement we are required to issue an annual letter of credit commencing on october 1 2002 and ending on september 30 2014 that covers our designated portion of the debt service should the incremental tax revenue generated in the zone not cover the debt service we posted a letter of credit with the city on september 25 2002 for 08 million and the letter of credit remains outstanding we estimate our total obligation under the agreement to be in the range of 16 million to 30 million in 2005 2004 and 2003 we funded approximately 03 million  04 million and 04 million respectively in anticipation of further shortfalls of incremental tax revenues to the city we have accrued approximately 04 million as of december 31 2005 to cover additional payments we may be obligated to make as part of the project costs prior to the expiration of the agreement on september 30 2014 we could be required to provide funding beyond the 04 million currently accrued however we do not anticipate that our obligation would exceed 06 million in any year or 3 million in total if the zone creates sufficient tax increment funding to repay the city’s debt prior to the expiration of the agreement we will be eligible to receive reimbursement of amounts paid for debt service shortfalls together with interest thereon 

d under the terms of various other partnership agreements for entities the partners have the right to exchange their operating units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option as of december 31 2005 a total of 420426 operating units are outstanding 

e in addition to our contractual obligations we have other shortterm liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including 

  

debt service relating to additional and replacement debt recurring corporate expenditures including compensation agreements nonrecurring corporate expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders in addition future rental commitments are not reflected as commitments until the underlying leased space has been delivered for use overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of future phases of santana row and assembly square 

f we are the guarantor for the “nonrecourse carve outs” under mortgage notes totaling 367 million that are secured by three properties owned by subsidiaries of our unconsolidated joint venture with affiliates of clarion lion properties fund a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners we are not guaranteeing the debt itself the joint venture indemnifies us for any loss we incur under these guarantees 

g upon completion on or around june 1 2006 we expect to take possession of approximately 37000 square feet of retail space under a capital lease the term of the capital lease is 99 years from the date of possession and requires annual cash payments of approximately 374000 and will be adjusted every 20 years based on the consumer price index and other factors 

debt financing arrangements 

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2005 

 

   

          our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial and other covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future as of december 31 2005 we were in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

  

below are the aggregate principal payments required as of december 31 2005 under our debt financing arrangements by year scheduled principal installments and amounts due at maturity are included 

 

 our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

   interest rate hedging 

we enter into interest rate swaps and treasury rate locks that qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” we generally enter into interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to variable interest rate risk and treasury locks to manage the risk of interest rates rising prior to the issuance of debt we do not purchase derivatives for speculation our cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value the effective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of our cash flow hedges is recognized in earnings in the period affected we assess effectiveness of our cash flow hedges both at inception and on an ongoing basis hedge ineffectiveness did not have a significant impact on earnings in 2005 2004 and 2003 and we do not anticipate it will have a significant effect in the future 

in january 2004 we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the libor portion of our 150 million term loan issued in october of 2003 this swap fixed the libor portion at 2401 through october 2006 the current interest rate on this term loan taking into account this swap is 3351 2401 plus 95 basis points and will remain at this rate through october 2006 assuming no change in our debt rating 

in august 2002 in anticipation of a 150 million senior unsecured note offering we entered into a treasury lock that fixed the five year treasury rate at 3472 through august 19 2002 on august 16 2002 we priced the senior unsecured notes with a scheduled closing date of august 21 2002 and closed on the associated rate lock fiveyear treasury rates declined between the pricing period and the settlement of the rate lock and therefore we paid 15 million to settle the rate lock as a result of the august 19 2002 fire at santana row we did not proceed with the note offering at that time however we consummated a 150 million 6125 senior unsecured note offering on november 2002 and thus the hedge loss is being amortized into interest expense over the life of these notes 

we also purchased an interest rate swap that terminates march 2006 with a notional amount of 405 million upon issuance of our 699 medium term notes which reduced the effective interest rate from 699 to 6894 

  

reit qualification 

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes on income we distribute to our shareholders as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute 90 of our reit taxable income including net capital gain to our shareholders 

funds from operations 

funds from operations “ffo” is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

 

  

  

 we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gain to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

the reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows 

 

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements 

we also enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counter party to our interest rate swap used to fix the libor portion of our 150 million term loan the counterparty of this swap has a longterm debt rating of “a” by standard and poor’s rating service and “a1” by moody’s investor service as of december 31 2005 

interest rate risk 

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for our variable rate debt and on the fair value of our total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management might take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

fixed interest rate debt 

the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2028 or through 2077 including capital lease obligations have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of fluctuating interest rates interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments however at december 31 2005 we had 12 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2005 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 452 million if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2005 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 520 million 

variable interest rate debt 

we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2005 we had 1649 million of variable rate debt outstanding based upon this amount of variable rate debt if interest rates increased 10 our annual interest expense would increase by approximately 16 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 16 million conversely if interest rates decreased 10 our annual interest expense would decrease by approximately 16 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately 16 million

internal control over financial reporting 

establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and executive vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles this process includes policies and procedures that 

 

   

  

 limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been or will be detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

scope of the evaluations 

the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of procedures and our internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee independent public accountants and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our 

  

independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 2 a “significant deficiency” is a “control deficiency” or a combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with gaap such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected a “control deficiency” exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 2 as a significant deficiency or a combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report

business objectives and strategies 

  

our primary business objective is to own manage acquire and redevelop a portfolio of commercial retail properties with the dominant property type being grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers that will 

  

   

   

   

   

our traditional focus has been on grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers late in 1994 recognizing a trend of increased consumer acceptance and retailer expansion to main streets we expanded our investment strategy to include “street retail” and “mixeduse” properties the mixeduse properties are typically centered around a retail component but may also include office residential and hotel components in established main street shopping areas in addition from 1997 through 2001 we undertook the groundup development in urban areas of mixeduse projects that center around the retail component in 2002 our board of trustees approved the adoption of a business plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of owning managing acquiring and redeveloping high quality retail properties in our core markets 

  

operating strategies 

  

our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants and replacing weaker underperforming tenants with stronger ones our properties are generally located in some of the most densely 

  

populated and affluent areas of the country in addition because of the infill nature of our locations our centers generally face less competition per capita than centers owned by our peers these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates charge higher rental rates and maintain steady rent growth all of which increases the value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

investing strategies 

  

our investment strategy calls for deploying capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for future net income growth equal to or in excess of the historical net income growth of our core portfolio of properties 

  

our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories 

  

   

   

   

   

investment criteria 

  

when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion and acquisition opportunities we consider such factors as 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

financing strategies 

  

our financing strategies are designed to enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet while retaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most costefficient way possible our financing strategies include 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

employees 

  

at december 31 2004 we had 262 fulltime employees and 140 parttime employees none of the employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

  

tax status 

  

we elected to be taxed as a reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 1962 as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on reit taxable income that 

  

we distribute to our shareholders under the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we prefer as to the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of reit taxable income we will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed reit taxable income in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to federal state and local income taxes 

  

governmental regulations affecting our properties 

  

we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the application of these laws to a specific property that we own depends on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the former uses of the property the building materials used at each property and the physical layout of the property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of properties currently or previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral 

  

neither existing environmental health safety and similar laws nor the costs of our compliance with these laws has had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and management does not believe they will in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on properties we currently own or may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties 

  

competition 

  

numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us with respect to the tenant leasing and the acquisition of properties some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although no single competitor or group of competitors in any of the primary markets where our properties are located is believed to be dominant in that market this competition may 

  

   

   

   

   

   

retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

 item 2 properties 

  

general 

  

as of december 31 2004 we owned or had a majority ownership interest in 106 community and neighborhood shopping centers and retail mixedused properties comprising approximately 169 million square feet located primarily in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the northeast and midatlantic united states as well as california in addition we own one apartment complex in maryland no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2004 total revenue or net income we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits 

  

we operate our business on an asset management model where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we have divided our portfolio of properties into two operating regions the east and west each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager with dedicated leasing property management and financial staff and operates largely autonomously with respect to daytoday operating decisions 

  

tenant diversification 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 2200 tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 23 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2004 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to recent and future bankruptcy filings in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant 

  

geographic diversification 

  

our 107 properties are located in 14 states and the district of columbia the following table shows by region and state within the region the number of properties the gross leasable area and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area in each state as of december 31 2004 

  

   

leases lease terms and lease expirations 

  

our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to require the monthly payment of minimum rents in advance subject to periodic increases during the term of the lease percentage rents based on our tenants’ gross sales volumes and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs caused by inflation and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales 

  

commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer many of our leases contain tenant options that enable the tenant to extend the term of the lease at expiration at preestablished rates that often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent leases on apartments are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2004 represented approximately 32 of total revenues 

  

the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2004 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2005 assuming that none of the tenants exercise their future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2004 

  

   

retail and residential properties 

  

the following table sets forth information concerning all properties in which we own an equity interest or have a leasehold interest and are consolidated as of december 31 2004 except as otherwise noted we are the sole owner of our retail properties principal tenants are the largest tenants in the property based on square feet leased or are tenants important to a property’s success due to their ability to attract retail customers

our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our reit taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income state income taxes are not material to our operations or cash flows 

  

future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our annual dividend rate for 37 consecutive years 

  

our total annual dividends paid per share for 2004 and 2003 were 1975 per share and 1945 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from dividends as calculated for federal income tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of increasing the amount of gain or reducing the amount of loss recognized upon the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2005 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under code sec 857b3 to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains for 2004 a portion of our distributions was designated as a capital gain dividend 

  

recent sales of unregistered shares 

  

during 2004 and 2003 we issued 123130 and 76952 common shares respectively upon the redemption of operating partnership units held by persons who received units in earlier periods in exchange for contribution of real estate to limited partnerships that we control the common shares were issued without registration under the securities act of 1933 in reliance on section 42 of that act 

  

in 2005 we issued 190000 common shares without registration under the securities act of 1933 in reliance on section 42 of that act upon the redemption of operating partnership units we intend to ultimately register these shares under the securities act of 1933 

  

the following table reflects the income tax status of distributions paid during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 to common shareholders 

  

   

distributions on our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares are payable at the rate of 2125 per share per annum prior to distributions on our common shares our 795 series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares paid distributions at a rate of 19875 per share per annum and were redeemed in full in june 2003 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit

critical accounting policies 

  

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which we refer to as gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by 

  

management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if changes in the estimate or accrual results could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 

  

the most significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows 

  

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

  

leases with tenants are classified as operating leases base rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related leases net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to base rents including receivables from recording rent on a straightline basis expense reimbursements and other revenue or income taking into account payment history industry trends and the period of recovery in doing so we generally do not recognize income from straightline rents due to be collected beyond ten years because of uncertainty of collection in most cases the ultimate collectibility of these claims extends beyond one year these estimates have a direct impact on our net income historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 10 and 15 of rental income and was 15 in 2004 an increase in our bad debt expense would decrease our net income for example if we had experienced an increase in bad debt of 05 of rental income in 2004 our net income would have been reduced by approximately 19 million 

  

real estate 

  

the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers means that we invest significant amounts of capital depreciation and maintenance costs relating to our shopping centers and mixeduse properties constitutes a substantial cost for the trust as well as the industry as a whole the trust capitalizes real estate investments and depreciates it in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives the cost of our real estate investments less salvage value if any is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the asset using straightline rates for financial statement purposes we periodically review the estimated lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to these estimates and therefore to our depreciation rates these reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets the cost of redevelopments that may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors a newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings estimating the useful lives of assets that are longlived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment the longer the economic useful life the lower the depreciation charged to that asset in a fiscal period will be which in turn will increase our net income similarly using a shorter economic useful life would increase the depreciation for a fiscal period and decrease our net income 

  

land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost depreciation is computed using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15 years certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the capitalized costs associated with developments and redevelopments are depreciated over the life of the improvement capitalized costs associated with leases are depreciated or amortized over the base term of the lease unamortized leasing costs are charged to 

  

operations if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced 

  

when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of sfas no 13 these estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 

  

we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis these assessments have a direct impact on net income certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge against both the current and future revenues we will continue to periodically review the lives of assets and any decrease in asset lives could have the effect of increasing depreciation expense while any analysis indicating that lives are longer than we have assumed could have the effect of decreasing depreciation expense in order to determine the impact on depreciation expense of a different average life of our real estate assets taken as a whole we used 25 years which is the approximate average life of all assets being depreciated at the end of 2004 if the estimated useful lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year the consolidated depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately 32 million 

  

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period 

  

longlived assets 

  

there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties that have been acquired or developed management must evaluate properties for possible impairment of value and for those properties where impairment may be indicated make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over very long periods because our properties typically have a very long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment 

  

in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” effective for us on january 1 2002 sfas no 144 requires that one accounting model be used for longlived assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newlyacquired and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity as a result the sale of a property or the classification of a property as held for sale requires us to report the results of operations and cash flows of that property as “discontinued operations” 

  

we are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining whether there is an impairment of an asset actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 

  

contingencies 

  

we are sometimes involved in lawsuits and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the amount and likelihood of loss relating to these matters the estimates and assumptions relating to potential loss result in a decrease in net income 

  

selfinsurance 

  

we are selfinsured for general liability costs up to predetermined retained amounts and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability we maintain third party stoploss insurance policies to cover liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts our accrual for selfinsurance liability is determined by management and is based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported management considers a number of factors including thirdparty actuary valuations when making these determinations if our liability costs exceed these accruals it will reduce our net income

also in january 2004 to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our 150 million term loan obtained in october 2003 we entered into an interest rate swap which fixed the libor portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2401 through october 2006 the term loan bears interest at libor plus 95 basis points 095 the interest rate on the term note was 21 as of december 31 2003 the current interest rate taking into account the swap is 3351 2401 plus 095 on notional amounts totaling 150 million and is 295 without the swap

outlook 

  

we believe that in 2005 we will experience growth in earnings from operations when compared to 2004 we expect this growth in earnings to be generated by a combination of the following 

  

   

   

   

   

our earnings in 2003 and 2004 were positively impacted by the reimbursement to us of lost rents of 110 million from an insurance settlement received in december 2003 related to a fire at santana row in 2002 of the 11 million reimbursement approximately 8 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2003 and approximately 3 million was recognized during 2004 

  

earnings in our same center portfolio are anticipated to grow as a recovering economy in each of our regions is expected to result in improved occupancy rates and increasing rents on lease rollovers please see “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—results of operations—same center” below for the definition of the properties that constitute our “same center” portfolio the economic environment in the northern california retail market while improving continues to be weak resulting in lower occupancy rates and limiting our ability to increase rents in properties in that area we believe the economies of our other markets are generally improving our same center growth has also been slowed during the past two fiscal years by the increase in our redevelopment activity at certain centers which will by design keep leasable space out of service until the redevelopments are complete the competitive retail environment has resulted in the loss of some of our anchor retailers but we have been successful in replacing a number of those anchors and other weaker tenants with tenants that we believe are more credit worthy in other cases we have taken advantage of the opportunity to redevelop the space that became vacant when the anchor tenant vacated while this redevelopment and retenanting activity has resulted in increased capital investment in those centers it should also increase the rental income from new leases as these tenants commence operations add to the economic life of the centers and increase the appeal of the centers to retail customers these factors should extend the number of years during which we can reasonably expect growth in earnings from those properties beyond the period we would have expected if we had not made the additional capital investment 

  

the current development at santana row consists of four phases seven of the eight buildings of phase i which include retail residential and a 213room hotel opened in 2002 the retail portion of the remaining building “building 7” opened in early 2003 the delay in opening building 7 was the result of a fire in august 2002 that destroyed all but 11 of the planned 246 residential units located on that building the rebuilding of the residential rental units on building 7 phase iv commenced in 2004 we anticipate delivery of the units will start in 2005 and when completed in 2006 building 7 will add 96 townhomes and 160 flats phase ii of the project which includes approximately 84000 square feet of retail space was completed in late 2003 and phase iii which consists of an arts cinema and 4000 square feet of retail space opened in august 2004 the total cost of phase i is estimated to be 449 million excluding the building 7 reconstruction the costs to date for phase i are net of 129 million of insurance proceeds 11 million of which was recognized as income in 2004 and 2003 the cost of phase ii is approximately 27 million the total cost of phase iii is estimated to be approximately 5 million and we estimate the cost phase iv will be approximately 58 million we are exploring in 2005 the possibility of selling as many as 219 residential units at santana as condominiums in the event we determine it is financially feasible to sell residential units and we are able to obtain all necessary approvals sales of units could begin in mid2005 

  

the financial success of santana row will depend on many factors which cannot be assured these factors include among others 

  

   

   

   

   

we anticipate further growth in earnings from continuing investments in our primary markets in the east and west regions partly offset by selective dispositions we expect to continue growth through acquisition of neighborhood and community shopping centers in 2005 and beyond this growth is contingent however on our ability to find properties that meet our qualitative hurdles at prices that meet our financial hurdles changes in interest rates also may affect our success in achieving growth through acquisitions by affecting both the price which must be paid to acquire a property as well as our ability to finance the property acquisitions 

  

as one method of enhancing our growth and strengthening our market share in the regions in which we operate in july 2004 we entered into a joint venture arrangement by forming a limited partnership in which we own 30 of the equity the venture intends to acquire up to 350 million of stabilized supermarketanchored shopping centers in our east coast and west coast markets which will be financed through secured borrowings and equity contributions we will be the manager of the venture and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing through our partnership interest we also will have the opportunity to earn performancebased income 

  

results of operations 

  

same center 

  

throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “same center” basis information provided on a same center basis is provided for only those properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and includes properties for which redevelopment or expansion had been completed prior to the beginning of either of the periods being compared properties purchased or sold and properties under development at any time during the periods being compared are excluded 

  

our same centerbasis results of operations for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the year ended december 31 2003 exclude the four properties acquired in 2004 and the five properties acquired in 2003 respectively including westgate mall shaw’s plaza mount vernon plaza south valley shopping center plaza del mercado and mercer mall as well as the eight and ten dispositions in 2004 and 2003 respectively including magruder’s center plaza del mercado and other properties we also exclude properties under development in 2004 or 2003 primarily santana row 

  

on a same center basis results of operations for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 excludes the 10 properties sold in 2003 and the six properties sold in 2002 it also excludes properties under development in 2003 and 2002 including pentagon row and santana row 

  

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

  

   

property revenues 

  

total revenues in 2004 were 3943 million which represents an increase of 417 million or 118 over total revenues of 3526 million in 2003 the primary drivers of this increase are acquisitions santana row which was phased into service and an increase in same center revenues as a result of increased occupancy and increased rental revenue on tenant rollovers as detailed below in addition we experienced increased cost recoveries from our tenants attributable to higher operating costs at the properties 

  

the percentage leased at our shopping centers increased to 951 at december 31 2004 compared to 931 at yearend 2003 due primarily to new leases signed at existing properties 

  

rental income  rental income consists primarily of minimum rent percentage rent and cost recoveries from tenants of common area maintenance costs and real estate taxes rental income increased 338 million or 100 in 2004 versus 3381 million in 2003 due largely to the following 

  

   

   

   

other property income other property income increased 71 million or 682 to 175 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to 104 million for the year ended december 31 2003 included in other property income are items which although recurring tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period such as lease termination fees and temporary tenant income the increase in other property income in 2004 is primarily the result of higher lease termination fees parking revenue and income from our restaurant joint ventures 

  

mortgage interest income interest on mortgage notes receivable increased 08 million or 198 to 49 million 2004 versus 41 million in 2003 due to higher principal balances on notes outstanding 

  

property expenses 

  

total property operating expenses were 1299 million in 2004 which represents an increase of 135 million or 116 when compared to 1164 million in 2003 the increase in total expenses is due primarily to increased real estate tax assessments utility and maintenance costs and other operating costs incurred during 2004 as detailed below 

  

rental expense rental expense increased 93 million or 113 to 916 million in 2004 from 823 million in 2003 of this increase 

  

   

   

   

   

as a result of these changes in rental expenses rental income and other property income rental expense as a percentage of rental income plus other property income decreased from 236 in 2003 to 235 in 2004 

  

real estate taxes real estate tax expense rose 42 million or 122 to 383 million in 2004 compared to 341 million in 2003 the increase in 2004 is due largely to increased taxes of 28 million related to acquired and developed properties including santana row and higher tax assessments for our properties in the east 

  

property operating income property operating income was 2644 million for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 282 million or 119 compared to 2362 million in 2003 income recognized from fire insurance proceeds attributable to rental income lost at santana row due to the august 2002 fire amounted to approximately 30 million and 80 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively excluding these proceeds property operating income rose 331 million this increase is due primarily to 

  

   

   

   

same center property operating income rose 43 or approximately 94 million in 2004 this increase is primarily due to 

  

   

   

   

interest expense  interest expense rose 98 million or 131 to 851 million in 2004 compared to 753 million in 2003 this increase is almost entirely due to lower capitalization of interest and therefore higher interest expense as most of our property under development particularly at santana row has been placed into service gross interest costs in 2004 were 902 million versus 887 million in 2003 capitalized interest amounted to 51 million and 135 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

general and administrative expense administrative expenses increased by 63 million or 537 to 182 million in 2004 compared to 118 million in 2003 this increase resulted primarily from costs of personnel and compliance with sarbanesoxley 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses attributable to depreciation and amortization rose 152 million or 205 to 897 million in 2004 from 745 million in 2003 the increase is due to depreciation on developments same center increases and on new properties acquired 

  

other 

  

minority interests  income to minority owners decreased 05 million or 107 to 42 million in 2004 from 47 million in 2003 this is the result of increased earnings at properties owned in partnership offset by a decrease in the ownership percentage of several partnerships held by minority owners 

  

operating income from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that have been disposed of which under sfas no 144 are required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported operating income of 11 million and 32 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively represent the operating income for the period during which we owned the eight properties sold in 2004 and the ten properties sold in 2003 

  

gain on sale of real estate the gain on sale of real estate in 2004 decreased 60 million or 299 to 140 million from 200 million in 2003 none of the eight and ten properties sold in 2004 and 2003 respectively resulted in a loss

total revenues in 2003 were 3526 million which represents an increase of 425 million or 137 over total revenues of 3101 million in 2002 the primary drivers of this increase are santana row which has been phased into service acquisitions an increase in same center revenues from higher rent on tenant rollovers as detailed below and income of approximately 80 million from the portion of the settlement of our insurance claims for the august 2002 fire at santana row related to lost rent in addition we experienced increased cost recoveries related to higher operating costs 

  

the percentage leased at our shopping centers declined to 931 at december 31 2003 compared to 947 at year end 2002 due to the acquisition of centers with lower occupancy rates and the bankruptcies of several large tenants including kmart and today’s man as well as an increase in redevelopment activity which results in leaseable space being taken out of service for more extended periods 

  

rental income  rental income consists primarily of minimum rent percentage rent and cost recoveries from tenants of common area maintenance costs and real estate taxes rental income increased 423 million or 143 in 2003 versus 2002 due largely to the following 

  

   

   

   

other property income other property income decreased 02 million or 15 to 104 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 106 million for the year ended december 31 2002 included in other property income are items which although recurring tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period such as lease termination fees and temporary tenant income the decrease in other property income in 2003 is primarily the result of higher temporary tenant income offset by lower lease termination fees 

  

mortgage interest income mortgage interest income increased 03 million or 88 in 2004 verses 2003 

  

property expenses 

  

total property operating expenses in 2003 were 1164 million or an increase of 144 million when compared to 1020 million in 2002 the total increase in expenses is due primarily to higher real estate taxes increased maintenance costs related to snow removal in 2003 and the impact of acquisitions and developments as detailed below 

  

rental expense rental expense increased 105 million or 147 to 823 million in 2003 from 718 million in 2002 of this increase 

  

   

   

rental expense reductions related to disposed properties were not significant 

  

as a result of these changes in rental expenses rental income and other property income rental expense as a percentage of rental income plus other property income increased slightly from 234 in 2002 to 236 in 2003 

  

real estate taxes real estate tax expense rose 129 in 2003 to 341 million compared to 302 million in 2003 the increase in 2004 is due largely to higher tax assessments for our properties in the east as well as increased taxes of 18 million related to acquired and developed properties including santana row which was brought into service starting in late 2002 

  

property operating income property operating income was 2362 million for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 281 million compared to 2081 million in 2003 of this amount approximately 80 million relates to the santana row fire insurance proceeds attributable to rental income lost as a result of the fire excluding these proceeds property operating income rose 201 million during 2004 due primarily to 

  

   

   

   

same center property operating income rose 135 or 281 million in 2003 due to increased rental income associated with tenant rollovers and higher real estate tax recoveries and reduced property administrative expenses partly offset by property expenses which rose higher than the related recoveries particularly the snow removal costs 

  

interest expense  interest expense rose 102 million or 157 to 752 million in 2003 this increase is almost entirely due to lower capitalization of interest and therefore higher interest expense as much of our property under development particularly at santana row was placed into service gross interest costs in 2003 was 887 million versus 886 million in 2002 capitalized interest amounted to 135 million and 235 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

general and administrative expense administrative expenses decreased by 20 million during 2003 or 143 to 118 million compared to 138 million in 2002 this 20 million decrease resulted primarily from payroll and related benefits savings resulting from the management restructuring which began in february 2002 in addition we experienced savings in legal costs and costs to support and maintain our information systems these savings were largely offset by increased expensing of costs which had previously had been capitalized related to personnel involved in the development of santana row 

  

restructuring expense the restructuring expenses incurred in 2002 related to our adoption of a new business and management succession plan and resulted in a charge of 85 million all of which was expended in 2002 in december 2002 we recorded a charge of 138 million as a result of an accelerated executive transition plan of which 127 million was expended in 2003 

  

depreciation and amortization expenses attributable to depreciation and amortization rose 113 million to 745 million in 2003 from 632 million in 2002 an increase of 179 the increase is due to depreciation on properties which were acquired in 2003 as well as depreciation of santana row which opened in late 2002 and pentagon row which came fully into service during 2002 

  

other 

  

minority interests  the increase in income to minority interests of 06 million from 41 million in 2002 to 47 million in 2003 is the result of increased earnings at properties owned in partnership as well as an increase in the number of operating partnership units held by minority investors units which were issued in connection with our acquisition of mount vernon shopping center were partially offset by a decrease in units outstanding as a results of redemptions during the year 

  

operating income from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that have been disposed of which under sfas no 144 are required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported operating income of 32 million and 47 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively represent the operating income for the period during which we owned the ten properties sold in 2003 and the six properties sold in 2002 

  

loss on abandoned developments and gain on sale of real estate the gain on sale of real estate in 2003 was 201 million from the disposal of properties none of the properties sold in 2003 resulted in a loss the gain in 2002 of 191 million is the result of the sale of six properties the loss on abandoned developments in 2002 resulted from our change in business plan 

  

segment results 

  

we operate our business on an asset management model where property management teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets prior to june 30 2004 we divided our portfolio of properties into three operating regions northeast midatlantic and west 

  

beginning with the three months ended september 30 2004 we determined that our portfolio should be divided into two operating regions rather than three property management teams consisting of regional directors leasing agents development staff and financial personnel each have responsibility for a distinct portfolio the two regions into which we have divided our portfolio of properties are east and west as a result our segment information for prior periods has been recalculated by combining our northeast and midatlantic segments into the new east region 

  

the following selected key segment data presented is for the twelve months ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 except total assets and gross leasable area which are presented as of december 31 of each year the results of operations of properties that have been sold during the period from january 1 2004 to december 31 2004 are excluded from property operating income data in the following table in accordance with sfas no 144 

  

property operating income consists of rental income other property income and mortgage interest income less rental expenses and real estate taxes the measure is used internally to evaluate the performance of our regional operations and we consider it to be a significant measure 

  

   

east 

  

the east region extends roughly from new england south through metropolitan washington dc and further south through virginia and north carolina this region also includes several properties in florida illinois and michigan as of december 31 2004 the east segment consisted of 72 properties 

  

   

   

the ratio of property operating income to total revenue during the year ended december 31 2004 decreased slightly from the same period of 2003 due mainly to increased rental revenues and cost recoveries being more than offset by increased operating expenses primarily real estate tax expense the ratio of property operating 

  

income to total rental income during the year ended december 31 2003 decreased slightly from the same period of 2002 due mainly to a lower recovery rate on higher common area expenses particularly due to the snow removal costs incurred in the first quarter of 2003 

  

west 

  

the west region extends from texas to the west coast as of december 31 2004 35 of our properties including santana row were located in the west region 

  

total revenue in the west in 2004 increased 228 million to 911 million compared to 683 million in 2003 the increase in total revenue of 333 is largely attributable to increased rental revenue of 167 million primarily at santana row and from our acquisition of westgate mall and to increased other income including termination fees of 61 million the increase in rental revenue was partially offset by a decrease in insurance proceeds of approximately 50 million the insurance proceeds were reported as part of rental income as they relate largely to lost rents on the delayed opening of the residential and retail units and rental concessions to tenants due to the august 2002 fire at santana row 

  

total revenue in the west in 2003 increased 300 million or 782 to 683 million compared to 383 million in 2002 the increase in total revenue is largely attributable to increased total revenues at santana row of approximately 213 million in addition approximately 80 million of the rental income from the insurance proceeds received related to the fire at santana row was recorded in 2003 excluding the santana row revenue growth and the insurance proceeds total revenue growth in 2003 was 4 as higher income in san antonio texas and southern california more than offset lower revenue at our property at 150 post street in san francisco california 

  

for the west region the percentage leased was 93 88 and 84 at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the santana row development added approximately 558000 square feet of retail space to the west region since the end of 2001 the improved occupancy as of yearend 2004 compared to the end of 2003 is due largely to the acquisition of westgate mall and the leasing of additional space at santana row the improved occupancy as of yearend 2003 compared to the end of 2002 is due largely to increases at santana row and houston street in san antonio texas 

  

the west region’s property operating income margin to total revenue improved in 2004 over 2003 due primarily to growth in revenue at santana row and the acquisition of westgate mall in 2003 we incurred a full year of operating expenses but rental revenues continued to grow as occupancy increased at this project the west’s property operating income margin increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due increased revenues at santana row and decreased operating expenses resulting from leasing marketing and other startup activities related to the opening of santana row the success of santana row and houston street in san antonio texas will depend on many factors which are not entirely within our control we monitor current and longterm economic forecasts for these markets in order to evaluate the longterm financial returns of these projects the overall return on investment in the west segment significantly lags the east due to a generally lower basis in our east properties related to their earlier acquisition and to the phasing into service of santana row and houston street we expect that the returns on investment in the west will continue to rise as these projects come into service but not necessarily to the same level of overall returns as generated in the other segments 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

due to the nature of our business and strategy we generally generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to our shareholders in the form of dividends our status as a reit requires that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year as defined in 

  

the internal revenue code therefore cash needed to execute our strategy and invest in new properties as well as to pay our debt at maturity must come from one or more of the following sources 

  

   

   

   

it is management’s intention that we continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business as a result we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixedcharge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings we may from time to time seek to obtain funds by the following means 

  

   

   

   

cash and cash equivalents were 305 million and 350 million at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively 

  

summary of cash flows 

  

   

the cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the operation of our properties and the change in working capital related to our operations 

  

we used cash of 1543 million during the twelve months ended december 31 2004 in investing activities including the following

offbalance sheet arrangements  other than the joint venture described in the next paragraph and items disclosed in the contractual commitments table below we have no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2004 that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition changes in our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  

in july 2004 we entered into a joint venture arrangement by forming a limited partnership with affiliates of clarion lion properties fund “clarion” a discretionary fund created and advised by ing clarion partners we own 30 of the equity in the partnership and clarion owns 70 the partnership plans to acquire up to 350 million of stabilized supermarketanchored shopping centers in the trust’s east and west regions federal realty and clarion have committed to contribute to the partnership up to 42 million and 98 million respectively of equity capital to acquire properties through june 2006 initially clarion contributed 53 million in cash to the partnership and we contributed plaza del mercado a shopping center in montgomery county maryland which we acquired in 2003 at a contribution value of approximately 206 million concurrently with the contribution of plaza del mercado the partnership obtained a 133 million 10year loan secured by the property and we received proceeds of 186 million we are the manager of the partnership and its properties earning fees for acquisitions management leasing and financing we also have the opportunity to receive performancebased earnings through our partnership interest in 2004 the venture acquired three shopping centers in the east for 552 million we account for our interest in the partnership using the equity method in total at december 31 2004 the partnership had 472 million of mortgage notes outstanding 

  

contractual commitments

half to all of its 2947 interest in congressional plaza at the interest’s thencurrent fair market value based on management’s current estimate of fair market value as of december 31 2004 our estimated maximum liability upon exercise of the put option would range from approximately 34 million to 38 million 

  

b under the terms of two other partnerships which own properties in southern california with a cost of approximately 29 million if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships the other partners may require us to purchase their partnership interests at a formula price based upon property operating income the purchase price for one of the partnerships will be paid in cash and the purchase price for the other partnership will be paid using a limited number of our common shares or subject to certain conditions cash in those partnerships if the other partners do not redeem their interests we may choose to purchase the limited partnership interests upon the same terms 

  

c street retail san antonio lp a whollyowned subsidiary of the trust entered into a development agreement the “agreement” in 2000 with the city of san antonio texas the “city” related to the redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along houston street under the agreement we are required to issue an annual letter of credit commencing on october 1 2002 and ending on september 30 2014 that covers our designated portion of the debt service should the incremental tax revenue generated in the area specified in the agreement or the zone not cover the debt service we posted a letter of credit with the city on september 25 2002 for 795000 and the letter of credit remains outstanding our obligation under the agreement is estimated to range from 16 million to 30 million during the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 we funded approximately 434000 and 360000 respectively in anticipation of a shortfall of incremental tax revenues to the city we have accrued 700000 as of december 31 2004 to cover additional payments we may be obligated to make as part of the project costs prior to the expiration of the agreement on september 30 2014 we could be required to provide funding beyond the 700000 currently accrued we do not anticipate however that our obligation would exceed 600000 in any year or 3 million in total if the zone creates sufficient tax increment funding to repay the city’s debt prior to the expiration of the agreement we will be eligible to receive reimbursement of amounts paid for debt service shortfalls together with interest thereon 

  

d under the terms of various other partnerships which own shopping center properties with a cost of approximately 885 million including one of the two shopping centers purchased in the first quarter of 2003 the partners have the right to exchange their operating units for cash or the same number of our common shares at our option in 2004 we paid 399000 to redeem 9767 of these operating units and issued 203130 of our common shares to redeem the same amount of operating units 

  

on september 27 2004 we issued 190000 of our common shares valued at 86 million to a subsidiary the shares have been pledged to secure a note in the amount of 86 million which was issued in connection with the redemption by that subsidiary of certain of its outstanding limited partnership interests the shares were issued in a private offering in reliance upon an exemption from the registration requirements of the federal securities laws pursuant to section 42 of the securities act of 1933 on february 1 2004 the shares were sold the proceeds from the sale were used to repay the 86 million note in full

e a master lease for mercer mall includes a fixed purchase option for 55 million in 2023 if we fail to exercise our purchase option the owner of mercer mall has a put option which would require us to purchase mercer mall for 60 million in 2025 

  

f in addition to our contractual obligations we have other shortterm liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt recurring corporate expenditures including compensation agreements nonrecurring corporate expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders in addition future rental commitments are not reflected as commitments until the underlying leased space has been delivered for use overall capital requirements will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of future phases of santana row 

  

debt financing arrangements 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had total debt outstanding of 13 billion 

  

the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2004 

  

      

         

our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future these covenants require us to comply with a number of financial provisions using calculations of ratios and other amounts that are not normally useful to a financial statement reader and that are calculated in a manner that is not in accordance with gaap accordingly the numeric information set forth below is calculated as required by our various loan agreements rather than in accordance with gaap we have not included a reconciliation of this information to gaap information because in this case there is no directly comparable gaap measure similarly titled gaap measures are not relevant in determining whether or not we are in compliance with our financial covenants and we believe that the ratios on our material covenants are relevant to the reader these covenants require us to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

we are also obligated to comply with other covenants including among others provisions 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

as of december 31 2004 we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the listed covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt 

  

arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares 

  

below are the aggregate principal payments required as of december 31 2004 under our debt financing arrangements by year scheduled principal installments and amounts due at maturity are included 

  

     

our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur 

  

interest rate hedging 

  

we enter into derivative contracts which qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” in order to manage interest rate risk derivatives are not purchased for speculation we use derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to manage our fixed to variable rate debt ratio as of september 30 2004 the company had three cash flow hedge agreements which are accounted for in conformity with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by sfas no 138 “accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities—an amendment of fasb statement no 133” 

  

in january 2004 to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our 150 million fiveyear term loan issued in october 2003 we entered into an interest rate swap which fixed the libor portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2401 through october 2006 the interest rate on the term loan as of december 31 2003 was 21 based on libor plus 95 basis points upon entering into the swap the interest rate was fixed assuming no change to our debt rating at 3351 on notional amounts totaling 150 million through october 2006 on the january 2004 hedge we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the interest rate protection agreement should interest rates exceed the cap however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty the counterparty has a longterm debt rating of “a” by standard and poor’s ratings service and “a1” by moody’s investors service as of december 31 2004 although our swap is not exchange traded there are a number of financial institutions which enter into these types of transactions as part of their daytoday activities the swap has been documented as a cash flow hedge and designated as effective at inception of the swap contract consequently the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swap at its fair value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity and either a derivative instrument asset or liability is recorded on the balance sheet 

  

the two remaining hedging instruments involved an interest rate swap associated with our 699 medium term notes and an interest rate lock purchased in 2002 in connection with our 6125 notes and are described in more detail in item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk – interest rate hedging” 

  

liquidity requirements 

  

our shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under our capital and operating leases normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring trust expenditures nonrecurring trust expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders overall capital requirements in 2004 and 2005 will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of future phases of santana row to the extent that we require additional funds to meet our capital requirements and normal recurring operating costs we expect to fund these amounts from one or more of the following sources 

  

   

   

   

   

our longterm capital requirements consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisition opportunities we expect to fund these through a combination of sources which we believe will be available to us including additional and replacement secured and unsecured borrowings issuance of additional equity joint venture relationships relating to existing properties or new acquisitions and property dispositions 

  

the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 

  

   

   

   

reit qualification 

  

we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute 90 of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 

  

funds from operations 

  

funds ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance nareit defines ffo as follows net income computed in accordance with the us gaap plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and excluding extraordinary items and gains on the sale of real estate we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition and we have historically reported our ffo available for common shareholders in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities it should be noted that ffo 

  

   

   

   

we consider ffo available for common shareholders a meaningful additional measure of operating performance primarily because it excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as implied by the historical cost convention of gaap and the recording of depreciation we use ffo primarily as one of several means of assessing our operating performance in comparison with other reits comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 

  

an increase or decrease in ffo available for common shareholders does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 

  

the reconciliation of net income to funds from operations available for common shareholders is as follows 

  

   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about mark et risk 

  

our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subjects us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements we also enter into certain types of derivative financial instruments to further reduce interest rate risk we use interest rate protection and swap agreements for example to convert some of our variable rate debt to a fixedrate basis or to hedge anticipated financing transactions we use derivatives for hedging purposes rather than speculation and do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 

  

interest rate risk 

  

the following discusses the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates of interest on interest expense for variable rate debt and on the fair value of total outstanding debt including our fixedrate debt interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt this analysis does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect our debt such as the effect that a changing interest rate environment could have on the overall level of economic activity or the action that our management likely would take to reduce our exposure to the change this analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 

  

fixed interest rate debt  the majority of our outstanding debt obligations maturing at various times through 2028 or through 2077 including capital lease obligations have fixed interest rates which limit the risk of 

  

fluctuating interest rates interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments however at december 31 2004 we had 11 billion of fixedrate debt outstanding if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2004 had been 10 higher the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased by approximately 114 million if interest rates on our fixedrate debt instruments at december 31 2004 had been 10 lower the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have increased by approximately 114 million 

  

variable interest rate debt  we believe that our primary interest rate risk is due to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2004 we had 1644 million of variable rate debt outstanding based upon this balance of variable rate debt if interest rates increased 10 our interest expense would increase by approximately 16 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 16 million if interest rates decreased 10 our interest expense would decrease by approximately 16 million and our net income and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately 16 million 

  

interest rate hedging 

  

our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks we use derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to manage our fixed to variable rate debt ratio 

  

cash flow hedging  to accomplish this objective the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the payment of fixed rate amounts in exchange for variable rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount during the year ended december 31 2004 these derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt as of december 31 2004 the company had entered into three cash flow hedge agreements which are accounted for in conformity with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by sfas no 138 “accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities—an amendment of fasb statement no 133” 

  

a more detailed description of these derivative financial instruments is contained in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources—interest rate hedging” 

  

hedging of unsecured notes  we have entered into several interest rate swaps or interest rate locks that hedged certain unsecured notes in january 2004 to hedge our exposure to interest rates on the 150 million fiveyear term loan we entered into an interest rate swap which fixed the libor portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2401 through october 2006 the interest rate on the term loan as of december 31 2003 was 21 based on libor plus 95 basis points the current interest rate taking into account the swap is 3351 2401 plus 095 on notional amounts totaling 150 million 

  

in anticipation of a 150 million senior unsecured note offering on august 1 2002 we entered into a treasury lock that fixed the benchmark five year treasury rate at 3472 through august 19 2002 the rate lock was documented as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction and designated as effective at the inception of the contract on august 16 2002 we priced the senior unsecured notes with a scheduled closing date of august 21 2002 and closed out the associated rate lock fiveyear treasury rates declined between the pricing period and the settlement of the hedge purchase therefore to settle the rate lock we paid 15 million as a result of the august 19 2002 fire at santana row we were not able to proceed with the note offering at that time however we consummated a 150 million senior unsecured note offering on november 15 2002 and thus the hedge loss is being amortized into interest expense over the life of the related notes 

  

we also purchased an interest rate swap with a face amount of 405 million upon issuance of our 699 medium term notes which reduced the effective interest rate from 699 to 6894

quarterly assessment we carried out an assessment as of december 31 2004 of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting this assessment was done under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer rules adopted by the sec require that we present the conclusions of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and the conclusions of our management about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this annual report 

  

principal executive officer and principal financial officer certifications included as exhibits 311 and 312 to this annual report on form 10k are forms of “certification” of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer the forms of certification are required in accordance with section 302 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 this section of this annual report on form 10k that you currently are reading is the information concerning the assessment referred to in the section 302 certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the section 302 certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented 

  

disclosure controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports such as this report on form 10k is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our president and chief executive officer and senior vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure these controls and procedures are based closely on the definition of “disclosure controls and procedures” in rule 13a15e promulgated under the exchange act rules adopted by the sec require that we present the conclusions of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report 

  

internal control over financial reporting establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of our president and chief executive officer and senior vice president and chief financial officer as appropriate and effected by our employees including management and our board of trustees to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles this process includes policies and procedures that 

  

   

   

   

limitations on the effectiveness of controls management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial 

  

reporting will prevent all errors and fraud in designing and evaluating our control system management recognized that any control system no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any that may affect our operation have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management’s override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions that cannot be anticipated at the present time or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 

  

scope of the evaluations the evaluation by our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting included a review of procedures and our internal audit as well as discussions with our disclosure committee independent public accountants and others in our organization as appropriate in conducting this evaluation our management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework in the course of the evaluation we sought to identify data errors control problems or acts of fraud and to confirm that appropriate corrective action including process improvements were being undertaken the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is done on a quarterly basis so that the conclusions concerning the effectiveness of such controls can be reported in our quarterly reports on form 10q and annual reports on form 10k 

  

our internal control over financial reporting is also assessed on an ongoing basis by personnel in our accounting department and by our independent auditors in connection with their audit and review activities the overall goals of these various evaluation activities are to monitor our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and to make modifications as necessary our intent in this regard is that the disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be maintained and updated including with improvements and corrections as conditions warrant among other matters we sought in our evaluation to determine whether there were any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” in our internal control over financial reporting or whether we had identified any acts of fraud involving personnel who have a significant role in our internal control over financial reporting this information is important both for the evaluation generally and because the section 302 certifications require that our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer disclose that information to the audit committee of our board of trustees and our independent auditors and also require us to report on related matters in this section of the annual report on form 10k in the public company accounting oversight board’s auditing standard no 2 a “significant deficiency” is a “control deficiency” or a combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with gaap such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected a “control deficiency” exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis a “material weakness” is defined in auditing standard no 2 as a significant deficiency or a combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected we also sought to deal with other control matters in the evaluation and in any case in which a problem was identified we considered what revision improvement andor correction was necessary to be made in accordance with our ongoing procedures 

  

periodic evaluation and conclusion of disclosure controls and procedures  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report based on that evaluation the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report

february 28 2002 our board of trustees approved the adoption of a business plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of owning managing redeveloping and acquiring community and neighborhood shopping centers anchored by grocery stores drug stores or high volume value oriented retailers that provide consumer necessities we will complete our mixeduse projects in san jose california and bethesda maryland but will not pursue any new largescale groundup development projects operating strategies our core operating strategy is to actively manage our properties to maximize rents and maintain high occupancy levels by attracting and retaining a strong and diverse base of tenants our properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and affluent areas of the country in addition because of the infill nature of our locations our centers generally face less competition per capita than centers owned by our peers these strong demographics help our tenants generate higher sales which has enabled us to maintain high occupancy rates high rental rates and consistent rental rate growth all of which has lead to increased value of our portfolio our operating strategies also include  investing strategies our investment strategy calls for deploying capital at riskadjusted rates of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that have potential for goingforward net income growth equal to or in excess of that of our core portfolio of properties our investments primarily fall into one of the following four categories    5 

   investment criteria when we evaluate potential redevelopment retenanting expansion and acquisition opportunities we consider such factors as  financing strategies our financing strategies are designed to maintain a strong balance sheet while maintaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing activities in the most cost efficient way possible our financing strategies include   6 

  employees at december 31 2003 we had 283 fulltime employees and 153 parttime employees none of the employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit we believe that our relationship with our employees is good tax status we elected under section 856c of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended which we refer to as the code to be taxed as a reit under the code beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 1962 as a reit we are generally not subject to federal income tax on reit taxable income that we distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income each year we will be subject to federal income tax on our reit taxable income including any applicable alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a reit for tax purposes in any taxable year or to the extent we distribute less than 100 of reit taxable income we will also not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed reit taxable income in addition certain of our subsidiaries are subject to federal state and local income taxes governmental regulations affecting our properties we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local environmental health safety and similar laws including  7 

 the application of these laws to a specific property that we own will be dependent on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the former uses of the property the building materials used at each property and the physical layout of each property under certain environmental laws principally cercla we as the owner or operator of our current properties or properties we previously owned may be required to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property we may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination whether or not we knew of or were responsible for the contamination in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination as the owner or operator of real estate we also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the real estate such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral our compliance with existing environmental health safety and similar laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the impact of new or changed laws or regulations on our current properties or on properties that we may acquire in the future we have no current plans for substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental health safety and similar laws and we carry environmental insurance which covers a number of environmental risks for most of our properties competition numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us for tenants and properties to acquire some of these competitors may possess greater capital resources than we do although no single competitor or group of competitors in any of the markets where our properties are located is believed to be dominant in that market this competition may  retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods and services such as direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants 8

 item 2 properties general as of december 31 2003 we owned or had an interest in 62 community and neighborhood shopping centers comprising approximately 135 million square feet primarily located in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the northeast and midatlantic united states in addition we owned 49 urban and retail mixeduse properties comprising over 27 million square feet and one apartment complex primarily located in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions and california no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2003 total revenue or net income we believe that our properties are adequately covered by commercial general liability fire flood earthquake terrorism and business interruption insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits we operate our business on an asset management model where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we have divided our portfolio of properties into three operating regions the northeast midatlantic and west each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager with dedicated leasing property management and financial staff and operates largely autonomously with respect to day to day operating decisions tenant diversification as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 2200 tenants ranging from sole proprietors to major national retailers no one tenant or affiliated group of tenants accounted for more than 23 of our annualized base rent as of december 31 2003 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our exposure to recent and future bankruptcy filings in the retail sector has not been and will not be significant 9 

geographic diversification our 111 properties are located in 14 states and the district of columbia the following table shows by region and state within the region the number of properties the gross leasable area in square feet and the percentage of total portfolio gross leasable area in each state as of december 31 2003  

leases lease terms and lease expirations our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured to include the monthly payment in advance of minimum rents with periodic increases percentage rents based on our tenants’ gross sales volumes and reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes these features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs caused by inflation and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales leases on apartments are generally for a period of one year or less and in 2003 represented approximately 26 of total revenues commercial property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases with anchor tenants may be longer many of the leases contain provisions allowing the tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration at rates which often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our commercial leases in place as of december 31 2003 for each of the 10 years beginning with 2004 assuming that none of the tenants exercise their future renewal options annualized base rents reflect inplace contractual rents as of december 31 2003

on march 9 2004 there were 5183 holders of record of our common shares our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at least 100 of our reit taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous organizational and operational 19 

requirements including the requirement to distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income state income taxes are not material to our operations or cash flows future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our annual dividend rate for 36 consecutive years our total annual dividends paid per share for 2003 and 2002 were 1945 per share and 1925 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are different from total distributions calculated for tax purposes distributions to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholder’s basis in such shareholder’s shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholder’s basis in its shares will have the effect of deferring taxation until the sale of the shareholder’s shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if any of distributions in 2004 or subsequent years will constitute a return of capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under code sec 857b3 to designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the shareholder as longterm capital gains during 2003 a portion of the distributions was designated as a capital gain dividend following is the income tax status of distributions paid during the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 to common shareholders  

distributions on our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares are payable at the rate of 2125 per share per annum prior to distributions on our common shares our 795 series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares paid distributions at a rate of 19875 per share per annum and were redeemed in full in june 2003 we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements will have an adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends in the normal course of business to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit 20 




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in item 1 of this report this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 also documents that we “incorporate by reference” into this annual report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the securities and exchange commission which we refer to as the sec will contain forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or information sometimes we use words such as “may” “will” “could” “should” “plans” “intends” “expects” “believes” “estimates” “anticipates” and “continues” in particular the risk factors included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k describe forwardlooking information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those we describe these factors include but are not limited to  given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements or those incorporated into this annual report on form 10k we also make no promise to update any of the forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the risks and the risk factors incorporated herein by reference from our form 8k filed on march 11 2004 before making any investment in us overview we are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership management development and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixeduse properties as of december 31 2003 we owned or had an interest in 62 community and neighborhood shopping centers comprising approximately 135 million square feet primarily located in densely 23 

populated and affluent communities throughout the northeast and midatlantic united states in addition we owned 49 urban and retail mixeduse properties comprising over 27 million square feet and one apartment complex primarily located in strategic metropolitan markets in the northeast and midatlantic regions and california in total our properties were 931 leased at december 31 2003 and 947 leased at december 31 2002 critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which we refer to as gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates are prepared using management’s best judgment after considering past and current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information external market information when available and when necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts actual results could differ from these estimates management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition the most significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates are as follows revenue recognition and accounts receivable leases with tenants are classified as operating leases base rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related leases net of valuation adjustments based on management’s assessment of credit collection and other business risk we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to base rents including receivables from recording rent on a straightline basis expense reimbursements and other revenue or income taking into account payment history industry trends and the period of recovery in doing so we generally reserve for straightline rents due to be collected beyond ten years because of uncertainty of collection in some cases the ultimate collectibility of these claims extends beyond one year these estimates have a direct impact on our net income historically we have recognized bad debt expense between 10 and 15 of rental income if we were to have experienced an increase in bad debt of 05 of rental income in 2003 our net income would have been reduced by approximately 16 million real estate the nature of our business as an owner redeveloper and operator of retail shopping centers means that we are very capital intensive depreciation and maintenance of our shopping centers and mixeduse properties constitutes a substantial cost for the trust as well as the industry as a whole the trust capitalizes real estate investments and depreciates it in accordance with gaap and consistent with industry standards based on our best estimates of the assets’ physical and economic useful lives the cost of our real estate investments 24 

less salvage value if any is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the asset using straightline rates for financial statement purposes we periodically review the lives of our assets and implement changes as necessary to the depreciation rates these reviews take into account the historical retirement and replacement of our assets the repairs required to maintain the condition of our assets the cost of redevelopments which may extend the useful lives of our assets and general economic and real estate factors a newly developed neighborhood shopping center building would typically have an economic useful life of 50 to 60 years but since many of our assets are not newly developed buildings estimating the useful lives of assets that are longlived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgment accordingly we believe that the estimates we make to determine our depreciation expense for accounting purposes are critical land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost depreciation is computed using the straightline method with useful lives ranging generally from 35 years to a maximum of 50 years on buildings and improvements maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements whichever is shorter minor improvements furniture and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over useful lives ranging from three to 15 years certain external and internal costs directly related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the capitalized costs associated with developments redevelopments and leasing are depreciated or amortized over the life of the improvement and lease respectively unamortized leasing costs are charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of sfas no 13 these estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis these assessments have a direct impact on net income certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation unforeseen competition or changes in customer shopping habits could substantially alter our assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on investment in the property and therefore reduce the economic life of the asset and affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge against both the current and future revenues we will continue to periodically review the lives of assets and any decrease in asset lives could have the effect of increasing depreciation expense while any analysis indicating that lives are longer than we have assumed could have the effect of decreasing depreciation expense in order to determine the impact on depreciation expense of a different average life of our real estate assets taken as a whole we used 25 years which is the approximate average life of all assets being depreciated at the end of 2003 if the estimated useful lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year the consolidated depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately 30 million if the estimated useful lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year the consolidated depreciation expense would have increased by approximately 30 million 25 

interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period for capitalizing interest is extended more interest is capitalized thereby decreasing interest expense and increasing net income during that period longlived assets there are estimates and assumptions made by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which the actual results will emerge over long periods of time this includes the recoverability of longlived assets including our properties which have been acquired or developed management must evaluate properties for possible impairment of value and for those properties where impairment may be indicated make estimates of future cash flows including revenues operating expenses required maintenance and development expenditures market conditions demand for space by tenants and rental rates over very long periods because our properties typically have a very long life the assumptions used to estimate the future recoverability of book value requires significant management judgment in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” effective for us on january 1 2002 sfas no 144 requires that one accounting model be used for longlived assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newlyacquired and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity as a result the sale of a property or the classification of a property as held for sale requires us to report the results of that property as “discontinued operations” we are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining whether there is an impairment of an asset actual results could be significantly different from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income contingencies we are sometimes involved in lawsuits and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the amount and likelihood of loss relating to these matters these estimates and assumptions have a direct impact on net income 26

2003 financing developments on february 11 2003 the 244 million woodmont east construction loan and the 170 million friendship center mortgage were paid off through borrowings under our revolving credit facility on may 14 2003 we issued 32 million common shares at 30457 per share 3148 gross before an aggregate 325 underwriters discount and selling concession netting 984 million in cash proceeds on june 13 2003 we redeemed our 100 million 795 series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares using the proceeds from the may 14 2003 common stock offering and additional borrowings under our line of credit on june 23 2003 we redeemed and paid in full our 75 million 5 ¼ convertible subordinated debentures originally due to mature on october 28 2003 through borrowings under our revolving credit facility on october 8 2003 we closed on a new 550 million unsecured credit facility which replaced our 300 million revolving credit facility and 125 million term loan both of which were due to mature on december 19 2003 the new credit facility consists of a 150 million fiveyear term loan a 100 million threeyear term loan and a 300 million threeyear revolving credit facility with a oneyear extension option the term loans bear interest at libor plus 95 basis points while the revolving facility bears interest at libor plus 75 basis points the spread over libor is subject to adjustment based on our credit rating covenants under the new credit facility are substantially the same type as were required under the previous facility concurrent with the replacement of our 125 million term loan with the new credit facility we unwound the related interest rate swaps which were due to expire on december 19 2003 at of cost of approximately 11 million in january 2004 to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our 150 million term loan issued in october 2003 we entered into an interest rate swap which fixed the libor portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2401 through october 2006 the interest rate on the term loan as of december 31 2003 was libor plus 95 basis points subsequent to entering into the swap the interest rate was fixed at 3351 2401 plus 095 on notional amounts totaling 150 million a 59 million loan receivable which currently bears interest at 788 and is secured by an office building in san francisco california was due february 28 2003 but was not repaid on the due date we are currently negotiating with the borrower to extend the loan until march 31 2005 when the loan modification is complete the interest rate on the note will decrease to 6 retroactive to july 1 2003 interest on the loan is current through december 31 2003 and based in part on the value of the underlying collateral we believe that the loan is collectible and as such no reserve has been established at this time santana row in 2003 our single largest development capital need was the completion of phase i and phase ii of santana row a multiphase mixeduse project built on 42 acres in san jose california in the heart of silicon valley the project consists of residential retail and hotel components creating a community with the feel of an urban district phase i of the project includes eight buildings which contain approximately 444000 square feet of retail space 255 residential units a 213 room hotel and the supporting infrastructure the first building containing 40000 square feet and leased to crate  barrel opened on june 27 2002 six of the remaining seven buildings consisting of approximately 317000 square feet of retail space opened on november 7 2002 the remaining building “building seven” contained approximately 87000 square feet of retail space approximately 1000 parking spaces and 246 residential units until a fire on august 19 2002 prior to its scheduled opening the fire in august 2002 destroyed all but 11 of the 246 residential units and damaged the retail units and a parking structure resulting in a delay of the 29 

opening of the retail units from september 2002 until february 2003 we estimate the total cost of phase i to be approximately 443 million net of related insurance proceeds in december 2003 we reached final settlement with our insurance company regarding the santana row fire claim and received a final payment of 269 million bringing the total settlement to 1290 million in total all of the proceeds except approximately 11 million has been accounted for as a reduction in the cost basis of the property or reimbursement of costs to cleanup and restore damaged property or reimbursements to third parties the remaining 11 million has been accounted for as a reimbursement of lost rents of which 8 million was recognized in 2003 as part of rental income and the remainder will be recognized as rental income in 2004 a gain of 200000 was recognized in the second quarter of 2003 to account for that portion of the insurance proceeds received in excess of costs of the constructed assets on february 7 2003 we announced plans for phase ii of santana row which includes approximately 84000 square feet of retail space on two pad sites and 275 additional parking spaces the phase ii retail space was opened and operating prior to yearend 2003 with total development costs of approximately 26 million the two primary tenants of phase ii the container store and best buy opened in the fourth quarter of 2003 in november 2003 we announced the planned development of 96 townhomes and 160 flats on the building 7 podium to replace the units that were destroyed in the august 2002 fire construction began in late 2003 and the first units are expected to be available in early 2005 with the balance delivered later in that year the trust will invest nearly 60 million of incremental capital to complete the residential development the success of santana row will depend on many factors which cannot be assured and are not entirely within our control these factors include among others the demand for retail and residential space the cost of operations including utilities and insurance the availability and cost of capital and the general economy particularly in and around silicon valley 

results of operations same center throughout this section we have provided certain information on a “same center” basis information provided on a same center basis is provided for only those properties that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared and includes properties which were redeveloped or expanded during the periods being compared properties purchased or sold and properties under development at any time during the periods being compared are excluded for purposes of the following discussion of our results of operations on a same center basis for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 we exclude the four shopping centers acquired during 2003 and 2002 mount vernon plaza south valley shopping center plaza del mercado and mercer mall as well as the dispositions two buildings in bethesda maryland an undeveloped parcel in washington county oregon one building in evanston illinois one building in greenwich connecticut one property in brookline massachusetts and four buildings in west hartford connecticut we also exclude the six properties sold in 2002 one property in greenwich connecticut two properties in westport 30 

connecticut one property in westfield new jersey one property in hollywood california and one property in portland oregon and properties under development in 2003 or 2002 including two of our street retail properties santana row in san jose california and pentagon row in arlington virginia same center information for the year ended december 31 2002 excludes the six properties sold in 2002 the williamsburg shopping center in williamsburg virginia 101 e oak street in chicago illinois and 7010 austin street in forest hills new york which were sold in 2001 friendship center in washington dc which was purchased on september 21 2001 the office building located at 580 market street in san francisco california which was exchanged for the minority partner’s interest in santana row and properties under development in 2001 and 2002 including pentagon row in arlington virginia and santana row in san jose california year ended december 31 2003 to year ended december 31 2002  

revenues total revenues in 2003 were 3579 million which represents an increase of 422 million or 134 over total revenues of 3156 million in 2002 the primary drivers of this growth are acquisitions an increase in same center revenues from higher rent on tenant rollovers as detailed below and income of approximately 80 million resulting from the portion of the settlement of our insurance claims for the august 2002 fire at santana row that related to lost rent in addition we experienced increased cost recoveries related to higher operating costs the percentage leased at our shopping centers declined to 931 at december 31 2003 compared to 947 at year end 2002 due to acquisitions of centers with lower occupancy rates and the bankruptcies of several principal tenants including kmart and today’s man as well as an 31 

increase in redevelopment activity which results in leaseable space being taken out of service for more extended periods   rental income rental income consists primarily of minimum rent percentage rent and cost recoveries from tenants of common area maintenance and real estate taxes rental income increased 397 million or 135  in 2003 versus 2002 due largely to the following    other property income other property income increased 23 million or 151 to 178 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to 155 million for the year ended december 31 2002 included in other property income are items which although recurring tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period such as utility reimbursements lease termination fees and temporary tenant income the increase in other property income in 2003 is primarily the result of higher utility reimbursements at santana row as the property has come on line and higher temporary tenant income partly offset by lower lease termination fees   interest and other income interest and other income consisted primarily of interest earned on mortgage notes receivable and overnight cash investments in 2002 there was also income on taxdeferred exchange escrow deposits as well as a provision for estimated losses related to various unconsolidated restaurant joint ventures at santana row interest and other income remained relatively flat from 2002 to 2003 as the reduced losses related to the restaurant joint ventures were offset by reduced interest income on the taxdeferred exchange escrow accounts and other interest income expenses total property operating expenses were 1180 million or an increase of 144 million when compared to 1037 million in 2002 the total increase in expenses is due almost entirely to higher real estate taxes increased maintenance costs related to snow removal in 2003 and the impact of acquisitions and developments as detailed below   rental expense rental expense increased 105 million or 143 to 834 million in 2003 from 730 million in 2002 of this increase  property expense reductions related to disposed properties were not significant as a result of these changes in rental expenses rental income and other property income rental expense as a percentage of rental income plus other property income increased slightly 32 

from 235 in 2002 to 237 in 2003 we refer to rental income plus other property income as “property income”   real estate taxes real estate tax expense rose 127 in 2003 to 346 million compared to 307 million in 2002 the increase in 2003 is due largely to higher tax assessments for our properties in the east coast segment as well as increased assessments of 18 million related to acquired and developed properties including santana row which was brought into service starting in late 2002   property operating income property operating income was 2398 million for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 279 million compared to 2120 million in 2002 of this amount approximately 80 million relates to the santana row fire insurance proceeds attributable to rental income lost as a result of the fire excluding these proceeds property operating income rose 199 million during 2003 due primarily to  same center property operating income rose 27 or almost 57 million in 2003 due to increased rental income associated with tenant rollovers and higher real estate tax recoveries and reduced property administrative expenses partly offset by property expenses which rose higher than the related recoveries particularly the snow removal costs   interest expense  interest expense rose 102 million or 156 to 752 million in 2003 this substantial rise is almost entirely due to lower capitalization of interest and therefore higher interest expense as most of our property under development particularly at santana row was placed into service gross interest expense in 2003 was 887 million versus 886 million in 2002 capitalized interest amounted to 135 million and 235 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively   administrative expense administrative expenses decreased by 20 million during 2003 or 143 to 118 million compared to 138 million in 2002 this 20 million decrease resulted primarily from payroll and related benefits savings resulting from the management restructuring which began in february 2002 in addition we experienced savings in legal costs and costs to support and maintain our information systems these savings were largely offset by increased expensing of costs which had previously had been capitalized related to personnel involved in the development of santana row in 2004 we expect administrative expenses to rise to those levels seen in 2002 due to higher costs of personnel and related expenditures   restructuring expense the restructuring expenses incurred in 2002 related to our adoption of a new business and management succession plan resulting in a charge of 85 million all of which was expended in 2002 in december 2002 we recorded a charge of 138 million as a result of an accelerated executive transition plan of which 127 million was expended in 2003 03 million was reversed and 08 million remains to be expended as of december 31 2003   depreciation and amortization expense expenses attributable to depreciation and amortization rose 113 million to 751 million in 2003 from 638 million in 2002 an increase of 177 the increase is due to depreciation on properties which were acquired in 2003 as well as depreciation of santana row which started opening in late 2002 and pentagon row which came fully into service during 2002 33 

other   minority interests  the increase in minority interests of 06 million in income to minority interest from 41 million in 2002 to 47 million in 2003 is the result of increased earnings as well as an increase in the number of operating partnership units held by minority investors units which were issued in connection with our acquisition of mount vernon shopping center were partially offset by a decrease in units outstanding as a results of redemptions during the year   operating income from discontinued operations operating income from discontinued operations represents the operating income of properties that have been disposed of which under sfas no 144 are required to be reported separately from results of ongoing operations the reported operating income of 14 million and 29 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively represent the operating income for the period during which we owned the ten properties sold in 2003 and the six properties sold in 2002   gain on sale of real estate net of loss on abandoned developments held for sale the gain on sale of real estate in 2003 was 201 million for the disposal of properties as outlined above none of the properties sold in 2003 resulted in a loss the gain in 2002 of 95 million is the result of the sale of six properties partly offset by the recognition of a 97 million impairment loss associated with our change in business plan in that year comparison of year ended december 31 2002 to year ended december 31 2001  

revenues total revenues increased 261 million or 90 to 3156 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 2896 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the primary components of the increase in total revenues are discussed below   rental income rental income consists of minimum rent percentage rent and cost recoveries for common area maintenance and real estate taxes the increase in rental income of 257 million or 96 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to    other property income other property income includes items which although recurring tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period such as utility reimbursements lease termination fees and temporary tenant income the increase in other property income of 18 million or 128 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to    interest and other income interest and other income includes interest earned on mortgage notes receivable overnight cash investments including taxdeferred exchange escrow deposits as well as a provision for estimated losses related to various unconsolidated restaurant joint ventures at santana row the decrease in interest and other income of 14 million or 218 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to a write down associated with the estimated impairment of 13 million in these joint ventures which represented our best estimate of the diminution of value based upon the then current economic climate surrounding these joint ventures 35 

expenses total property operating expenses increased 144 million to 1037 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 893 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the primary components of the increase in total expenses are discussed below   rental expense  the increase in rental expense of 114 million or 185 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to  rental expense as a percentage of rental income and other property income which we refer to as property income increased slightly from 218 in 2001 to 235 in 2002 due primarily to increased marketing and preopening expenses at santana row same center rental expense excluding the effect of property redevelopments and expansions as a percentage of property income decreased slightly from 200 in 2001 to 196 in 2002 and overall for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 22 from 2001   real estate taxes  the increase in real estate taxes of 30 million or 110 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to the impact of taxes at santana row which started coming into service in 2002 the impact of other acquired and developed properties and a general increase in tax assessments on a same center basis real estate taxes increased 70 due primarily to increased taxes on recently redeveloped properties and overall increases in tax assessments at various projects principally woodmont east fresh meadows garden market and midpike same center real estate taxes excluding the effect of property redevelopments and expansions for the year ended december 31 2002 increased 61 from 2001   property operating income  as a result of the changes and variances explained above property operating income total income less rental expenses and real estate taxes increased 116 million or 58 to 2120 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 2003 million for the year ended december 31 2001   interest expense  in 2002 we incurred interest of 886 million of which 235 million was capitalized yielding interest expense of 651 million as compared to interest incurred of 871 million in 2001 of which 178 million was capitalized yielding interest expense of 693 million the decrease in interest expense of 42 million or 61 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to 36 

     administrative expense the decrease in administrative expense of 05 million or 34 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is mostly attributable to lower payroll costs in 2002 as a result of our corporate restructuring as a result administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 48 in the year ended december 31 2001 to 43 in the year ended december 31 2002   restructuring charge  on february 28 2002 we adopted a new business plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of acquiring and redeveloping community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by supermarkets drug stores or high volume value oriented retailers that provide consumer necessities concurrent with the adoption of the business plan we adopted a management succession plan and restructured our management team in connection with these plans we recorded a charge of 182 million this charge included a reserve for a restructuring charge of 85 million made up of 69 million of severance and other compensation costs for several of our senior officers related to the management restructuring as well as the writeoff of 16 million of our development costs all charges against this february 2002 reserve totaling 85 million were expended during 2002 in addition in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a charge of 138 million as a result of the accelerated executive transition whereby donald c wood the trust’s president and chief operating officer replaced steven guttman as chief executive officer of the trust the fourth quarter charge includes an accrual of 79 million at december 31 2002 for payments and benefits due to mr guttman pursuant to his contractual arrangements with us and for other transition related costs no cash payments were made against this charge in 2002 and the majority of the accrual was expended in 2003   depreciation and amortization expense  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of 55 million or 95 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 reflects the impact of recent new developments tenant improvements and property redevelopments which were placed into service throughout 2001 and 2002 other   minority interests the decrease in investors’ share of operations of 11 million or 205 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to our 2001 purchase of the minority interest in nine street retail buildings in southern california and three street retail buildings in forest hills new york and the operating unit holders’ share of the decrease in operating income in 2002   gain on sale of real estate net of loss on abandoned developments held for sale the approximately 300000 increase in gain on sale of real estate net of loss on abandoned developments held for sale for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to  37 

    operating income from discontinued operations  beginning in 2002 sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” requires that gains and losses from dispositions of properties and all operating earnings from these properties be reported as income from operations of discontinued assets this also requires that all past earnings applicable to a property disposed of subsequent to january 1 2002 be reported as income from operations of discontinued assets as a result the presentation of reported income will be updated each time a property is sold this requirement is for presentation only and has no impact on net income as described above in 2002 we sold six properties for a combined gain of 191 million the earnings generated from these properties have been reported as income from operations of discontinued assets in accordance with sfas no 144 income from operations of discontinued assets for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 was 29 million and 62 million respectively with the decrease being primarily due to the fact that these properties were owned for less than a full year in 2002 segment results we operate our business on an asset management model where teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we have divided our portfolio of properties into three operating regions the midatlantic northeast and west each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager with dedicated leasing property management and financial staff and operates largely autonomously with respect to day to day operating decisions incentive compensation throughout the regional teams is tied to the property operating income of the respective portfolios the following selected key segment data presented is for the full year except real estate assets and gross leasable area which is presented as of yearend the results of properties which have been disposed are excluded from property operating income presented below in accordance with sfas no 144 property operating income consists of rental income other property income and interest income less rental expense and real estate taxes this measure is used internally to evaluate the performance of our regional operations and we consider it to be a significant measurement 38 

 

midatlantic the midatlantic region extends roughly from baltimore south through metropolitan washington dc and further south through virginia and north carolina two properties in florida are also included in this region as of december 31 2003 the midatlantic included 35 properties after three acquisitions in 2003 mount vernon plaza south valley shopping center and plaza del mercado and two disposals in 2003 4929 and 4925 bethesda avenue there was no acquisition or disposal activity in 2002 in this region but 2002 saw increased results from pentagon row which was phased into service between 2001 and 2002 and from the impact of friendship center which was acquired in 2001 the williamsburg shopping center was sold in 2001 total revenue in the midatlantic grew 80 in 2003 after showing 13 growth in 2002 the revenue growth in 2003 largely reflects the increase in leasable area related to acquisitions as well as increased expense recovery the significant growth in 2002 is due primarily to the acquisition of friendship center but also to the additional income from pentagon row which opened in late 2001 and the successful retenanting at several shopping centers development fees earned in 2003 and 2002 amounted to 10 million and 08 million respectively and tend to be nonrecurring 39 

the percentage leased was 93 96 and 96 as of year end 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the decrease in 2003 occupancy reflects the impact of several anchor closings including kmart the impact of acquiring mt vernon plaza and south valley shopping center both of which had lower than average occupancy when acquired and an increase in redevelopment activity which will keep leasable space out of service until the redevelopments are complete we expect that the increased redevelopment activity will continue in 2004 and 2005 the improved rate of operating income to total revenue in the midatlantic in 2003 was caused largely by a decrease in expenses which are not recoverable from tenants particularly legal costs and lower overhead expenses the property operating margin to revenue decreased in 2002 when compared to 2001 as a rise in property taxes was not completely offset by a similar rise in cost recoveries for the year northeast the northeast region extends from suburban philadelphia north through new york and its suburbs into new england this region also includes several properties located in illinois and one located in michigan as of december 31 2003 the northeast region had 42 properties which reflects one acquisition and seven buildings disposed in 2003 and four small buildings disposed in 2002 one property was sold in 2001 in the northeast total revenue was flat in 2003 when compared to 2002 after rising 7 in 2002 when compared to 2001 northeast total revenue was flat in 2003 versus 2002 as a decrease in occupancy rates was offset by an increase in common area expense recoveries particularly related to snow removal in the first quarter of 2003 and to real estate tax recoveries the growth in 2002 over 2001 was driven primarily by an increase in rental rates at redeveloped expanded and retenanted centers as well as increased rental rates on rollovers and increased recoveries related to refinements in the recovery accrual process the percentage leased was 95 96 and 96 as of december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the slight decrease in 2003 reflects the closing of several principal tenants including kmart an increase in redevelopment activity which has taken leasable space out of service and the acquisition of mercer mall whose leased rate is currently below that of the rest of the region mercer mall had a leased rate of approximately 80 when acquired in october 2003 we expect that the increased redevelopment activity will continue in 2004 and 2005 the decrease in the rate of operating income to total revenue in 2003 when compared to 2002 was caused largely by a lower recovery rate on higher common area expenses particularly due to the snow removal costs incurred in the first quarter of 2003 in addition the region experienced lower lease termination fees in 2003 and higher costs to provide utilities at our fresh meadows property the increased operating income margin in 2002 over 2001 was due to improved cost recoveries on relatively flat rental expenses west as of december 31 2003 34 of our properties including santana row were located in the west region the west region extends from texas to the west coast in 2003 we disposed of one parcel of undeveloped land while in 2002 we disposed of one shopping center and exchanged the property at 580 market street in san francisco california for the minority partner’s interest in santana row in 2001 we sold one shopping center in the west region 40 

total revenue in the west rose 308 million or 81 in 2003 over 2002 of which 213 million relates to increased total revenues at santana row as well as the impact of the 2002 13 million writedown associated with the impairment of our restaurant joint ventures which was charged to other income in 2002 in addition approximately 80 million of the rental income growth comes from the insurance proceeds received related to the fire at santana row the insurance proceeds are reported as part of rental income as they relate largely to lost rents on the delayed opening of the residential and retail units and rental concessions to tenants excluding the santana row revenue growth and the insurance proceeds total revenue growth in 2003 was 4 as higher income in san antonio texas and southern california more than offset lower revenue at our property at 150 post street in san francisco california total revenue growth in 2002 over 2001 was due largely to increased rental rates at redeveloped and retenanted properties and santana row coming on line in 2002 which was offset by a decrease in revenue related to 580 market street which was sold in 2002 income from the insurance proceeds of approximately 30 million will be recognized in 2004 for the west region the percentage leased was 88 84 and 93 at years ending 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the santana row development added approximately 529000 square feet of retail space to the west coast since the end of 2001 the improved occupancy as of year end 2003 compared to the end of 2002 is due largely to increases at santana row and houston street in san antonio texas the west region’s property operating income margin to revenue improved in 2003 over 2002 due almost entirely to the significant growth in revenue at santana row the operating expenses associated with santana row started increasing in 2002 as a result of leasing marketing and other startup costs in preparation for and during the opening of this project in 2003 we incurred a full year of operating expenses but rental revenues continued growing during the year as occupancy increased the west’s property operating income margin dropped in 2002 compared to 2001 due to the opening of santana described above partly offset by in an increase in interest income from mortgage notes receivable we expect the margin to again increase in 2004 due to higher occupancy at santana row and our property in san antonio texas but at a slower pace than the improvement in 2003 the success of santana row and houston street in san antonio texas will depend on many factors which are not entirely within our control we monitor current and longterm economic forecasts for these markets in order to evaluate the longterm financial returns of these projects the overall return on investment in the west segment significantly lags the northeast and midatlantic due to the phasing into service of santana row and houston street we expect that the returns on investment in the west will continue to rise as these projects come into service but not necessarily to the same level of overall returns as generated in the other segments 

liquidity and capital resources due to the nature of our business and our strategy we are generally in a position to generate significant amounts of cash from operations the cash generated from operations is primarily paid to shareholders in the form of dividends one of the requirements of our maintaining our status as a reit is the requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income each year therefore cash needs for executing our strategy and investing in new 41 

properties as well as payment of debt maturities must come from cash not distributed to shareholders from proceeds of property dispositions or from the proceeds of raising new capital by issuing equity or debt securities it is management’s intention that we continually have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business as such we intend to operate with and maintain a conservative capital structure that will allow us to maintain strong debt service coverage and fixed charge coverage ratios as part of our commitment to investmentgrade debt ratings at december 31 2003 our level of debt to total market capitalization was 39 we may from time to time seek to obtain funds through additional equity offerings unsecured debt financings andor mortgage financings and other debt and equity alternatives including formation of jointventures in a manner consistent with our intention to operate with a conservative debt structure in 2003 we undertook several transactions to improve our liquidity including the redemption of 100 million of 795 preferred stock with the proceeds of a common equity offering the redemption and payment in june 2003 of the 75 million of our 5 14 convertible subordinated debentures outstanding and due to mature in october 2003 with borrowings under our lower interest rate credit facility and the refinancing and replacement of our 300 million revolving credit facility and 125 million term loan both scheduled to mature in december 2003 with a new 550 million unsecured credit facility the new credit facility consists of a 150 million fiveyear term loan a 100 million threeyear term loan and a 300 million threeyear revolving credit facility with a oneyear extension option the term loans bear interest at libor plus 95 basis points while the revolving facility bears interest at libor plus 75 basis points see “recent developments” above for a discussion of our financing transactions subsequent to year end 2003 our cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2003 were 350 million an increase from 231 million at december 31 2002 summary of cash flows  

the cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to the operation of our properties and includes 8 million of insurance proceeds related to reimbursement of lost rent at santana row we used cash of 267 million to increase our working capital primarily as a result of an increase in notes receivable and an increase in current assets related to properties acquired   we used net cash of 913 million in investing activities during 2003 consisting of 1398 million of cash provided by investing activities and 2311 million of cash used in investing activities   the net cash provided by our investing activities represents    the net cash used in our investing activities reflects    we expect that capital expenditures for development activities particularly at santana row will decrease in 2004 we are not able to project our level of acquisitions or dispositions in future years but expect that we will be able to fund acquisitions and our redevelopment pipeline through available means of financing 42 

we used net cash of 193 million for financing activities during 2003 consisting of 3247 million used in financing activities and 3054 million of cash provided by financing activities the cash used in financing activities primarily reflects  the cash provided by our financing activities primarily represents  contractual commitments the following table provides a summary of our fixed noncancelable obligations as of december 31 2003

 debt financing arrangements as of december 31 2003 we had total debt outstanding of 13 billion the following is a summary of our total debt outstanding as of december 31 2003 certain additional detailed information about our debt is included in notes 4 5 and 6 of our notes to consolidated financial statements dollars in thousands

 our credit facility and other debt agreements include financial covenants that may limit our operating activities in the future these covenants require us to comply with a number of financial provisions using calculations of ratios and other amounts that are not normally useful to a financial statement reader and are calculated in a manner that is not in accordance with gaap accordingly the numeric information set forth below is calculated as required by our various loan agreements rather than in accordance with gaap we have not included a reconciliation of this information to gaap information because in this case there is no directly comparable gaap measure similarly titled gaap measures are not relevant in determining whether or not we are in compliance with our financial covenants and we believe that the ratios on our material covenants are relevant to the reader these covenants require us to  we are also obligated to comply with other covenants including among others provisions  46 

as of december 31 2003 we were in compliance with all of our financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including the listed covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition our results of operations our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares below are the aggregate principal payments required as of december 31 2003 under our debt financing arrangements by year scheduled principal installments and amounts due at maturity are included  

our organizational documents do not limit the level or amount of debt that we may incur interest rate hedging we enter into derivative contracts which qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” in order to manage interest rate risk derivatives are not purchased for speculation in january 2004 to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our 150 million fiveyear term loan issued in october 2003 we entered into interest rate swaps which fixed the libor portion of the interest rate on the term loan at 2401 through october 2006 the interest rate on the term loan as of december 31 2003 was libor plus 95 basis points thus subsequent to year end we swapped the floating rate debt to a fixed interest rate of 3351 on notional amounts totaling 150 million on the january 2004 hedge we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the interest rate protection agreement should interest rates exceed the cap however management does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty the counterparty has a longterm debt rating of “a” by standard and poor’s ratings service “sp” “a1” by moody’s investors service “moody’s” as of march 8 2004 although our swap is not exchange traded there are a number of financial institutions which enter into these types of transactions as part of their daytoday activities the swap has been documented as a cash flow hedge and designated as effective at inception of the swap contract 47 

consequently the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swap at its fair value will be recorded as a component of other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity and either a derivative instrument asset or liability is recorded on the balance sheet the hedges open at the end of the third quarter 2003 relating to our 125 million term loan which was to mature on december 19 2003 were unwound on october 8 2003 in connection with the repayment of that loan at a cost of approximately 11 million which was charged to interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2003 liquidity requirements shortterm liquidity requirements consist primarily of obligations under capital and operating leases normal recurring operating expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional or replacement debt as well as scheduled debt maturities recurring corporate expenditures nonrecurring corporate expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders overall capital requirements in 2004 and beyond will depend upon acquisition opportunities the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of future phases of santana row we expect to fund our capital requirements as well as our development and redevelopment costs acquisitions and normal recurring operating costs through a combination of cash provided by operating activities borrowings under our credit facility and other funding sources which may consist of additional and replacement debt both secured and unsecured additional equity joint venture relationships and property dispositions we expect to fund our longterm capital requirements which consist primarily of maturities under our longterm debt development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisition opportunities through a combination of funding sources which we believe will be available to us including debt both secured and unsecured additional equity joint venture relationships and property dispositions the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements    reit qualification we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code including the requirement to distribute 90 of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 48 

funds from operations we have historically reported our ffo in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial measure of real estate companies’ operating performance nareit defines ffo as follows income available for common shareholders before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and before extraordinary items less gains on sale of real estate nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that the value of incomeproducing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap however ffo    we consider ffo a meaningful additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits an increase or decrease in ffo does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status however we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable income as defined in the code to remain qualified as a reit therefore a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis 49 

the reconciliation of net income available for common shareholders to funds from operations for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 is as follows  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subject us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital expenditures and other cash requirements we also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt the following discussion of market risk is based solely on hypothetical changes in interest rates related to our variable rate debt this discussion does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect the financial instruments discussed in this section interest rate risk our interest rate risk is most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt at december 31 2003 we had 3591 million of variable rate debt based upon this balance of variable rate debt if interest rates increased 1 our earnings and cash flows for the year would decrease by approximately 36 million if interest rates decreased 1 our earnings and cash flows for the year would increase by approximately 36 million we believe that the change in the fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a foreseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be immaterial to our total assets and total liabilities in january 2004 we purchased an interest rate swap on our 150 million term note which currently bears interest at libor plus 95 basispoints and is due to mature in october 2008 the swap has locked in the libor portion of the interest rate at 2401 through october 2006 interest rate hedging we use derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to manage our fixed to variable rate debt ratio a description of these derivative financial instruments is contained in “item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — liquidity and capital resources  interest rate hedging” and is incorporated by reference into this item 7a 51

business objectives and strategies

     our primary business objective is to own manage redevelop and acquire a
portfolio of commercial retail properties with the dominant property type being
grocery anchored community and neighborhood shopping centers that will

         provide increasing cash flow for quarterly distributions to
          shareholders

         protect investor capital

         provide potential for capital appreciation and

         generate high internal growth as compared to our retail reit peers

     our traditional focus has been on grocery anchored community and
neighborhood shopping centers late in 1994 recognizing a trend of consumer
shopping preferences and retailer expansion to main streets we expanded our
investment strategy to include street retail and mixeduse properties the
mixeduse properties are typically centered around a retail component but may
also include office residential and hotel components in established main
street shopping areas in addition from 1997 through 2001 we undertook the
groundup development of mixeduse projects in urban areas that center around
the retail component on

                                       4 

page

february 28 2002 our board of trustees approved the adoption of a business
plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of owning
managing redeveloping and acquiring community and neighborhood shopping centers
anchored by grocery stores drug stores or high volume value oriented retailers
that provide consumer necessities we will complete our mixeduse projects in
san jose california and bethesda maryland but will not pursue any further
new largescale groundup development projects the pentagon row mixeduse
development project located in arlington virginia was completed during 2002

operating strategies

     our core operating strategy is to aggressively manage our properties to
maintain high occupancy rates and a strong diverse base of tenants our
properties are generally located in some of the most densely populated and
affluent areas of the country these strong demographics help our tenants
generate sales which enables us to maintain higher occupancy rates high rental
rates and consistent rental rate growth all of which lead to increased value
of our portfolio our operating strategies also include

         maintaining a diversified tenant base thereby limiting exposure to
          any one tenants financial difficulties

         monitoring the credit mix of our tenant base to achieve a balance of
          strong national and regional credit tenants with more local specialty
          tenants

         minimizing overhead and operating costs

         monitoring the physical appearance of our properties and the
          construction quality condition and design of the buildings and other
          improvements located on our properties to maximize their effectiveness
          in their individual markets

         developing local and regional market expertise in order to capitalize
          on market and retailing trends

         leveraging the contacts and experience of our management team to build
          and maintain longterm relationships with tenants and financing
          sources

         increasing rental rates through the renewal or releasing of expiring
          leases at higher rental rates and limiting vacancy and

         providing exceptional customer service

investing strategies

     our investment strategy calls for deploying capital at riskadjusted rates
of return that exceed our weighted average cost of capital in projects that have
potential for goingforward net income growth equal to or in excess of that or
our core portfolio of properties our investments primarily fall into one of
following three categories

         renovate expand reconfigure andor retenant our existing properties
          to take advantage of under utilized land and increase our internal
          growth rate

         release anchor tenant spaces with tenants capable or producing higher
          sales and therefore paying higher rents than the prior tenant in
          certain cases this may take the form of expanding an existing tenant
          that is performing well but is occupying an outdated store format and

         acquire community and neighborhood shopping centers located in
          densely populated or growing affluent areas where barriers to entry or
          further development are high with possibilities for enhancing their
          operating performance through renovation expansion reconfiguration
          andor retenanting

investment criteria

     when we evaluate potential redevelopments retenanting expansion and
acquisition opportunities we consider such factors as

         the expected returns in relation to our cost of capital as well as the
          anticipated risk we will face in achieving the expected returns

         the tenant mix at the property tenant sales performance and the
          creditworthiness of those tenants

         the geographic area in which the property is located including the
          population density and household incomes as well as the density and
          income trends in that geographic area

         the current market value of the land buildings and other improvements
          and the potential for increasing those market values

         the physical condition of the land buildings and other improvements
          including the structural and environmental condition

         competitive conditions in the vicinity of the property including
          competition for tenants and the ability to create competing properties
          through new construction or through renovation and

         access to and visibility of the property and potential for new
          widened or realigned roadways on the properties trade area which may
          effect access and commuting and shopping patterns

financing strategies

     our financing strategies are designed to maintain a strong balance sheet
while maintaining sufficient flexibility to fund our operating and investing
activities in the most cost efficient way possible our financing strategies
include

         taking advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt
          reduce interest costs and manage our debt maturity schedule

         actively managing our exposure to variablerate debt

         maintaining a prudent level of overall leverage and an adequate pool
          of unencumbered properties

         utilizing the most advantageous source of capital available to us to

tax status

     we elected under section 856c of the internal revenue code of 1986 as
amended which we refer to as the code to be taxed as a reit under the code
beginning with our taxable year ended december 31 1962 as a reit we are
generally not subject to federal income tax on reit taxable income that we
distribute to our shareholders under the code reits are subject to numerous
organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to
distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income each year we will be subject to
federal income tax on our reit taxable income including any applicable
alternative minimum tax at regular corporate rates if we fail to qualify as a
reit for tax purposes in any taxable year we will also not be permitted to
qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for four years
following the year during which qualification is lost even if we qualify as a
reit for federal income tax purposes we may be subject to certain state and
local income and franchise taxes and to federal income and excise taxes on our
undistributed reit taxable income in addition certain of our subsidiaries are
subject to federal state and local income taxes

governmental regulations affecting our properties

     we and our properties are subject to a variety of federal state and local
environmental health safety and similar laws including

         the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability
          act of 1980 as amended which we refer to as cercla

         the resource conservation  recovery act

         the federal clean water act

         the federal clean air act

         the toxic substances control act

         the occupational safety  health act and

         the americans with disabilities act

     the application of these laws to a specific property that we own will be
dependent on a variety of propertyspecific circumstances including the former
uses of the property the building materials used at each property and the
physical layout of each property under certain environmental laws principally
cercla a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be required
to investigate and clean up certain hazardous or toxic substances
asbestoscontaining materials or petroleum product releases at the property
they may also be held liable to a governmental entity or third parties for
property damage and for investigation and clean up costs such parties incur in
connection with the contamination whether or not the owner or operator knew of
or was responsible for the contamination in addition some environmental laws
create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages
and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination the owner or operator
of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and
injuries resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the site
such costs or liabilities could exceed the value of the affected real estate
the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may
adversely affect the owners ability to sell or lease real estate or to borrow
using the real estate as collateral

                                       7 

page

     our compliance with existing environmental health safety and similar laws
has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the
future in addition we have not incurred and do not expect to incur any
material costs or liabilities due to environmental contamination at properties
we currently own or have owned in the past however we cannot predict the
impact of new or changed laws or regulations on our current properties or on
properties that we may acquire in the future we have no current plans for
substantial capital expenditures with respect to compliance with environmental
health safety and similar laws

competition

     numerous commercial developers and real estate companies compete with us in
seeking tenants for properties and properties for acquisition some of these
competitors may posses greater capital resources than we do however no single
competitor or group of competitors in any of our chosen markets is believed to
be dominant in that market this competition may

         reduce properties available for acquisition or development

         increase the cost of properties available for acquisition or
          development

         reduce rents payable to us

         interfere with our ability to attract and retain tenants

         lead to increased vacancy rates at our properties and

         adversely affect our ability to minimize expenses of operation

     retailers at our properties also face increasing competition from outlet
stores discount shopping clubs and other forms of marketing of goods such as
direct mail internet marketing and telemarketing this competition could
contribute to lease defaults and insolvency of tenants

flourtown pennsylvania and leesburg virginia as of december 31 2002 the

on favorable terms

item 2 properties

general

     as of december 31 2002 we owned or had an interest in 58 community and
neighborhood shopping centers comprising over 12 million square feet primarily
located in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the northeast
and midatlantic united states in addition we owned 55 urban and retail
mixeduse properties comprising over 2 million square feet and one apartment
complex all located in strategic metropolitan markets across the united states
no single property accounted for over 10 of our 2002 total revenue we believe
that our properties are covered by adequate commercial general fire flood and
extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially
reasonable exclusions deductibles and limits

     we operate our business on an asset management model where small focused
teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we have divided our portfolio
of properties into three operating regions the northeast midatlantic and
west each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager with
dedicated leasing property management and financial staff and operates largely
autonomously with respect to day to day operating decisions

tenant diversification

     as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 2100 tenants ranging from
sole proprietors to major national retailers no one tenant or affiliated group
of tenants accounted for more than 25 of our annualized base rent as of
december 31 2002 as a result of our tenant diversification we believe our
exposure to recent bankruptcy filings in the retail sector has not

                                       9

been significant our largest tenant to declare bankruptcy kmart corporation
accounted for less than 1 of our 2002 total revenue and 33 of our leasable
square footage

     on january 15 2003 we announced that three of our five kmart locations
were on the list of 326 stores that kmart intends to close the three properties

demographics at these centers and the rent being paid by kmart we believe that
these spaces can be released on favorable terms

leases lease terms and lease expirations

     our leases are classified as operating leases and typically are structured
to include the monthly payment in advance of minimum rents with periodic
increases percentage rents based on our tenants gross sales volumes and
reimbursement of a majority of onsite operating expenses and real estate taxes
these features in our leases reduce our exposure to higher costs caused by
inflation and allow us to participate in improved tenant sales

     leases on apartments are generally for a period of one year or less retail
property leases generally range from 3 to 10 years however certain leases with
anchor tenants may be longer many of the leases contain provisions allowing the
tenant the option of extending the term of the lease at expiration at rates
which often include fixed rent increases consumer price index adjustments or
other market rate adjustments from the prior base rent our properties
including our recently opened santana row development were 947 leased at
december 31 2002

     the following table sets forth the schedule of lease expirations for our
leases in place as of december 31 2002 for each of the 10 years beginning with
2003 assuming that none of the tenants exercises or has exercised renewal

     on march 20 2003 we estimate that there were 35787 holders of record of
our common shares

     our ongoing operations generally will not be subject to federal income
taxes as long as we maintain our reit status and distribute to shareholders at
least 100 of our taxable income under the code reits are subject to numerous
organizational and operational requirements including the requirement to
distribute at least 90 of reit taxable income state income taxes are not
material

     future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of trustees and
will depend on our actual net income available for common shareholders
financial condition capital requirements the annual distribution requirements
under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of
trustees deems relevant we have paid quarterly dividends to our shareholders
continuously since our founding in 1962 and have increased our annual dividend
rate for 35 consecutive years

     our total annual dividends paid per share for 2002 and 2001 were 1925 per
share and 189 per share respectively the annual dividend amounts are
different from total distributions calculated for tax purposes distributions to
the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal
income tax purposes generally will be taxable to a shareholder as ordinary
dividend income distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and
profits will be treated as a nontaxable reduction of the shareholders basis in
such shareholders shares to the extent thereof and thereafter as taxable
capital gain distributions that are treated as a reduction of the shareholders
basis in its shares will have the effect of deferring taxation until the sale of
the shareholders shares no assurances can be given regarding what portion if
any of distributions in 2003 or subsequent years will constitute a return of
capital for federal income tax purposes during a year in which a reit earns a
net longterm capital gain the reit can elect under code sec 857b3 to
designate a portion of dividends paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends
if this election is made then the capital gain dividends are taxable to the
shareholder as longterm capital gains during 2002 a portion of the
distributions was designated as a capital gain dividend

     following is the income tax status of distributions paid during the years
ended december 31 2002 and 2001 to common shareholders

     distributions on our 795 series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares
and our 85 series b cumulative redeemable preferred shares are payable at the
rate of 19875 and 2125 per share per annum prior to distributions on our
common shares we do not believe that the preferential rights available to the
holders of our preferred shares or the financial covenants contained in our debt
agreements will have an adverse impact on our ability to pay dividends in the
normal course to our common shareholders or to distribute amounts necessary to
maintain our qualification as a reit

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
        of operations

     the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing in item 8 of this
report historical results set forth in selected financial information the
financial statements and supplemental data included in item 6 and item 8 and
this section should not be taken as indicative of our future operations

     this annual report on form 10k contains forwardlooking statements within
the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 section 21e of the
securities exchange act of 1934 and the private securities litigation reform act
of 1995 also documents that we incorporate by reference into this annual
report on form 10k including documents that we subsequently file with the
securities and exchange commission which we refer to as the sec will contain
forwardlooking statements when we refer to forwardlooking statements or
information sometimes we use words such as may will could should
plans intends expects believes estimates anticipates and
continues in particular the risk factors included or incorporated by
reference in this annual report on form 10k describe forwardlooking
information the risk factors describe risks that may affect these statements
but are not allinclusive particularly with respect to possible future events
many things can happen that can cause actual results to be different from those
we describe these factors include but are not limited to

         risks that our tenants will not pay rent

         risks of financing such as our ability to consummate additional
          financings or obtain replacement financing on terms which are
          acceptable to us our ability to comply with our existing financial
          covenants and the possibility of increases in interest rates that
          would result in increased interest expense

         risks normally associated with the real estate industry including
          risks that we may be unable to renew leases or relet space at
          favorable rents as leases expire that new acquisitions and our
          development construction and renovation projects including our
          santana row project may fail to perform as expected that competition
          for acquisitions could result in increased prices environmental
          risks and because real estate is illiquid that we may not be able
          to sell properties when appropriate

         risks that our growth will be limited if we cannot obtain additional
          capital and

         risks related to our status as a real estate investment trust
          commonly referred to as a reit for federal income tax purposes such
          as our obligation to comply with complex tax regulations relating to
          our status as a reit the effect of future changes in reit
          requirements as a result of new legislation and the adverse
          consequences if we fail to qualify as a reit

     given these uncertainties readers are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on these forwardlooking statements or those incorporated into this
annual report on form 10k we also make no promise to update any of the
forwardlooking statements you should carefully review the risks and the risk

critical accounting policies

     the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america which we refer to
as gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain
circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses these estimates
are prepared using managements best judgment after considering past and
current events and economic conditions in addition information relied upon by
management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial
and operating information external market information when available and when
necessary information obtained from consultations with third party experts
actual results could differ from these estimates the most significant
accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to
future uncertainties and therefore may result in actual amounts that differ
from estimates are as follows

revenue recognition and accounts receivable

     leases with tenants are classified as operating leases base rents are
recognized on a straightline basis over the terms of the related leases net of
valuation adjustments based on managements assessment of credit collection
and other business risk we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts
receivable related to base rents including straight line rentals expense
reimbursements and other revenue or income in some cases the ultimate
collectibility of these claims extends beyond one year these estimates have a
direct impact on our net income we believe that our revenue recognition
policies comply with both generally accepted accounting principles and the
securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin no 101 revenue
recognition

real estate

     land buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost
depreciation is computed using the straightline method with useful lives
ranging from three to 50 years on buildings and improvements maintenance and
repair costs are charged to operations as incurred tenant work and other major
improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and
depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the
improvements whichever is shorter certain external and internal costs directly
related to the development redevelopment and leasing of real estate including
applicable salaries and the related direct costs are capitalized the
capitalized costs associated with developments redevelopments and leasing are
depreciated or amortized over the life of the improvement and lease
respectively unamortized leasing costs are charged to operations if the
applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease undepreciated
tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the
tenant work is replaced

     when applicable as lessee we classify our leases of land and building as
operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of statement of
financial accounting standard sfas no 13 accounting for leases we are
required to use judgment and make estimates

                                      24 

page

in determining the lease term the estimated economic life of the property and
the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of sfas no 13 these
estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a
capital lease and is recorded as an asset

     we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of
our real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to
reflect on an annual basis these assessments have a direct impact on net
income should we lengthen the expected useful life of an asset it would be
depreciated over a greater number of years resulting in less annual
depreciation expense and higher annual net income likewise we must make
subjective assumptions as to which costs should be capitalized these
assumptions also have a direct impact on net income

     interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as
part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service
capitalization of interest commences when development activities and
expenditures begin and end upon completion which is when the asset is ready for
its intended use generally rental property is considered substantially
complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements
but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity we
make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and
these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs
are not subtracted in calculating net income if the time period is extended
more interest is capitalized thereby increasing net income

longlived assets

     through december 31 2001 we evaluated the carrying value of our
longlived assets in accordance with sfas no 121 accounting for the
impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of in
cases where particular assets are being held for sale impairment is based on
whether the fair value estimated sales price less costs of disposal of each
individual property to be sold is less than the net book value otherwise
impairment is based on whether it is probable that undiscounted future cash
flows from each property will be less than its net book value if a property is
impaired its basis is adjusted to its estimated fair market value

     in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment
or disposal of longlived assets effective for us on january 1 2002 sfas
no 144 requires that one accounting model be used for longlived assets to be
disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newlyacquired and
broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an
entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished
operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity

     we are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining
whether there is an impairment actual results could be significantly different
from the estimates these estimates have a direct impact on net income because
recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income

contingencies

     we are sometimes involved in lawsuits and environmental matters arising in
the ordinary course of business management makes assumptions and estimates
concerning the amount and

                                      25 

page

likelihood of loss relating to these matters these estimates and assumptions
have a direct impact on net income

outlook

     growth in net income and ffo during 2003 will depend primarily on growth in
the core portfolio growth of net income from the core portfolio depends in
part on the general economy the financial health of our tenants and on our
ability directly or indirectly to control expenses some of which are beyond
our complete control such as snow removal insurance and real estate tax
assessments the current weakening of the retail and overall economic
environment could adversely impact us by increasing vacancies and decreasing
rents in past weak retail and real estate environments however we have been
able to replace weak and bankrupt tenants with stronger tenants management
believes that due to the quality of our properties there will continue to be
demand for our space our properties excluding santana row were 955 leased at
december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 including santana row our occupancy was
947 at december 31 2002

     growth in the core portfolio however will be offset by expenses at
santana row operating and marketing expenses as well as additional
depreciation and interest expense as the project is phased into operations will
have a dilutive effect on 2003 earnings as a result of the august 2002 fire at
santana row as more fully described in this section at santana row the
projected opening of certain retail spaces have been delayed and approximately
50 of the total residential units for the project scheduled to be phased into
service throughout 2003 were destroyed these delayed openings while lowering
the income we will receive will not substantially reduce the costs associated
with maintaining and operating the infrastructure of the project

     growth in net income is also dependent on the amount of our leverage and
interest rates our leverage has increased as we financed our development
projects in addition to the extent variablerate debt is unhedged we will
continue to have exposure to changes in market interest rates although we have
reduced this exposure as of december 31 2002 as compared to december 31 2001
if interest rates increase net income and ffo as well as the ultimate cost of
our development and redevelopment projects will be negatively impacted

2002 property acquisitions and dispositions

acquisitions

     we did not acquire any properties in 2002

dispositions

     on april 11 2002 we sold the street retail property located at 252
greenwich avenue in greenwich connecticut for 165 million resulting in a
gain of 70 million

     on april 30 2002 we sold three street retail properties two in westport
connecticut and one in westfield new jersey for 192 million resulting in a
gain of 69 million

     on june 6 2002 we sold the uptown shopping center located in portland
oregon for 208 million resulting in a gain of 45 million

                                      26 

page

     the proceeds from the sales of the four street retail properties and the
uptown shopping center were used to pay down our syndicated credit facility
except 160 million which was used to pay down the santana row construction
loan as of december 31 2002 all of the proceeds previously held by the
qualified intermediary have been released to us

     on june 18 2002 a partnership in which one of our subsidiaries is the
general partner sold the street retail property located at 6410 hollywood
boulevard in hollywood california for 23 million resulting in a gain of
700000

     on june 20 2002 the proceeds of 6 million previously held by a qualified
intermediary from the 2001 sale of the street retail property located at 101
east oak street in chicago illinois were released to us

2002 financing developments

     on february 1 2002 we received the minority partners interest in santana
row in exchange for a 26 million investment in a partnership we made a 59
million loan to the partnership on january 12 2001 that is due february 28
2003 the loan was not repaid on the due date we are currently exploring all
available options we may have as a result of the borrowers failure to pay at
maturity

     on june 12 2002 we issued 22 million common shares at 2598 per share
netting 566 million after all expenses of the offering

     on november 19 2002 we completed the sale of 150 million of senior notes
in an underwritten public offering under our shelf registration statement
declared effective by the sec on september 30 1998 net proceeds after
deducting the discounts and commissions to the underwriters and other expenses
of this offering totaled approximately 1487 million we used the net
proceeds together with 20 million in available insurance proceeds relating to
the santana row fire and approximately 71 million in borrowings under our
credit facility to pay in full and retire the santana row construction loan
including all interest owed on the loan

santana row

     in 2002 our single largest capital need was the development of santana
row a multiphase mixeduse project being built on 42 acres in san jose
california in the heart of silicon valley the project will consist of
residential retail and hotel components creating a community with the feel of
an urban district

     phase i of the project includes santana row the 1500 foot long main
street and eight buildings which will contain approximately 444000 square feet
of retail space 255 residential units a 213 room hotel and the supporting
infrastructure the first building containing 40000 square feet and occupied
by crate  barrel opened on june 27 2002 six buildings comprising
approximately 317000 square feet of retail space opened on november 7 2002
tenants in the final 87000 square foot building in phase i are expected to
begin opening in early 2003 as of february 4 2003 approximately 320000
square feet or 73 of the phase i retail space is leased of which
approximately 200000 square feet or 46 of the phase i retail space is open

     on august 19 2002 a fire broke out at building seven in the santana row
project building seven contained approximately 87000 square feet of retail
space approximately 1000 parking spaces and 246 residential units all but
eleven of the residential units in the building which were originally scheduled
to open in early 2003 were destroyed the retail units and parking structure
sustained water and smoke damage but were not structurally impaired the opening
of these retail units originally scheduled for september 2002 will be delayed
until early 2003 the damage related to the fire was limited almost entirely to
this single building we believe that our insurance coverage will substantially
cover our losses from the fire we estimate the insurance claim to be in the
range of 70 million to 90 million which includes

                                      27 

page

costs to cleanup repair and rebuild as well as soft nonconstruction costs
and lost rents the cause of the fire is unknown but will not affect our
insurance claim on october 22 2002 a 20 million insurance reimbursement was
advanced by the insurance carrier bringing the total amount received to date to
21 million this advance along with the proceeds from the november 19 2002
note offering and borrowings under our credit facility were used to pay in full
and retire the santana row construction loan because our final insurance claim
has not yet been submitted insurance proceeds expected to be received over and
above those received to date have not been recorded in our december 31 2002
financial statements

     we estimate the total cost of phase i to be approximately 445 million net
of anticipated insurance proceeds insurance proceeds could exceed our 70 to
90 million estimate due to increased fire related costs insurance proceeds
increased by such costs would therefore not reduce our anticipated phase i
investment below 445 million as of december 31 2002 before applying the 21
million of insurance proceeds received to date we have incurred costs of 434
million including the purchase of all of the projects land the construction
of phase i costs associated with the building seven fire and related cleanup
and costs related to future phases of the project we estimate that we will
spend approximately 38 million before insurance reimbursements in 2003
relating to the completion of phase i of the project

     we are evaluating our building seven residential options and alternatives
taking into account costs incurred to date costs to rebuild and market
conditions and believe that we will be able to rebuild a residential component
for building seven on economically favorable terms as part of a future phase of
the project

     the success of santana row will depend on many factors which cannot be
assured and are not entirely within our control these factors include among
others the demand for retail and residential space the cost of operations
including utilities and insurance the availability and cost of capital and the
general economy particularly in the silicon valley

     on february 7 2003 we announced plans for phase ii of santana row which
includes 84000 square feet of retail space on two pad sites and 275 additional
parking spaces 95 of the phase ii retail space has been preleased to best buy
and the container store total development costs are expected to be
approximately 27 million

     we have not determined the scope of future phases of santana row and will
not do so until the success of phase i phase ii and future demand for rental
space is determined however as phases i and ii utilize only part of the retail
and residential entitlements of the property and as phase i includes the costs
of land and infrastructure for future phases we expect to identify and execute
relatively small additional phases on economically favorable terms

new business plan restructuring charges and ceo transition

     on february 28 2002 we adopted a new business plan which returned our
primary focus to our traditional business of acquiring and redeveloping
community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by supermarkets
drug stores or high volume value oriented retailers that provide consumer
necessities we will complete bethesda row and santana row pentagon row was
completed in 2002 but do not plan to develop any new largescale mixeduse
groundup development projects rather we will seek to acquire income producing
centers around our existing markets and will identify and execute redevelopment
opportunities in our existing portfolio concurrent with the adoption of the
business plan we adopted a management succession plan and restructured our
management team

     in connection with this change in our business plan we recorded a charge
of 182 million this charge included a reserve for a restructuring charge of
85 million made up of 69 million of severance and other compensation costs
for several of our senior officers related to the management restructuring as
well as the writeoff of 16 million of development costs all charges against
the reserve totaling 85 million were expended during 2002 an additional
component of the restructuring charge is an impairment loss of 97 million
representing the estimated loss on the abandonment of development projects held
for sale primarily the tanasbourne development project located in portland
oregon thereby adjusting the value of these assets to their estimated fair
value we are marketing these properties for sale the carrying value of these
properties as of december 31 2002 classified on our consolidated balance sheet
as real estate under development is 85 million

     on december 20 2002 we announced the resignation of steven j guttman as
trustee chief executive officer and chairman of the board of trustees effective
january 1 2003 donald c wood our then president and chief operating officer
was named chief executive officer and a member of the board of trustees mark
ordan a member of the board of trustees since 1996 was named nonexecutive
chairman of the board as a result of this transition we recorded a charge of
138 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 for payments and benefits to mr
guttman pursuant to his contractual arrangements with us and for other
transition related costs of this amount 79 had not been paid as of december
31 2002 the majority of which was paid in the first quarter of 2003

     revenue

     total revenues increased 237 million or 80 to 3188 million for the
year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 2951 million for the year ended
december 31 2001 the primary components of the increase in total revenues are
discussed below

     rental income rental income consists of minimum rent percentage rent and
cost recoveries for common area maintenance and real estate taxes the increase
in rental income of 235 million or 86 for the year ended december 31
2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to

         an increase of 81 million in rental income attributable to the
          properties acquired subsequent to january 1 2001 and properties under
          development in 2001 and 2002 which phased into service during 2001 and
          2002 specifically santana row and pentagon row these increases were
          offset by properties sold in 2001 and

         an increase of 154 million or 57 on a same center basis due
          primarily to the increased rental rates at redeveloped and retenanted
          centers as well as increased rental rates associated with lease
          rollovers and higher cost recoveries as a result of increased rental
          expenses and real estate tax expenses

     same center basis for the year ended december 31 2002 excludes the six
properties sold in 2002 the williamsburg shopping center in williamsburg
virginia 101 e oak street in chicago illinois and 7010 austin street in
forest hills new york which were sold in 2001 friendship center in washington
dc which was purchased on september 21 2001 the office building located at
580 market street in san francisco california which was exchanged for the
minority partners interest in santana row and properties under development in
2001 and 2002 including pentagon row in arlington virginia and santana row in
san jose california same center rental income excluding the contribution from
property redevelopments and expansions for the year ended december 31 2002
increased 51 from 2001 reflecting increases due to retenanting lease
rollovers and cost recoveries

     interest and other income interest and other income includes interest
earned on mortgage notes receivable overnight cash investments including
taxdeferred exchange escrow deposits as well as a provision for estimated
losses related to various unconsolidated restaurant joint ventures at santana
row the decrease in interest and other income of 14 million or 218 for
the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31
2001 is attributable to a write down associated with the estimated impairment
of 13 million which represents our best estimate of the diminution of value
based upon the current economic climate surrounding these joint ventures

     other property income other property income includes items which although
recurring tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period such
as utility reimbursements telephone income merchant association dues late
fees lease termination fees and temporary tenant income the increase in other
property income of 16 million or 118 for the year ended december 31 2002
as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to

         a onetime 800000 perpetual easement payment from a residential
          developer that has commenced development on an adjacent site at the
          pentagon row project

         increases of 13 million in parking income utility reimbursements
          and lease termination fees at pentagon row which began phasing into
          service in the second quarter of 2001 santana row which

                                      30 

page

          began phasing into service in the fourth quarter of 2002 and
          friendship center which was purchased in the third quarter
          of 2001 partially offset by

         lower lease termination fees and parking income from properties owned
          and operated in both periods

     on a same center basis other property income decreased 500000 in 2002 as
compared to 2001 as explained above

     expenses

     total expenses increased 363 million to 2701 million for the year ended
december 31 2002 as compared to 2338 million for the year ended december 31
2001 the primary components of the increase in total expenses are discussed
below

     rental expense the increase in rental expense of 109 million or 173
for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31
2001 is attributable to

         an increase of 91 million in noncapitalized operating leasing and
          marketing costs associated with our development projects primarily
          operating preopening and marketing expenses at our santana row
          project as well as increased costs reflecting a full year of
          operating activity at the pentagon row project and

         an increase of 18 million or 31 on a same center basis due
          primarily to increased maintenance insurance and utility costs
          offset by lower bad debt and property management costs

     rental expense as a percentage of rental income and other property income
which we refer to as property income increased slightly from 217 in 2001 to
235 in 2002 due primarily to increased marketing and preopening expenses at
santana row same center rental expense excluding the effect of property
redevelopments and expansions as a percentage of property income decreased
slightly from 200 in 2001 to 196 in 2002 and overall for the year ended
december 31 2002 increased 22 from 2001

     real estate taxes the increase in real estate taxes of 28 million or
100 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended
december 31 2001 is attributable to increased taxes on new development
projects recently redeveloped properties and overall increases in tax
assessments on a same center basis real estate taxes increased 70 due
primarily to increased taxes on recently redeveloped properties and overall
increases in tax assessments at various projects principally woodmont east
fresh meadows garden market and midpike same center real estate taxes
excluding the effect of property redevelopments and expansions for the year
ended december 31 2002 increased 61 from 2001

     property operating income as a result of the changes and variances
explained above operating property income total income less rental expenses
and real estate taxes increased 101 million or 49 to 2141 million for
the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 2040 million for the year
ended december 31 2001

     interest expense in 2002 we incurred interest expense of 886 million
of which 235 million was capitalized yielding interest expense of 651
million as compared to interest of 871 million in 2001 of which 178
million was capitalized yielding interest expense of 693 million the decrease
in interest expense of 42 million or 61 for the year ended december 31
2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 is attributable to

                                      31 

page

         a decrease in the weightedaverage interest rate on our debt from 76
          in 2001 to 74 in 2002 primarily as a result of decrease in interest
          rates on our variable rate debt and

         increased capitalized interest at the santana row project which was
          under construction for the majority of 2002 and began to be phased
          into service beginning with the first tenant opening in june 2002

     administrative expense the decrease in administrative expense of 500000
or 34 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended
december 31 2001 is mostly attributable to lower payroll costs in 2002 as a
result of our corporate restructuring as a result administrative expenses as a
percentage of revenue decreased from 48 in the year ended december 31 2001 to
43 in the year ended december 31 2002

     restructuring charge on february 28 2002 we adopted a new business plan
which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of acquiring and
redeveloping community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by
supermarkets drug stores or high volume value oriented retailers that provide
consumer necessities concurrently with the adoption of the business plan we
adopted a management succession plan and restructured our management team in
connection with this change in business plan we recorded a charge of 182
million this charge included a reserve for a restructuring charge of 85
million made up of 69 million of severance and other compensation costs for
several of our senior officers related to the management restructuring as well
as the writeoff of 16 million of our development costs all charges against
the reserve totaling 85 million were expended during 2002 please see new
business plan restructuring charges and ceo transition for additional
information

     in addition in the fourth quarter of 2002 we recorded a charge of 138
million as a result of the accelerated executive transition whereby donald c
wood the trusts president and chief operating officer replaced steven guttman
as chief executive officer of the trust the fourth quarter charge which
includes an accrual of 79 million at december 31 2002 for payments and
benefits due to mr guttman pursuant to his contractual arrangements with us and
for other transition related costs no cash payments were made against this
charge in 2002 and we expect to expend the majority of the accrual in 2003

     depreciation and amortization expense the increase in depreciation and
amortization expense of 51 million or 86 for the year ended december 31
2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001 reflects the impact of
recent new developments tenant improvements and property redevelopments which
were placed into service throughout 2001 and 2002

     other

     investors share of operations investors share of operations represents
the minority partners interest in the income of certain properties the
decrease in investors share of operations of 11 million or 205 for the
year ended december 31 2002 as compared to the year ended december 31 2001
is attributable to our 2001 purchase of the minority interest in nine street
retail buildings in southern california and three street retail buildings in
forest hills new york and the operating unit holders share of the decrease in
operating income in 2002

     gain on sale of real estate net of loss on abandoned developments held for
sale the approximately 300000 increase in gain on sale of real estate net of
loss on abandoned developments held for sale for the year ended december 31

          million and the exchange of a 90 interest in a street retail building
          for a 10 interest in three street retail buildings with a minority
          partner which resulted in an accounting loss of 500000 in the fourth
          quarter of 2001 primarily offset by

         the impairment loss of 97 million on the abandonment of developments
          held for sale as described under new business plan restructuring

     income from operations of discontinued assets beginning in 2002 sfas no
144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets requires
that gains and losses from dispositions of properties and all operating earnings
from these properties be reported as income from operations of discontinued
assets this also requires that all past earnings applicable to a property
disposed of subsequent to january 1 2002 be reported as income from operations
of discontinued assets as a result previously reported income will be updated
each time a property is sold this requirement is for presentation only and has
no impact on net income as described above in 2002 we sold six properties for
a combined gain of 191 million the earnings generated from these properties
have been reported as income from operations of discontinued assets in
accordance with sfas no 144 income from operations of discontinued assets for
the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 was 13 million and 35 million
respectively with the decrease being primarily due to the fact that these
properties were owned for less than a full year in 2002

     revenue

     total revenues increased 209 million or 76 to 2951 million for the
year ended december 31 2001 as compared to 2742 million for the year ended
december 31 2000 the primary components of the increase in total revenues are
discussed below

     rental income the increase in rental income of 189 million or 74 for
the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to the year ended december 31
2000 is attributable to

         an increase of 29 million in rental income attributable to the
          properties acquired subsequent to january 1 2000 and properties under
          development in 2000 and 2001 which began phasing into service during
          2001 specifically pentagon row and woodmont east these increases
          were offset by properties sold in 2001 and 2000 and

         an increase of 160 million or 64 on a same center basis due
          primarily to the increased rental rates at redeveloped and retenanted
          centers as well as increased rental rates associated with lease
          rollovers and higher cost recoveries

     same center basis for the year ended december 31 2001 excludes the six
properties sold in 2002 because they have been reclassified to income from
operations of discontinued assets on the consolidated statements of operations
the williamsburg shopping center in williamsburg virginia and peninsula
shopping center in palos verdes california which were sold on april 27 2001
and june 30 2000 respectively as well as properties acquired and properties
under development in 2000 and 2001 including friendship center in washington
dc woodmont east in bethesda maryland pentagon row in arlington virginia
214 wilshire boulevard in santa monica california and town  country shopping
center in san jose california which was demolished to make way for the santana
row development

     interest and other income the decrease in interest and other income of
900000 or 125 for the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to the
year ended december 31 2000 is attributable to a decrease in interest earned
on mortgage notes receivable which reflects the 118 million decrease in
mortgage notes receivable from december 31 2000 to december 31 2001

     other property income the increase in other property income of 29
million or 266 for the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to the year
ended december 31 2000 is attributable to

         an approximate 12 million increase in lease termination fees and

         increased parking income and utility reimbursements

     on a same center basis other property income during the year ended
december 31 2001 increased 187 from the year ended december 31 2000

discussed below

     rental expense the increase in rental expense of 71 million or 127
for the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to the year ended december 31
2000 is attributable to

         an increase of 57 million in operating leasing and marketing costs
          associated with our development projects primarily leasing and
          marketing expenses at our santana row project as well as increased
          costs reflecting the increased operating activity at the pentagon row
          and woodmont east projects and

         an increase of 23 million or 43 on a same center basis due
          primarily to general cost increases along with increased property
          management costs in 2001 partially offset by

         a decrease of 900000 in operating costs related to properties
          acquired and sold during the two periods

     rental expense as a percentage of rental income and other property income
which we refer to as property income increased slightly from 209 in 2000 to
217 in 2001 due primarily to the increased leasing and marketing expenses at
santana row

     real estate taxes the increase in real estate taxes of 21 million or
82 for the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to the year ended
december 31 2000 is attributable primarily to increased tax assessments on
recently redeveloped properties partially offset by taxes on properties sold in
2001 and 2000 on a same center basis real estate taxes increased 94
reflecting the increases on redeveloped properties

     property operating income as a result of the changes and variances
explained above property operating income total income less rental expenses
and real estate taxes increased 117 million or 61 to 2040 million for

     interest expense in 2001 we incurred interest expense of 871 million
of which 178 million was capitalized as compared to 2000s 797 million of
which 133 million was capitalized the increase in interest expense of 29
million or 44 for the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to the year
ended december 31 2000 is attributable to

         increased mortgage interest primarily due to the 152 million of
          mortgages placed on five properties in the fourth quarter of 2000
          partially offset by

         a decrease in the weightedaverage interest rate on our debt from 79
          in 2000 to 76 in 2001 primarily as a result of the decrease in
          interest rates on our variable rate debt and

         increased capitalized interest at the santana row project which was
          under construction during 2001

     administrative expense the increase in administrative expense of 10
million or 72 for the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to the year
ended december 31 2000 is attributable to increased personnel costs legal and
accounting fees however administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue
decreased slightly in 2001 to 48 from 49 in 2000

     depreciation and amortization expense the increase in depreciation and
amortization expense of 66 million or 126 for the year ended december 31
2001 as compared to the year ended december 31 2000 reflects the impact of
recent new development tenant improvements and property redevelopments which
were placed in service during the year specifically the pentagon row and
woodmont east developments

     investors share of operations the decrease in investors share of
operations of 13 million or 210 for the year ended december 31 2001 as
compared to the year ended december 31 2000 is attributable to our buyout of
the minority partners in nine street retail buildings in southern california
thereby increasing our ownership in these buildings to 100

     gain on sale of real estate net of loss on abandoned developments held for
sale the increase in gain on sale of real estate net of loss on abandoned
developments held for sale of 55 million for the year ended december 31
2001 as compared to the year ended december 31 2000 is attributable to an
increase in net gains recognized in 2001 from

         the sale of one shopping center in the second quarter of 2001 for a
          gain of 79 million and

         the sale of one street retail property in the fourth quarter of 2001
          for a gain of 18 million partially offset by

         the exchange of our 90 interest in a street retail building to the
          minority partner in exchange for the minority partners 10 interest
          in three other street retail buildings in the fourth quarter of 2001

segment results

     we operate our business on an asset management model where small focused
teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets we have divided our portfolio
of properties into three operating regions the northeast midatlantic and
west each region is operated under the direction of an asset manager with
dedicated leasing property management and financial staff and operates largely
autonomously with respect to day to day operating decisions incentive
compensation throughout the regional teams is tied to the net operating income
of the respective portfolios

     as of december 31 2002 we were in compliance with all of the listed
financial covenants if we were to breach any of our debt covenants including
the listed covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure
period our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately and if the
debt is secured could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the
property securing the loan many of our debt arrangements including our public
notes and our credit facility are crossdefaulted which means that the lenders
under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate
repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain
of our other debt obligations as a result any default under our debt covenants
could have an adverse effect on our financial condition our results of

     we enter into derivative contracts which qualify as cash flow hedges under
sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities in
order to manage interest rate risk derivatives are not purchased for
speculation

     during 2001 to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our 125 million
term loan we entered into interest rate swaps which fixed the libor interest
rate on the term loan at 527 the current interest rate on the term loan is
libor plus 95 basis points thus fixing the interest rate at 622 on notional
amounts totaling 125 million we are exposed to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate protection agreement
should interest rates exceed the cap however management does not anticipate
nonperformance by the counterparties the counterparties have longterm debt
ratings of a or above by standard and poors ratings service sp and aa2 or
above by moodys investors service moodys although our cap is not exchange
traded there are a number of financial institutions which enter into these
types of transactions as part of their daytoday activities the interest rate
swaps mature concurrently with the 125 million term loan on december 19 2003
the swaps were documented as cash flow hedges and designated as effective at
inception of the swap contract consequently the unrealized gain or loss upon
measuring the swaps at their fair value is recorded as a component of other
comprehensive income within shareholders equity and either a derivative
instrument asset or liability is recorded on the balance sheet at december 31
2002 a

cumulative unrealized loss of 46 million representing the difference between
the current market value and the 622 fixed interest rate on the swap was
recorded in other comprehensive income with a corresponding derivative liability
on the balance sheet interest expense of approximately 46 million will be
reclassified from other comprehensive income into current earnings during 2003
to bring the effective interest rate up to 622

     in anticipation of a 150 million senior unsecured note offering on august
1 2002 we entered into a treasury rate lock that fixed the benchmark five year
treasury rate at 3472 through august 19 2002 the rate lock was documented as
a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction and designated as effective at the
inception of the contract on august 16 2002 we priced the senior unsecured
notes with a scheduled closing date of august 21 2002 and closed out the
associated rate lock five year treasury rates declined between the pricing
period and the settlement of the hedge purchase therefore to settle the rate
lock we paid 15 million as a result of the august 19 2002 fire at santana
row we elected not to proceed with the note offering at that time however we
consummated a 150 senior unsecured note offering on november 15 2002 and
thus the hedge loss will be amortized into interest expense over the life of
these notes

1  under the terms of the congressional plaza partnership agreement from and
     after january 1 1986 rockville plaza company rpc an unaffiliated
     third party has the right to require us and the two other minority
     partners to purchase from half to all of rpcs 375 interest in
     congressional plaza at the interests thencurrent fair market value based
     on managements current estimate of fair market value our estimated
     liability upon exercise of the put option is approximately 275 million
     since the timing of this transaction is unknown the put option is excluded
     from our capital requirements

                                      46

     in conjunction with a redevelopment currently taking place at the property
     we have agreed to acquire an additional 75 interest in congressional
     plaza from rpc thereby lowering their ownership percentage to 30 in
     exchange for funding approximately 7 million of rpcs share of the
     redevelopment cost the funding will take place through the first quarter
     of 2003 and the transaction will be completed in 2003 after the completion
     of this transaction our estimated liability upon the exercise of the put
     option will be approximately 22 million

2  under the terms of four partnerships which own street retail properties in
     southern california with a cost of approximately 61 million if certain
     leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the properties owned by the
     partnerships the other partners may require us to purchase their
     partnership interests at a formula price based upon net operating income
     the purchase price may be paid in cash or for two of the partnerships a
     limited number of our common shares at the election of the other partners
     because we may elect to issue common shares in settlement of part of our
     obligations we have excluded these amounts from our capital requirements
     in certain of these partnerships if the other partners do not redeem their
     interest we may choose to purchase the limited partnership interests upon
     the same terms

3  under the terms of various other partnerships which own shopping center
     properties with a cost of approximately 71 million the partners may
     exchange their 796773 operating units for cash or the same number of our
     common shares at our option because we may elect to issue common shares
     in settlement of our obligation we have excluded these amounts from our
     capital requirements during the second quarter of 2002 we issued 100000
     of our common shares valued at 28 million in exchange for 100000
     operating units and cash of 205000 in exchange for an additional 7816
     operating units on february 14 2003 we paid 333000 to redeem an
     additional 12000 operating units

4  street retail san antonio lp a whollyowned subsidiary of the trust
     entered into a development agreement the agreement on march 13 2000
     with the city of san antonio texas the city related to the
     redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along houston street in the
     city houston street and the surrounding area have been designated by the
     city as a reinvestment zone the zone the city has agreed to facilitate
     redevelopment of the zone by undertaking and financing certain public
     improvements based on our agreement to redevelop our properties in the
     zone under the terms of the agreement the city issued debt to fund
     specific public improvements within the zone the initial and primary
     source of funding to the city for repayment of the debt and debt service is
     the incremental tax revenue that accretes to the city as the taxable value
     of the redeveloped properties within the zone increase we are required to
     issue an annual letter of credit commencing on october 1 2002 through
     september 30 2014 that covers our designated portion of the debt service
     should the incremental tax revenue generated not cover the debt service we
     posted a letter of credit with the city on september 25 2002 for 795000
     our obligation under this agreement cannot be determined at this time
     because it is dependent on the annual assessed value of the properties in
     the zone and the related tax revenue generated we were not required to
     provide any funding in 2002 or for the semiannual payment due march 15
     2003 based on the current assessed value of the properties in the zone we
     expect to provide some funding under the agreement prior to its expiration
     on september 30 2014 but anticipate that our obligation will not exceed
     600000 in any year and will be between 2 million

                                      47

     and 3 million in total if the zone creates sufficient tax increment
     funding to repay the citys debt prior to the expiration of the agreement
     we will be eligible to receive reimbursement of amounts paid for debt
     service shortfalls together with interest thereon

     as of december 31 2002 our current contractual payment obligations due
within one year total approximately 403 million included in this amount is
196 million that represents our revolving credit facility and term loan which
mature on december 19 2003 which we plan to renew

     in addition to our contractual obligations we have other shortterm
liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal recurring operating
expenses regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to
additional and replacement debt recurring corporate expenditures
nonrecurring corporate expenditures such as tenant improvements and
redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders overall
capital requirements in 2003 will depend upon acquisition opportunities the
level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing
and cost of future phases of santana row we expect to fund the remaining
capital requirements of 207 million as well as our development and
redevelopment costs acquisitions and normal recurring operating costs through a
combination of cash provided by operating activities borrowings under our
credit facility and other funding sources which may consist of additional debt
both secured and unsecured additional equity joint venture relationships and
property dispositions

     we expect to fund our longterm capital requirements which consist
primarily of maturities under our longterm debt development and redevelopment
costs and potential acquisition opportunities through a combination of funding
sources which we believe will be available to us including debt both secured
and unsecured additional equity joint venture relationships and property
dispositions

     the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity
requirements

         we may be unable to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable
          terms or at all as a result of our financial condition or market
          conditions at the time we seek additional financing

         restrictions on our debt instruments or outstanding equity may
          prohibit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at all or on terms
          available under thenprevailing market conditions and

         we may be unable to service additional or replacement debt due to
          increases in interest rates or a decline in our operating performance

dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan

     we have implemented a dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan which
was subsequently amended in march 2002 the drip under the drip current
shareholders are permitted to elect to reinvest all a portion or none of their
cash dividends to purchase common shares the drip also allows both new
investors and existing shareholders to make optional cash payments to purchase
common shares

     the drip permits current shareholders and new investors to invest a minimum
of 25 up to a maximum of 10000 in common shares per month shares purchased
under the drip through reinvestment of dividends and optional cash payments are
purchased at market price

                                      48 

page

     common shares may be purchased directly from the company or in open market
purchases as we determine from time to time to fulfill the requirements for
the drip we issued 134247 and 159234 common shares under the drip and
received approximately 35 million and 33 million in proceeds for the years
ended december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively

stock purchase plan

     in 1991 the board of trustees of the company approved a stock purchase
plan the espp under section 423 of the code the espp is regarded as a
noncompensatory plan under apb no 25 because it meets the qualifications under
irc 423 under the terms of the espp eligible employees may purchase common
shares of the company at a price that is equal to 90 of the lower of the common
shares fair market value at the beginning or the end of a quarterly period the
fair market value of a common share is equal to the last sale price of the
common shares on the new york stock exchange eligible employees may purchase
the common shares through payroll deductions of up to 10 of eligible
compensation the espp is not subject to the provisions of erisa the espp
terminated on january 31 2001

     under the terms of the espp eligible employees had purchased 446000
common shares at 15125 per share with the assistance of loans of 67 million
from us originally espp called for one sixteenth of the loan to be forgiven
each year for eight years as long as the participant was still employed by us
the loans for all participants but two were modified in 1994 to extend the
term an additional four years and to tie forgiveness in 1995 and thereafter to
certain criteria related to our performance one sixteenth of the loan has been
forgiven during each year of the plan at december 31 2002 we had outstanding
purchase loans to participants of approximately 830000 the purchase loans
bear interest at 939 the shares purchased under the plan may not be sold
pledged or assigned until both the purchase and tax loans associated with the
plan are satisfied and the term has expired without the consent of the
compensation committee of the board of trustees on january 24 2003 a 750000
loan was repaid

reit qualification

     we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section 856c of
the code as a reit we generally will not be subject to corporate federal
income taxes as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code
including the requirement to distribute 90 of our reit taxable income to our
shareholders

funds from operations

     we have historically reported our ffo in addition to our net income and net
cash provided by operating activities ffo is a supplemental nongaap financial
measure of real estate companies operating performance nareit defines ffo as
follows income available for common shareholders before depreciation and
amortization of real estate assets and before extraordinary items less gains on
sale of real estate nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance
and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that the value of
incomeproducing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis
determined under gaap however ffo

                                      49 

page

         does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance
          with gaap which unlike ffo generally reflects all cash effects of
          transactions and other events in the determination of net income

         should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication
          of our performance and

         is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity
          or ability to pay dividends

     we consider ffo a meaningful additional measure of operating performance
because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate
assets diminishes predictably over time and because industry analysts have
accepted it as a performance measure comparison of our presentation of ffo to
similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due
to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such
reits

     an increase or decrease in ffo does not necessarily result in an increase
or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not
required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us
to maintain reit status however we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable
income as defined in the code therefore a significant increase in ffo will
generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not
necessarily on a proportionate basis

     the reconciliation of net income available for common shareholders to
funds from operations for the years ended december 31 2002 and 2001 is as
follows

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     our use of financial instruments such as debt instruments subject us to
market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the
fair value of our assets market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from
changes in interest rates and market prices we manage our market risk by
attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating investing and
financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments
dividends to common and preferred shareholders investments capital
expenditures and other cash requirements we also enter into derivative
financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to mitigate our interest rate
risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate
on a portion of our variable rate debt

     the following discussion of market risk is based solely on hypothetical
changes in interest rates related to our variable rate debt this discussion
does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect the
financial instruments discussed in this section

interest rate risk

     our interest rate risk is most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates
on our variable rate debt at december 31 2002 we had 1218 million of
variable rate debt based upon this balance of variable operating debt if
interest rates increased 1 our earnings and cash flows would decrease by
approximately 12 million if interest rates decreased 1 our earnings and
cash flows would increase by approximately 12 million we believe that the
change in the fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a
foreseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be immaterial to our total
assets and total liabilities

interest rate hedging

     we use derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of our
variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to manage our fixed to variable rate
debt ratio a description of these derivative financial instruments is contained
in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  interest rate
hedging and is incorporated by reference into this item 7a
