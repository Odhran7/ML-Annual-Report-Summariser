the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form 10k should be carefully considered the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face these risks could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations

merger risks 

the merger is subject to conditions some of which may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis if at all failure to complete or unexpected delays in completing the merger or any termination of the merger agreement could have material adverse effects on us 

on november 29 2020 we our whollyowned subsidiary sapphire subsidiary ltd a bermuda exempted company limited by shares  “merger sub” and ihs markit entered into an agreement and plan of merger as amended on january 20 2021 the “merger agreement” pursuant to which merger sub will merge with and into ihs markit with ihs markit surviving such merger as our whollyowned direct subsidiary the completion of the merger is subject to a number of conditions including among other things the receipt of certain regulatory approvals as well as the accuracy of all representations and warranties of ihs markit and the absence of a material adverse effect since the date of the merger agreement which make the completion and timing of the merger uncertain the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the merger will be satisfied or waived or that the merger will be completed 

in addition either sp global or ihs markit may terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances including if the merger is not completed by the outside date determined pursuant to the merger agreement which is may 29 2022 in certain circumstances upon termination of the merger agreement sp global would be required to pay a termination fee of 2380 billion to ihs markit and in certain circumstances ihs markit would be required to pay a termination fee of 1075 billion to sp global upon termination of the merger agreement each as contemplated by the merger agreement 

moreover at any time before or after the completion of the merger and notwithstanding the termination of applicable waiting periods the applicable us or foreign regulatory authorities or any state attorney general could take such action under antitrust or other applicable laws as such party deems necessary or desirable in the public interest such action could include among other things seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties 

in response to feedback from us and foreign regulatory authorities we and ihs markit have agreed to divest certain businesses in order to procure regulatory approval of the merger on july 31 2021 sp global ihs markit and news corporation entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement pursuant to which ihs markit will sell all right title and interest to certain of its pricing information businesses including its oil price information services opis coal metals and mining and petrochem wire businesses to news corporation for a purchase price of 115 billion on december 27 2021 sp global and ihs markit announced agreements to sell ihs markit’s base chemicals business to news corporation for 295 million and sp global’s cusip global services business to factset research systems for 1925 billion sp global has also committed to divest its leveraged commentary and data lcd business together with a related family of leveraged loan indices in connection with a conditional approval for the merger from the european commission the completion of each of these divestiture transactions is subject to a number of conditions including among other things the receipt of certain regulatory approvals which make the completion and timing of these transactions uncertain the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of these transactions for a significant period of time or prevent each from occurring at all there can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of any of these transactions will be satisfied or waived or that these transactions will be completed and if such transactions are not completed it may materially adversely affect the completion of the merger 

if the merger is not completed we may be materially adversely affected and without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the merger will be subject to a number of risks including the following the market price of our common stock could decline if the merger agreement is terminated we will not realize the benefit of the time and resources financial and otherwise committed by our management to matters relating to the merger that could have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from their respective customers suppliers or employees and we will be required to pay our expenses relating to the merger such as legal accounting and financial advisory fees whether or not the merger is completed 

in addition if the merger is not completed we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against such party to perform its obligations under the merger agreement any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock similarly delays in the completion of the merger could among other things result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the merger and could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger and related divestitures are pending which could adversely affect our business and operations 

in connection with the pendency of the merger and related divestitures it is possible that some customers suppliers partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the merger a divestiture or otherwise which could negatively affect our revenue earnings andor cash flow as well as the market price of our common stock regardless of whether the merger or any such divestiture is completed in addition under the terms of the merger agreement we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the merger which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies including the ability in certain cases to acquire or dispose of assets or pay dividends or incur capital expenditures above a certain amount such limitations could adversely our business and operations prior to the completion of the merger 

we may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of sp global and ihs markit or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our existing business with that of ihs markit and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and technological opportunities and operational efficiencies from the merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of or decreases in demand by customers our ability to realize these anticipated benefits is subject to certain risks including whether we will perform as expected the possibility that we paid more for ihs markit than the value we will derive from the merger and the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of ihs markit if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may decline we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected 

the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including managing a larger more complex combined business maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees retaining existing business and operational relationships including customers suppliers and employees and other counterparties as may be impacted by contracts containing consent andor other provisions that may be triggered by the merger and attracting new business and operational relationships consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations including unanticipated issues in integrating financial reporting information technology infrastructure data and content management systems and product platforms communications and other systems coordinating geographically separate organizations including consolidating offices of sp global and ihs markit that are currently in or near the same location harmonizing both companies’ corporate cultures operating practices employee development and compensation programs internal controls compliance programs and other policies procedures and processes addressing possible differences in business backgrounds and management philosophies managing the impact of divestitures and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger which has already been delayed beyond our initial expectations of closing in 2021 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and other adverse impacts which could materially affect the combined company’s business financial condition and results of operations due to legal restrictions sp global and ihs markit are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the merger the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis if at all 

we expect to incur substantial expenses and devote significant resources in connection with the completion of the merger and related divestitures and the integration of the businesses of sp global and ihs markit 

we expect to incur substantial expenses and devote significant resources in connection with the completion of the merger and related divestitures and the integration of a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems of sp global and ihs markit in connection with the merger the management of the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration many of which may be beyond the control of management and which may result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as materially adversely impact the 

anticipated synergies of the merger and the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company the integration process and other disruptions including increased cyber security risk resulting from the merger may also adversely affect the combined company’s relationships with employees suppliers customers distributors and others with whom sp global and ihs markit have business or other dealings and difficulties in integrating the businesses of sp global and ihs markit could harm the reputation of the combined company 

these incremental transactionrelated costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs factors beyond the parties’ control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses many of which by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately some of these expenses have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed 

if the merger is completed our shareholders’ ownership percentage will be diluted 

if the merger is completed we will issue to ihs markit shareholders shares of our common stock as a result of the issuance of these shares of our common stock our shareholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company after the merger and will therefore have a reduced voting interest 

during the pendency of the merger our ability to execute share repurchases will be restricted 

while the merger is pending we will have limited opportunities to launch repurchase programs and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute a repurchase program when a window of opportunity presents itself 

covid19 risks 

the covid19 pandemic and its effects have affected and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

following the outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus “covid19” the world health organization declared a global emergency on january 30 2020 and subsequently declared covid19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 

covid19 has spread globally including in the united states the united kingdom the european union and other jurisdictions in which we operate governments across the world have taken steps to contain the virus by restricting human movement through numerous measures including travel bans and restrictions social distancing quarantines shelter in place orders enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere and business shutdowns including those in response to the outbreaks of the delta variant in the second and third quarters of 2021 and the omicron variant in the fourth quarter of 2021 continuation of the shutdown of businesses and entire industries increases in unemployment implementation of furloughs lost wages across populations and a significant drop in consumer and business spending resulted in a recession in the united states during 2020 while vaccines have become available their availability and their efficacy against the omicron variant and possible future variants are uncertain so it remains difficult to ascertain how covid19 will impact economic activity there are no comparable recent events that can provide guidance as to the effect of the covid19 global pandemic and as a result the ultimate impact of the coronavirus outbreak or a similar health epidemic is uncertain the effects of covid19 have impacted our operations and may ultimately have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future the extent to which the pandemic will continue to affect our businesses financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are uncertain and cannot be predicted 

increased volatility and uncertainty in the global economy and the financial and commodities markets 

the global economy has been disrupted as a result of the ongoing health crisis and the financial and commodities markets have reacted with unprecedented volatility governmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth the success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address the market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity our businesses would be materially and adversely affected in the event of prolonged recessions in the us and other major markets because there are no comparable recent events that can provide guidance on the impact to the global economy we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be impacted moreover the unprecedented volatility observed in the markets since the outset of covid19 may result in sudden unexpected changes in market structures that were not previously anticipated by laws rules regulations or general market practices risks posed to our businesses financial condition and results of operations from volatility in the financial and commodities markets are described in the risk factor below entitled “changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment products changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business financial condition or results of operations” 

decreased demand for our subscription services 

our clients are being impacted to varying degrees some may no longer be in business by the time the covid19 pandemic comes to an end others will face significant spending constraints in order to continue to operate and others may reduce their workforces permanently as a result of the impact on our clients our subscription services may face pricing pressure on renewals delayed renewals and challenges to new sales which would in turn reduce revenue ultimately impacting our results of operations the pandemic has impacted human mobility and among other things has impacted the supply and demand for energy used in transportation which is also impacted by political tensions between large oil producing countries 

this uncertainty could put pressure on platts clients and translate into slower demand for our subscription and related products and services moreover while our business continuity program has been effective to date the current restrictions on human mobility limit our ability to interact with subscribers and effectively demonstrate new products and may have a negative effect on our ability to secure new subscriptions and renewals 

our businesses assess and analyze the impact of economic events 

our divisions are all actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on the quickly evolving economic conditions we are publishing articles and research pieces that attempt to assess the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the world economy and its components both geographic and sectoral in addition we are taking actions including but not limited to rating actions revising the composition of our indices etc consistent with our business procedures in response to the evolving conditions notwithstanding the care we take in carrying out our work the views and assumptions we express the conclusions we draw the actions we take and the work our divisions are producing today are likely to be heavily scrutinized with the benefit of hindsight we have faced significant regulatory and media scrutiny following prior periods of volatility and economic uncertainty such scrutiny has in the past and may in the future impact our reputation brand and credibility and result in government and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries and litigation see the below risk factors entitled “exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” and “our reputation credibility and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace” 

business continuity 

our business continuity program has been effective to date since midmarch 2020 nearly our entire employee population has been working remotely while we have been able to continue our operations during this time maintaining a remote work environment for an extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on our productivity and our ability to meet the needs of our clients and exposes us to operational risks see the below risk factor entitled “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability” moreover given the extent to which we are utilizing a remote working environment we face increased vulnerability although there has not been a cyber attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company to date we have noted an increase in cyber threats targeted at our remote work environment and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future see the below risk factor entitled “we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information” in addition while our employee base currently has adequate resources to pursue new clients or expand existing relationships we have no control over the business continuity resources available to our clients as a result our ability to maintain expand or establish new client relationships may be limited

• we are regularly exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed thirdparty software we deploy in the ordinary course of business such as the recently identified log4j vulnerability while such vulnerability did not result in a material adverse effect on the company it and similar incidents require the us to devote time and resources to remediation on a regular basis notwithstanding our efforts there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a material adverse effect resulting from vulnerabilities in widely deployed software 

• breaches of our or our vendors’ systems and networks whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyber attacks hacking computer viruses or malware employee error malfeasance physical breaches or other actions may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors’ websites applications or data processing or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us our business or our customers in the ordinary course our thirdparties including our vendors are subject to various forms of cyber attacks to date such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact 

• misappropriation improper modification destruction corruption or unavailability of our data and information due to cyber incidents attacks or other security breaches could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation and regulatory actions and lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones 

• although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers clients and employees there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security 

• measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or become obsolete while we have not experienced a material incident to date any material incident could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of customers regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents 

• cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated and include denial of service attacks ransomware phishing attacks and payment fraud despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats certain techniques 

used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched 

• given the extent to which our businesses are privy to material nonpublic information concerning our customers our data could be improperly used including for insider trading by our employees and third party vendors with access to key systems we have experienced insider trading incidents involving employees in the past and it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third party vendors we take precautions to detect and prevent such activity including implementing and training on insider trading policies for our employees and contractual obligations for our third party vendors but such precautions are not guaranteed to deter misconduct any breach of our clients’ confidences as a result of employee or third party vendor misconduct could harm our reputation 

• the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims

• any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in the legislative regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect compile use and publish data and may impact our financial results 

• global privacy data localization and data protection legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition an inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations despite our best efforts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

• certain types of information we collect compile use and publish including offerings in all our businesses and particularly our market intelligence business are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate in addition there is increasing concern among certain privacy and data protection advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters as well as data protection particularly as they relate to individual privacy and perceived national security interests 

• there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy and data protection laws in the us the european union “eu” and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information of our employees vendors and customers and other data 

• failure to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties the eu’s comprehensive general data privacy regulation “gdpr” for example provides for penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue although the market is yet to see a penalty at the very top end of this range such laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may also be costly to comply with result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

• our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

• we devote meaningful time and financial resources to compliance with current and future applicable international and us privacy cybersecurity data protection and related laws we have made capital investments and other expenditures to address cybersecurity preparedness and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached but there can be no assurance that we will not need to make significant additional expenditures these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

• in addition the eu and other jurisdictions including the people’s republic of china are considering imposing or have already imposed additional restrictions including in relation to crossborder transfers of personal and other types of data these requirements are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which could result in greater compliance risk and cost for us 

• continued privacy and data protection concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations future laws and regulations with respect to the collection compilation use and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations increased compliance or litigation expense adverse publicity or loss of revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations it is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data which could affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs 

• we may also from time to time be subject to or face assertions that we are subject to additional obligations relating to personal and other data by contract or due to assertions that selfregulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices 

exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• in the normal course of business both in the united states and abroad we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries as discussed under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this annual report on form 10k and in note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  in this annual report on form 10k and we face the risk that additional proceedings investigations and inquiries will arise in the future 

• many of these proceedings investigations and inquiries relate to the activity of our ratings indices and platts businesses in addition various government and selfregulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those related to our regulated activities and antitrust matters 

• any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• in view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments damages fines penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be as a result we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses as the case may be we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on our consolidated financial condition cash flows business and competitive position which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods 

• legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues 

• risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the united states in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the company in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increasing regulation of our ratings business in the united states europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• the financial services industry is highly regulated rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the united states europe and elsewhere the businesses conducted by ratings are in certain cases regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 the “reform act” the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” the us securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” andor the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business 

• in the past several years the us congress the international organization of securities commissions iosco the sec the european commission including through the european securities market authority esma and the uk financial conduct authority “fca” as well as regulators in other countries in which ratings operates have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies other laws regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies 

• these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which we may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations we may be required to incur significant expenses andor take actions inconsistent with our business objectives in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact 

of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers’ businesses and they may affect ratings’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which ratings’ ratings are developed affect the manner in which ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business each of these developments increases the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized 

• additional information regarding rating agencies is provided under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this annual report on form 10k 

our indices and platts businesses are subject to new and evolving regulatory regimes in europe and the potential for increased or changing regulations in the united states and elsewhere our indices business is subject to a new regulatory regime in australia our indices and platts businesses are subject to additional regulation in europe this changing regulatory landscape can increase our exposure compliance risk and costs of doing business globally and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• in addition to the extensive and evolving us laws and regulations foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries 

• in october of 2012 iosco issued its principles for oil price reporting agencies pra principles which iosco states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members platts has taken steps to align its operations with the pra principles and as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles has aligned to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks 

• in july of 2013 iosco issued its principles for financial benchmarks financial benchmark principles which are intended to promote the reliability of the benchmark determination process by setting standards related to benchmark governance benchmark quality transparency and accountability mechanisms including with regard to the indices and benchmarks published by indices indices has taken steps to align its governance regime control framework and operations with the financial benchmark principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the financial benchmark principles 

• the benchmark industry is subject to regulation in the eu the “eu benchmark regulation” as well as the evolving regulation of financial and commodity benchmarks in other jurisdictions the eu benchmark regulation was published on june 30 2016 with provisions applicable to indices and platts effective from january 1 2018 esma published additional guidance clarifying that existing benchmark administrators such as platts could utilize the transitional provisions contained in the eu benchmark regulation which provided them two 2 years to implement and seek authorization by an eu national competent authority by january 1 2020 with their respective benchmark activities in europe indices and platts are now both supervised by the netherlands authority for the financial markets this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations greater compliance risk and costs for indices and platts but they are not expected to be material at this time 

• indices is subject to the benchmark regulation in australia under which it is required to obtain a license from and be subject to the supervision of the australian securities and investment commission regarding its administration of the sp asx 200 index this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations greater compliance risk and costs for indices but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear 

• the eus package of legislative measures called the markets in financial instruments directive and regulation collectively mifid ii entered into force in 2014 revising and updating the prior markets in financial instruments directive 2004 and its associated secondary legislation the substantive provisions of mifid ii apply in all eu member states since 2018 mifid ii includes provisions that among other things i mandate conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks for the purposes of clearing related securities and provide for nondiscriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses for this purpose ii modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives iii expand the categories of trading venues that are subject to regulation iv require the unbundling of investment research from other services including execution services and direct that investment firms must pay for research either out of a dedicated research payment account which is paid for by clients or from the investment firm’s profits and v provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the eu market infrastructure regulation of 2011 or emir the mifid ii package may result in changes to the manner in which sp dow jones indices and platts license their indices and price assessments respectively and could also have an indirect impact on the credit ratings and thirdparty research products offered by other divisions of the company for use within the eu mifid ii and the market abuse regulation “mar” may impose additional regulatory burdens on the activities of sp dow jones indices and platts in the eu although the exact impact and costs are not yet known 

our international business activities must comport with us international trade restraints including economic sanctions regulations administered by the us treasury department’s office of foreign assets controls 

• as a global company headquartered in the us we are subject to us laws and regulations including economic sanction laws these laws include prohibitions or restrictions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries regions governments persons and entities 

• embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to iran russia and venezuela these embargoes and sanctions laws may affect our ability to continue to market andor sell our products and services into these geographies and in turn adversely impact our revenue from such geographies

• failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties and related material adverse effects on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results 

• in addition to the merger we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our company such transactions present significant challenges and risks as the market for acquisitions and other strategic transactions is highly competitive especially in light of industry consolidation which may affect our ability to complete such transactions 

• if we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

• if such transactions are completed the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions for instance the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated we may assume unintended liabilities there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations 

• the failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients 

• some of our products support the investment processes and other activities of our clients which in the aggregate manage trillions of dollars of assets use of our products as part of such activities including the investment process creates the risk that clients or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• the products we develop or license and the proprietary methodologies models and processes on which these products rely may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing andor other quality assurance practices such errors may exist during any part of a product’s life cycle and may persist notwithstanding testing andor other quality assurance practices ineffective or insufficient collaboration within the company increases the risk that such errors may not be detected deploying products containing such errors may damage our reputation and the costs associated with remediating such errors may have an impact on our profitability 

• any claim relating to our products even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us would involve a significant commitment of our management personnel financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation in addition such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue 

• the markets for credit ratings financial research market data indexbased products and commodities price assessments and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive ratings market intelligence platts and indices compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of their offerings client service reputation price geographic scope range of products and technological innovation 

• while our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers including exchanges we also face competition from nontraditional providers such as asset managers investment banks and technologyled companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses 

• in addition in some of the countries in which ratings competes governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers 

• sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of platts’ revenue including subscription and licensing fees 

introduction of new or enhanced products and services could impact our profitability 

• we operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs 

• in order to maintain a competitive position we must continue to invest in new offerings and enhancements including new ways to deliver our products and services 

• these new or enhanced offerings resulting from our investments may not achieve market acceptance may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically 

• we could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate 

our ability to develop adapt or implement new and improved processes and technology may adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

• the rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which we operate to succeed in the future we will need to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate design develop assemble test market and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner 

• innovation and constant development in support of new products and enhancements to existing products calls for the implementation of new and improved processes and technologies that require related change management efforts while we employ a certain level of internal and external resources to mitigate the risks associated with implementing process and technology improvements we may face unexpected challenges in execution that may require more management attention than expected thus diverting management time and energy from other businesses the foregoing and other unforeseen factors could also result in business being disrupted for a period of time as well as additional commitments of financial resources 

• enhancing existing products and developing new products often requires effective collaboration across various functions and business lines of the company ineffective or insufficient collaboration across functions and business lines decreases our ability to expand geographically enhance products innovate increase sales leads to brand confusion and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

a significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

• our major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments 

• we offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require 

• we make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues 

• although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability or effectiveness of these investments despite our existing strategies and while not material to our operations we did experience increased attrition in 2021 

increased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• in recent years more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available particularly through the internet and advances in public cloud computing and open source software is expected to continue 

• public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information can reduce demand for our products and services demand could also be reduced as a result of costcutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations although we believe our products are enhanced by our analysis tools and applications our financial results may be adversely affected if our customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services 

consolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth 

• our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate financial services and commodities industries the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base 

• our customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services if a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

• alternatively customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors including by selecting other vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services if customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other 

vendors and not us if we lose business to lower priced competitors or if customers elect to selfsource their product and service needs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

• a material portion of our revenues in our indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchangetraded funds a loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

• our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers some of our products and their related value are dependent upon updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon continuing access to historical and current data 

• we utilize certain data provided by thirdparty data sources in a variety of ways including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world 

• if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position 

• we consider many of our products and services to be proprietary failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm the value of and revenue generated by such assets as well as our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively businesses we acquire may also have intellectual property portfolios which increase the complexity of managing our intellectual property portfolio and protecting our competitive position 

• our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and misappropriation our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets for example we do business in a number of countries included on the priority watch list maintained by the office of the united states trade representative and which are currently thought to afford less protection to intellectual property rights generally than some other jurisdictions the lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in such jurisdictions referenced above may significantly increase our vulnerability as regards unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position 

• our products also contain intellectual property of third party sources any violation by us of the intellectual property rights of such third parties could result in termination of the relevant source agreement litigation and reputational damage which could materially and adversely affects our business financial condition or results of operations 

future legislation regulatory reform or policy changes especially abrupt changes could have a material effect on our business and results of operations 

future legislation regulatory reform or policy changes such as financial services regulatory reform us oil regulation governmentsponsored enterprise reform and increased infrastructure spending and significant changes in trade policy including sanctions could impact our business changes in legislation regulation or policy increase the likelihood that we will fail to appropriately adapt to changes in our compliance obligations particularly when such changes happen abruptly such as following a change in government any of the forgoing changes could impact our results of operations and cash flows directly such changes may also impact our business by creating increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial and commodities markets at this time we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory changes and economic conditions relating to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

• the united kingdom’s exit from the eu on january 31 2020 “brexit” could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the uk and the eu as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and the eu determines how to treat regulated activities eg the activities of credit rating agencies originating in the uk our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in europe potential changes in eu regulation divergent interpretations by the uk of any replicated eu 

laws andor additional regulation in the uk could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses 

• changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit could adversely affect our ability to retain talent for our european operations 

• any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows the lack of certainty creates the risk that notwithstanding that we have devoted valuable resources to a thorough preparation for the impact of brexit on our european operations we may not be adequately prepared for an unforeseen outcome 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

• in addition to the covid19 risks outlined above should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane flood civil unrest protests terrorist attack another outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases security breach cyber attack data breach power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our ability to continue to operate will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

• we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

outsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs 

• we have outsourced certain functions to thirdparty service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies and such functions may be further outsourced outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the thirdparty service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss higher costs regulatory actions and reputational harm 

• outsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the thirdparty service providers may not maintain adequate physical technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data regulatory penalties and remedial costs 

• we also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with whom we do business and to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality including thirdparty cloud infrastructure our cloud infrastructure providers or other service providers could experience system breakdowns or failures outages downtime cyber attacks adverse changes to financial condition bankruptcy or other adverse conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation thus our plans to increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to “the cloud” or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure 

we rely heavily on network systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers 

• many of our products and services are delivered electronically and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computerbased networks our customers also depend on the continued capacity reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems our websites and the internet 

• our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures malicious or defective software human error natural disasters service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation 

• delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers in addition a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers 

• although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers our systems are not always fully redundant and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective as such these disruptions may affect our ability to store handle and secure such data and information 

our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located including new york city the location of our headquarters and major cities worldwide in which we have offices 

• this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest war or otherwise our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful 

• we rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases systems and applications to support key product and service offerings we believe we have appropriate policies processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems 

• we also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer 

• we cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

inability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly our business is dependent on successfully attracting retaining and training talented employees in a highly competitive business environment if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected 

our reputation credibility and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace

legal and regulatory environment 

general 

ratings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets in which it operates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers we have reviewed the new laws regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented or are planning to implement changes as required we do not believe that such new laws regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations other laws regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local national foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings remuneration and rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies the impact on us of the adoption of any such laws regulations or rules remains uncertain but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to ratings’ rating activities or adversely affect our ability to compete andor our remuneration or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings 

in the normal course of business both in the us and abroad ratings or the legal entities comprising ratings are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries many of these proceedings investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities in addition various government and selfregulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into ratings’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition cash flows business or competitive position

additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013 commonly referred to as cra3 these rules among other things 

• impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers 

• require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations 

• impose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer 

• impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed and 

• impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services 

the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the eu 

other jurisdictions 

outside of the us and the eu regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements this includes the uk which has established a credit rating agencies oversight regime similar to that in place in the eu and where ratings was granted registration with the financial conduct authority on january 1 2021 regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future

revenue increased 4 and was unfavorably impacted by less than 1 percentage point from the net effect of recent acquisitions of enerdata and live rice index and the disposition of rigdata revenue increased primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by both expanded product offerings to our existing customers combined with enhanced contract terms additionally an increase in sales usagebased royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges due to increased trading volumes in the first half of 2020 contributed to revenue growth these increases were partially offset by a decrease in conference revenue as a result of cancellation and postponement of events due to covid19 international revenue grew and us revenue remained relatively unchanged compared to 2019 with the us revenue growth rate being unfavorably impacted by the disposition of rigdata in july of 2019 petroleum continues to be the most significant revenue driver followed by natural gas power  renewables metals  agriculture and petrochemicals also contributing to revenue growth foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point

industry highlights and outlook 

in 2021 sustained demand for market data and market insight products led by petroleum continued to drive revenue growth platts introduced sp platts dimension pro in 2021 that provides a fully integrated user experience connecting pricing market commentary news and analytics additionally platts introduced several new esg related products in 2021 platts continues to focus on developing new product and product features leveraging technology investments and developing key product offerings in esg 

legal and regulatory environment 

platts’ commodities price assessment and information business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny as discussed below under the heading “indiceslegal and regulatory environment” the benchmarks industry is subject to the new regulation in the eu the “eu benchmark regulation” as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions platts has obtained authorization and is now supervised by the dutch authority for the financial markets in the netherlands under the eu benchmark regulation will likely need to take similar steps in other jurisdictions including the united kingdom when the transitional period under the eu benchmark regulation and its uk equivalent ends as well as in jurisdictions outside of europe if they pass similar legislation for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our platts business see item 1a risk factors in this annual report on form 10k 

european union 

the eu has enacted mifid ii which revise and update the existing eu markets in financial instruments directive and the substantive provisions became applicable in all eu member states as of january 3 2018 mifid ii includes provisions that among other things i impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for nondiscriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses ii modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives iii expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation iv require the unbundling of investment research and direct how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm’s profits and v provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the eu market infrastructure regulation of 2011 although the mifid ii package is “framework” legislation meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures including some technical standards yet to be adopted by the european commission the introduction of the mifid ii package may result in changes to the manner in which platts licenses its price assessments mifid ii and the market abuse regulation mar may impose additional regulatory burdens on platts activities in the eu over time but they have not yet resulted in increased substantive impact or costs 

in october of 2012 iosco issued its principles for oil price reporting agencies pra principles which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members platts has aligned its operations with the pra principles and as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles has aligned to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks

indices 

indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets 

indices derives revenue from assetlinked fees when investors direct funds into its proprietary designed or owned indexes sales usagebased royalties of its indices and to a lesser extent data subscription arrangements specifically indices generates revenue from the following sources 

• investment vehicles — assetlinked fees such as etfs and mutual funds that are based on the sp dow jones indices benchmarks that generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds

the following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended december 31 

1 2021 includes recovery of leaserelated costs of 1 million 2020 includes employee severance charges of 5 million a lease impairment charge of 4 million a technologyrelated impairment charge of 2 million and leaserelated costs of 1 million 2021 2020 and 2019 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 6 million 

2021 

revenue at indices increased 16 primarily due to higher average levels of assets under management aum for etfs and mutual funds and higher data subscription revenue partially offset by lower exchangetraded derivative revenue average levels of aum for etfs increased 44 to 2419 trillion and ending aum for etfs increased 40 to 2796 trillion compared to 2020 while exchangetraded derivative activity was impacted by both lower average daily trading volume from reduced volatility and lower rates per trade from a shift in product mix in the first half of 2021 foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point 

operating profit increased 20 excluding the impact of employee severance charges in 2020 of 1 percentage point a lease impairment charge in 2020 of 1 percentage point and higher leaserelated costs in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point operating profit increased 17 the impact of revenue growth and lower legal related costs was partially offset by higher cost of sales higher incentive costs and an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit increases foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point 

revenue increased 8 primarily due to higher average levels of aum for etfs and mutual funds an increase in exchangetraded derivatives revenue and higher data subscription revenue partially offset by lower overthecounter derivative revenue average levels of aum for etfs increased 12 to 1681 trillion and ending aum for etfs increased 18 to 1998 trillion compared to 2019 

operating profit grew 5 excluding the impact of employee severance charges in 2020 of 1 percentage point and a lease impairment charge in 2020 of 1 percentage point operating profit increased 7 the impact of revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in compensation costs due to annual merit increases and additional headcount as well as professional costs higher incentive costs and an increase in legal related costs partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from nonessential travel restrictions in response to covid19 and lower cost of sales foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point 

industry highlights and outlook 

indices continues to be the leading index provider for the etf market space in 2021 higher average levels of aum for etfs contributed to revenue growth in 2021 indices continued to launch new esg etfs and expand innovative index offerings with key index product launches indices continues to focus on developing key product offerings in esg multiassetclass and factor indices and developing new product and product features leveraging technology investments 

legal and regulatory environment 

over the past four years the financial benchmarks industry has been subject to specific benchmark regulation in the european union the eu benchmark regulation and australia the australia benchmark regulation other jurisdictions are also considering new regulation for financial benchmarks 

the eu benchmark regulation was published june 30 2016 and included provisions applicable to indices and platts both indices and platts have established separate benchmark administrators in connection with their benchmark activities in europe the indices and platts entities are both based in amsterdam and are authorized by the dutch authority for financial markets afm this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear 

the australian benchmark regulation was enacted in june of 2018 and included provisions applicable to indices designating the sp asx 200 a significant financial benchmark and therefore requiring indices as the administrator of the sp asx 200 to obtain a license from the australian securities and investment commission “asic” indices has obtained the relevant license although narrower in scope the requirements of the australian benchmark regulation are similar to those of the eu benchmark regulation this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear 

in july of 2013 the iosco issued financial benchmark principles iosco principles intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmark determinations the iosco principles address governance benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms including with regard to the indices published by indices even though the iosco principles are not binding law 

indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the iosco principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of such alignment 

the markets for index providers are very competitive indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of its benchmark indices client service reputation price range of products and services including geographic coverage and technological innovation our indices business is impacted by market volatility asset levels of investment products tracking indices and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives volatile capital markets as well as changing investment styles among other factors may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product

liquidity and capital resources 

we continue to maintain a strong financial position our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators in 2022 cash on hand cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future we use our cash for a variety of needs including but not limited to ongoing investments in our businesses strategic acquisitions share repurchases dividends repayment of debt capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure 

cash flow overview 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash were 65 billion as of december 31 2021 an increase of 24 billion as compared to december 31 2020 



in 2021 and 2020 free cash flow remained unchanged at 33 billion free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects see “reconciliation of nongaap financial information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities remained unchanged at 36 billion compared to 2020 as higher operating results in 2021 were offset by the acceleration of payments to vendors higher incentive compensation payments and higher income tax payments 

cash provided by operating activities increased to 36 billion in 2020 as compared to 28 billion in 2019 the increase is mainly due to higher results from operations in 2020 and improved cash collections on accounts receivable in 2020 

investing activities 

our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions 

cash used for investing activities decreased to 01 billion for 2021 as compared to 02 billion in 2020 primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions in 2020 for the esg ratings business from robecosam and greenwich associates llc 

cash used for investing activities increased to 02 billion for 2020 as compared to 01 billion in 2019 primarily due to cash used for the acquisitions of the esg ratings business from robecosam and greenwich associates llc in 2020 

refer to note 2 – acquisitions and divestitures to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further information 

financing activities 

our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases dividends and repayment of shortterm and longterm debt while cash inflows are primarily inflows from longterm and shortterm debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

cash used for financing activities decreased to 10 billion in 2021 from 22 billion in 2020 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases in 2021 

cash used for financing activities increased to 22 billion in 2020 from 18 billion in 2019 the increase is primarily attributable to cash used for the redemption and extinguishment of the 900 million outstanding principal amount of our 44 senior notes due in 2026 and a portion of the outstanding principal amounts of our 655 senior notes due in 2037 and our 45 senior notes due in 2048 in 2020 partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2020 see note 5 — debt to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further discussion 

during 2021 we did not use cash to purchase any shares we expect to resume share repurchases following the expected closing of the merger with ihs markit 

during 2020 we used cash to repurchase 40 million shares for 1164 million we entered into two accelerated share repurchase asr agreements with a financial institution on february 11 2020 to initiate share repurchases aggregating 500 million each we repurchased a total of 17 million shares under each asr agreement for an average purchase price of 29213 per share 

during 2019 we received 59 million shares including 04 million shares received in january of 2019 related to our october 29 2018 asr agreement resulting in 1240 million of cash used to repurchase shares we entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution on august 5 2019 to initiate share repurchases aggregating 500 million we repurchased a total of 20 million shares under the asr agreement for an average purchase price of 25336 per share we entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution on february 11 2019 to initiate share repurchases aggregating 500 million we repurchased a total of 23 million shares under the asr agreement for an average purchase price of 21465 per share 

on january 29 2020 the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares the 2020 repurchase program which was approximately 12 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time on december 4 2013 the board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 50 million shares the 2013 repurchase program which was approximately 18 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options as of december 31 2021 30 million shares remained available under the 2020 repurchase program and 08 million shares remained available under the 2013 repurchase program 

see note 9 — equity to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further discussion related to our asr agreements 

additional financing 

on april 26 2021 we entered into a revolving 15 billion fiveyear credit agreement our credit facility that will terminate on april 26 2026 this credit facility replaced our revolving 12 billion fiveyear credit facility our previous credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on june 30 2022 the previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective there were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced 

we have the ability to borrow a total of 15 billion through our commercial paper program which is supported by our credit facility as of december 31 2021 and 2020 there was no commercial paper issued or outstanding and we similarly did not draw or have any borrowings outstanding from the credit facility or the previous credit facility during the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 

commitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions tested annually we currently pay a commitment fee of 9 basis points the credit facility also includes an accordion feature which allows the company to increase the total commitments thereunder by up to an additional 500 million subject to certain customary terms and conditions the credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default the occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility 

the only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility was not greater than 4 to 1 and this covenant level has never been exceeded 

mergerrelated financing 

on november 16 2021 we launched an offer the “exchange offer” to exchange outstanding notes issued by ihs markit for new notes issued by us and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by standard  poor’s financial services llc with the same interest rate interest payment dates maturity date and redemption terms as each corresponding series of exchanged ihs markit notes and cash the approximately 46 billion in aggregate principal amount of ihs markit’s notes subject to the exchange offer range in maturities from 2022 to 2029 the exchange offer is conditioned upon closing of the merger and we expect to extend the exchange offer until closing of the merger as of january 26 2022 9583 of the ihs markit notes had been tendered 

in conjunction with the exchange offer we successfully solicited consents to amend each of the indentures governing the ihs markit notes to among other things eliminate certain covenants restrictive provisions events of default and the obligation to offer to repurchase the ihs markit notes upon certain change of control transactions these amendments become operative upon the settlement of the exchange offer 

following the merger we expect to raise additional capital including by issuing new senior notes of various maturities potentially ranging from 5 years to 40 years in an aggregate principal amount up to 6 billion portions of which we expect to use to refinance existing indebtedness we also expect to exercise the accordion feature under our existing credit facility to increase the total commitments thereunder by an additional 500 million 

mergerrelated costs 

in 2022 we will continue to incur costs associated with the anticipated merger with ihs markit including certain transaction costs upon completion of the merger that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022 

dividends 

on january 26 2022 the board of directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of 077 per share following the expected closing of the merger with ihs markit the board of directors will revisit the dividend policy of the combined company

summarized results of operations for the year ended december 31 is as follows 



summarized balance sheet information as of december 31 is as follows 



contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flows expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2022 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2021 over the next several years additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table 



1 our debt obligations are described in note 5 – debt to our consolidated financial statement 

2 see note 13 – commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our operating lease obligations  

3 other consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing and certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance 

as of december 31 2021 we had 147 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because until formal resolutions are reached reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2021 we have recorded 3429 million for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 9 – equity to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cme group index services llc cgis has the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2021 we contributed 11 million to our retirement plans expected employer contributions in 2022 are 11 million and 3 million for our retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2022 we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 7 – employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock 

the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow 





critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

under asc 606 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services see note 1  accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 17 million 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we incorporated the forecasted impact of future economic conditions into our allowance for doubtful accounts measurement process including the expected adverse impact of covid19 on the global economy based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2022 

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 44 billion and 46 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a quantitative impairment test if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge for 2021 based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset if the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial 

position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

• discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on highgrade corporate longterm bonds 

• the expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the longterm 

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



as of december 31 2021 the company had 15 billion in pension benefit obligation a 025 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in an estimated decrease or increase to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately 50 million and an increase or decrease in 2022 pension expense of approximately 1 million an increase or decrease of 1 percentage point in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease or increase of approximately 15 million to 2022 pension expense 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income there were no stock options granted in 2021 2020 and 2019 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2022 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits 

as of december 31 2021 we have approximately 29 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of which 08 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available the more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture include an estimated discount rate a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows eg the revenue growth rates and operating margins and a company specific beta the significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models are forwardlooking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions 

as of december 31 2021 the company had 34 billion in redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet the ultimate amount paid for the redeemable noncontrolling interest in indices business could be significantly different because the redemption amount depends on the future results of operations of the business 

as of december 31 2021 the weighted average cost of capital used in the companys income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 9 a 025 percentage point increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would decrease or increase the redemption value by approximately 80 million as of december 31 2021 the terminal growth rate used in the companys income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 22 a 025 percentage point increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the redemption value by approximately 50 million

 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates we have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates during the twelve months ended december 31 2021 we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing these contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets therefore we classify these derivative contracts within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes see note 6 – derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further discussion

in addition if the merger is not completed we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against such party to perform its obligations under the merger agreement any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock similarly delays in the completion of the merger could among other things result in 

additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the merger and could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business financial condition results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending which could adversely affect our business and operations 

in connection with the pendency of the merger it is possible that some customers suppliers partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the merger or otherwise which could negatively affect our revenue earnings andor cash flow as well as the market price of our common stock regardless of whether the merger is completed in addition under the terms of the merger agreement we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the merger which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of its business strategies including the ability in certain cases to acquire or dispose of assets or pay dividends or incur capital expenditures above a certain amount such limitations could adversely our business and operations prior to the completion of the merger 

we may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of sp global and ihs markit or realize the anticipated benefits of the merger 

the success of the merger will depend in part on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our existing business with that of ihs markit and realize the anticipated benefits including synergies cost savings innovation and technological opportunities and operational efficiencies from the merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of or decreases in demand by customers our ability to realize these anticipated benefits is subject to certain risks including whether we will perform as expected the possibility that we paid more for ihs markit than the value we will derive from the merger and the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of ihs markit if we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may decline we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected 

the integration of the two companies may result in material challenges including managing a larger more complex combined business maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees retaining existing business and operational relationships including customers suppliers and employees and other counterparties as may be impacted by contracts containing consent andor other provisions that may be triggered by the merger and attracting new business and operational relationships consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations including unanticipated issues in integrating financial reporting information technology infrastructure data and content management systems and product platforms communications and other systems coordinating geographically separate organizations including consolidating offices of sp global and ihs markit that are currently in or near the same location harmonizing both companies’ corporate cultures operating practices employee development and compensation programs internal controls compliance programs and other policies procedures and processes addressing possible differences in business backgrounds and management philosophies and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the merger 

many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and other adverse impacts which could materially affect the combined company’s business financial condition and results of operations due to legal restrictions sp global and ihs markit are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the merger the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis if at all 

we expect to incur substantial expenses and devote significant resources in connection with the completion of the merger and the integration of the ihs markit and our businesses 

we expect to incur substantial expenses and devote significant resources in connection with the completion of the merger and the integration of a large number of processes policies procedures operations technologies and systems of sp global and ihs markit in connection with the merger the management of the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration many of which may be beyond the control of management and which may result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy as well as materially adversely impact the anticipated synergies of the merger and the business financial condition and results of operations of the combined company the integration process and other disruptions resulting from the merger may also adversely affect the combined company’s relationships with employees suppliers customers distributors and others with whom sp global and ihs markit have business or other dealings and difficulties in integrating the businesses of sp global and ihs markit could harm the reputation of the combined company 

these incremental transactionrelated costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs factors beyond the parties’ control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses many of which by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately some of these expenses have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the merger is completed 

if the merger is completed our shareholders’ ownership percentage will be diluted 

if the merger is completed we will issue to ihs markit shareholders shares of our common stock as a result of the issuance of these shares of our common stock our shareholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company after the merger and will therefore have a reduced voting interest 

during the pendency of the merger our ability to execute share repurchases will be restricted 

while the merger is pending we will have limited opportunities to launch repurchase programs and there can no guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute a repurchase program when a window of opportunity presents itself 

covid19 risks 

the covid19 pandemic and its effects have affected and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

following the outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus “covid19” the world health organization declared a global emergency on january 30 2020 and subsequently declared covid19 as a pandemic on march 11 2020 

covid19 has spread globally including in the united states the united kingdom the european union and other jurisdictions in which we operate governments across the world have taken steps to contain the virus by restricting human movement through numerous measures including travel bans and restrictions social distancing quarantines shelter in place orders enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere and business shutdowns continuation of the shutdown of businesses and entire industries increases in unemployment implementation of furloughs lost wages across populations and a significant drop in consumer and business spending resulted in a recession in the united states during 2020 while vaccines have become available their availability and distribution is at the discretion of government agencies and it is difficult to ascertain how and when they will impact economic activity there are no comparable recent events that can provide guidance as to the effect of the covid19 global pandemic and as a result the ultimate impact of the coronavirus outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain the effects of covid19 have impacted our operations and may ultimately have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future the extent to which the pandemic will continue to affect our businesses financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted 

increased volatility and uncertainty in the global economy and the financial and commodities markets 

the global economy has been disrupted as a result of the ongoing health crisis and the financial and commodities markets have reacted with unprecedented volatility governmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth the success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address the market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity even after the pandemic subsides the us economy and other major economies may continue to experience a recession and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the us and other major markets because there are no comparable recent events that can provide guidance on the impact to the global economy we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be impacted in addition the increase in revenue of ratings in 2020 was primarily driven by higher corporate bond issuance in the us mainly resulting from historically low borrowing costs increased borrowing demand from companies to increase their liquidity in light of uncertainties associated with covid19 and central bank lending actions there can be no guarantee that such favorable conditions would continue in the future and our businesses financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected absent such favorable conditions moreover the unprecedented volatility observed in the markets since the outset of covid19 may result in sudden unexpected changes in market structures that were not previously anticipated by laws rules regulations or general market practices risks posed to our businesses financial condition and results of operations from volatility in the financial and commodities markets are described in the risk factor below entitled “changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment products changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business financial condition or results of operations” 

decreased demand for our subscription services 

our clients are being impacted to varying degrees some may no longer be in business by the time the covid19 pandemic comes to an end others will face significant spending constraints in order to continue to operate and others may reduce their workforces permanently as a result of the impact on our clients our subscription services may face pricing pressure on renewals delayed renewals and challenges to new sales which would in turn reduce revenue ultimately impacting our results of operations limited human mobility has among other things significantly reduced demand for energy used in transportation and the decrease in demand has been exacerbated by political tensions between large oil producing countries 

this could put additional pressure on platts clients and translate into slower demand for our subscription and related products and services moreover while our business continuity program has been effective to date the current restrictions on human mobility limit our ability to interact with subscribers and effectively demonstrate new products and may have a negative effect on our ability to secure new subscriptions and renewals 

our businesses assess and analyze the impact of economic events 

our divisions are all actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on the quickly evolving economic conditions we are publishing articles and research pieces that attempt to assess the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the world economy and its components both geographic and sectoral in addition we are taking actions including but not limited to rating actions revising the composition of our indices etc consistent with our business procedures in response to the evolving conditions notwithstanding the care we take in carrying out our work the views and assumptions we express the conclusions we draw the actions we take and the work our divisions are producing today are likely to be heavily scrutinized with the benefit of hindsight we have faced significant regulatory and media scrutiny following prior periods of volatility and economic uncertainty such scrutiny has in the past and may in the future impact our reputation brand and credibility and result in government and regulatory proceedings investigations inquiries and litigation see the below risk factors entitled “exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations” and “our reputation credibility and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace” 

business continuity 

our business continuity program has been effective to date since midmarch 2020 nearly our entire employee population was working remotely while we have been able to continue our operations during this time maintaining a remote work environment for an extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on our productivity and our ability to meet the needs of our clients and exposes us to operational risks see the below risk factor entitled “our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability” in addition a portion of our information technology resources have been diverted to establishing and maintaining an infrastructure that supports a sustained remote working environment such efforts limit the resources available for improvement and innovation projects moreover given the extent to which we are utilizing a remote working environment we face increased vulnerability although there has not been a cyber attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company to date we have noted an increase in cyber threats targeted at our remote work environment and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future see the below risk factor entitled “we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information” in addition while our employee base currently has adequate resources to pursue new clients or expand existing relationships we have no control over the business continuity resources available to our clients as a result our ability to maintain expand or establish new client relationships may be limited 

business operational and regulatory risks 

changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic andor global capital markets asset levels and flows into investment products changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

• our business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the us and world financial markets 

• economic conditions and volatility across the globe are generally affected by negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in addition natural and manmade disasters as well as the outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases introduce volatility and uncertainty into the global capital and commodities markets and negatively impact general economic conditions volatile negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets which are increasingly interdependent because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets increased volatility or an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations 

• since a significant component of our creditrating based revenue is transactionbased and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets unfavorable financial or economic 

conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities tend to reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which ratings provides credit ratings 

• our indices business is impacted by market volatility asset levels of investment products tracking indices and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives volatile capital markets as well as changing investment styles among other factors may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an indexlinked investment product 

• increases in interest rates or credit spreads volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment significant political or economic events defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers the level of derivatives trading andor the types of creditsensitive products being offered any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• our platts business is impacted by volatility in the commodities markets weak economic conditions especially in our key markets including the energy industry could reduce demand for our products impacting our revenues and margins as a result of volatility in commodity prices and trading activity in physical commodities and commodities derivatives we may encounter difficulty in achieving sustained market acceptance of past or future contract terms which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

• any weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscriptionbased products 

• the foregoing factors generally affect our performance and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information 

• our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our thirdparty vendors 

• all of our businesses have access to material nonpublic information concerning the company’s customers including sovereigns corporate issuers and other third parties around the world the unauthorized disclosure of which could affect the trading markets for such customers’ securities and could damage such customers’ competitive positions the cyber risks the company faces range from cyber attacks common to most industries to more sophisticated and targeted attacks some of which may be carried out by statesponsored actors intended to obtain unauthorized access to certain information or systems due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers or the composition of our indices unauthorized disclosure of this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us 

• we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis although there has not been a cyber attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company to date there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future 

• breaches of our or our vendors’ systems and networks whether from circumvention of security systems denialofservice attacks or other cyber attacks hacking computer viruses or malware employee error malfeasance physical breaches or other actions may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors’ websites applications or data processing or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us our business or our customers in the ordinary course our thirdparties including our vendors are subject to various forms of cyber attacks to date such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact 

• misappropriation improper modification destruction corruption or unavailability of our data and information due to cyber incidents attacks or other security breaches could damage our brand and reputation result in litigation and regulatory actions and lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones 

• although we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems software networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers clients and employees there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security 

• measures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive and may be insufficient circumvented or become obsolete while we have not experienced a material incident to date any material incident could cause us to experience reputational harm loss of customers regulatory actions sanctions or other statutory penalties litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents 

• cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated and include denial of service attacks ransomware phishing attacks and payment fraud despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate detect avoid or mitigate such threats certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access introduce malicious software disable or degrade service or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched 

• given the extent to which our businesses are privy to material nonpublic information concerning our customers our data could be improperly used including for insider trading by our employees and third party vendors with access to key systems we have experienced insider trading incidents involving employees in the past and it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third party vendors we take precautions to detect and prevent such activity including implementing and training on insider trading policies for our employees and contractual obligations for our third party vendors but such precautions are not guaranteed to deter misconduct any breach of our clients’ confidences as a result of employee or third party vendor misconduct could harm our reputation 

• the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims 

• an actual or perceived breach of our security may harm the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our thirdparty business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business 

• any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

changes in the legislative regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect compile use and publish data and may impact our financial results 

• global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant in addition an inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations despite our best efforts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others 

• certain types of information we collect compile use and publish including offerings in all our businesses and particularly our market intelligence business are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate in addition there is increasing concern among certain privacy advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests 

• there has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection information security and consumer and personal privacy the law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy laws in the us the european union “eu” and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information of our employees vendors and customers 

• the eus comprehensive general data privacy regulation the “gdpr” became fully effective in 2018 gdpr requires companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data including its use protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves 

• failure to comply with gdpr requirements could result in penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenue gdpr and other similar laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may be costly to comply with result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

• the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” became fully effective january 1 2020 requiring among other things covered companies to provide new disclosures to california consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to optout of certain sales of personal information the ccpa provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on california residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties 

• our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability 

• we devote meaningful time and financial resources to compliance with the gdpr the ccpa and other current and future applicable international and us privacy cybersecurity and related laws we have made capital investments and other expenditures to address cybersecurity preparedness and prevent future breaches including costs associated with additional security technologies personnel experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached but there can be no assurance that we will not need to make significant additional expenditures these costs which could be material could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems 

• in addition the eu and other jurisdictions including china are considering imposing or have already imposed additional restrictions including in relation to crossborder transfers of personal data these requirements are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which could result in greater compliance risk and cost for us 

• continued privacy concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations future laws and regulations with respect to the collection compilation use and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations increased compliance or litigation expense adverse publicity or loss of revenue which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations it is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data which could affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs 

• we may also from time to time be subject to or face assertions that we are subject to additional obligations relating to personal data by contract or due to assertions that selfregulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices 

exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• in the normal course of business both in the united states and abroad we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries as discussed under item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in this annual report on form 10k and in note 13  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  in this annual report on form 10k and we face the risk that additional proceedings investigations and inquiries will arise in the future 

• many of these proceedings investigations and inquiries relate to the activity of our ratings indices and platts businesses in addition various government and selfregulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations including those related to our regulated activities and antitrust matters 

• any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• in view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments damages fines penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be as a result we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• as litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses as the case may be we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects if any on our consolidated financial condition cash flows business and competitive position which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods 

• legal proceedings impose additional expenses on the company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues 

• risks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the united states in addition new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the company in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions these litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• we may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

increasing regulation of our ratings business in the united states europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• the financial services industry is highly regulated rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the united states europe and elsewhere the businesses conducted by ratings are in certain cases regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 the “reform act” the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” the us securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” andor the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business 

• in the past several years the us congress the international organization of securities commissions iosco the sec and the european commission including through the european securities market authority esma as well as regulators in other countries in which ratings operates have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies other laws regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies 

• these laws and regulations and any future rulemaking could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs which we may be unable to pass through to customers in addition there may be uncertainty over the scope interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations we may be required to incur significant expenses in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines penalties or other sanctions legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability it is difficult to accurately assess the future impact of legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers’ businesses and they may affect ratings’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process alter the manner in which ratings’ ratings are developed affect the manner in which ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business each of these developments increases the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations profitability and competitiveness the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized

• the markets for credit ratings financial research market data indexbased products and commodities price assessments and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive ratings market intelligence platts and indices compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of their offerings client service reputation price geographic scope range of products and technological innovation 

• while our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers including exchanges we also face competition from nontraditional providers such as asset managers investment banks and technologyled companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses 

• in addition in some of the countries in which ratings competes governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers 

• sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of platts’ revenue including subscription and licensing fees 

introduction of new or enhanced products and services could impact our profitability 

• we operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs 

• in order to maintain a competitive position we must continue to invest in new offerings and enhancements including new ways to deliver our products and services 

• these new or enhanced offerings resulting from our investments may not achieve market acceptance may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically 

• we could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate 

our ability to develop adapt or implement new and improved processes and technology may adversely impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

• the rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which we operate to succeed in the future we will need to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate design develop assemble test market and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner 

• innovation and constant development in support of new products and enhancements to existing products calls for the implementation of new and improved processes and technologies that require related change management efforts while we employ a certain level of internal and external resources to mitigate the risks associated with implementing process and technology improvements we may face unexpected challenges in execution that may require more management attention than expected thus diverting management time and energy from other businesses the foregoing and other unforeseen factors could also result in business being disrupted for a period of time as well as additional commitments of financial resources 

a significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 

• our major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments 

• we offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require 

• we make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues 

• although we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability of these investments 

increased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• in recent years more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available particularly through the internet and advances in public cloud computing and open source software may continue 

• public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information can reduce demand for our products and services demand could also be reduced as a result of costcutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations although we believe our products are enhanced by our analysis tools and applications our financial results may be adversely affected if our customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services 

consolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth 

• our businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate financial services and commodities industries the consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base 

• our customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services if a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

• alternatively customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors including by selecting other vendors with lowercost offerings or by selfsourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services if customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other vendors and not us if we lose business to lower priced competitors or if customers elect to selfsource their product and service needs our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

• a material portion of our revenues in our indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchangetraded funds a loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire 

• our ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers including certain data software and service suppliers some of our products and their related value are dependent upon updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon continuing access to historical and current data 

• we utilize certain data provided by thirdparty data sources in a variety of ways including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world 

• if the data from our suppliers has errors is delayed has design defects is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• some of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from or restricted use of or litigation in connection with a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use and offer our clients and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position 

• we consider many of our products and services to be proprietary failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm the value of and revenue generated by such assets as well as our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively businesses we acquire may also have intellectual property portfolios which increase the complexity of managing our intellectual property portfolio and protecting our competitive position 

• our products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and 

misappropriation our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets for example we do business in a number of countries included on the priority watch list maintained by the office of the united states trade representative and which are currently thought to afford less protection to intellectual property rights generally than some other jurisdictions the lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in such jurisdictions referenced above may significantly increase our vulnerability as regards unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position 

• our products also contain intellectual property of third party sources any violation by us of the intellectual property rights of such third parties could result in termination of the relevant source agreement litigation and reputational damage which could materially and adversely affects our business financial condition or results of operations 

future legislation regulatory reform or policy changes especially abrupt changes could have a material effect on our business and results of operations 

• future legislation regulatory reform or policy changes such as financial services regulatory reform us oil regulation governmentsponsored enterprise reform and increased infrastructure spending and significant changes in trade policy including sanctions could impact our business changes in legislation regulation or policy increase the likelihood that we will fail to appropriately adapt to changes in our compliance obligations particularly when such changes happen abruptly such as following a change in government any of the forgoing changes could impact our results of operations and cash flows directly such changes may also impact our business by creating increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial and commodities markets at this time we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows 

regulatory changes and economic conditions leading up to and following the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

• voters in the united kingdom uk approved an exit from the eu via a referendum in 2016 and in 2017 the uk invoked article 50 of the treaty on the eu commencing the process to leave the eu “brexit” and on january 31 2020 the uk formally exited the eu the eu and the uk concluded the euuk trade and cooperation agreement on december 24 2020 which took effect provisionally on january 1 2021 following the end of the formal transition period 

• brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the uk and the eu as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate and the eu determines how to treat regulated activities eg the activities of credit rating agencies originating in the uk our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in europe potential changes in eu regulation divergent interpretations by the uk of any replicated eu laws andor additional regulation in the uk could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses in particular our ratings business for the first time is subject to regulation by the financial conduct authority effective january 1 2021 

• changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit could adversely affect our ability to retain talent for our european operations 

• any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate could adversely affect our business business opportunities results of operations financial condition and cash flows the lack of certainty creates the risk that notwithstanding that we have devoted valuable resources to a thorough preparation for the impact of brexit on our european operations we may not be adequately prepared for an unforeseen outcome 

our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm or legal liability 

• in addition to the covid risks outlined above should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem such as an earthquake hurricane flood terrorist attack another outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases security breach cyber attack power loss telecommunications failure or other natural or manmade disaster our ability to continue to operate will depend in part on the availability of our personnel our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer telecommunication and other related systems and operations in such an event we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

• we regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession however a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could 

materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss loss of human capital regulatory actions reputational harm damaged client relationships or legal liability 

outsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs 

• we have outsourced certain functions to thirdparty service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the thirdparty service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements may not produce reliable results may not perform in a timely manner may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information or may fail to perform at all failure of these third parties to meet their contractual regulatory confidentiality or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss higher costs regulatory actions and reputational harm 

• outsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the thirdparty service providers may not maintain adequate physical technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data regulatory penalties and remedial costs 

• we also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with whom we do business and to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality including thirdparty cloud infrastructure our cloud infrastructure providers or other service providers could experience system breakdowns or failures outages downtime cyber attacks adverse changes to financial condition bankruptcy or other adverse conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation thus our plans to increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to “the cloud” or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure 

we rely heavily on network systems and the internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers 

• many of our products and services are delivered electronically and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computerbased networks our customers also depend on the continued capacity reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems our websites and the internet 

• our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures malicious or defective software human error natural disasters service outages at thirdparty internet providers or increased government regulation 

• delays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers in addition a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers 

• although we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers our systems are not always fully redundant and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective as such these disruptions may affect our ability to store handle and secure such data and information 

our operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• our ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located including new york city the location of our headquarters and major cities worldwide in which we have offices 

• this may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business whether due to human error natural disasters power loss telecommunication failures breakins sabotage intentional acts of vandalism acts of terrorism political unrest war or otherwise our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful 

• we rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases systems and applications to support key product and service offerings we believe we have appropriate policies processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems 

• we also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and lowrisk systems and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of nonessential services if a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other 

systems or communicate with or travel to other locations such persons’ ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer 

• we cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure or the failure of a third party to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions a disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

inability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

• the development maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge experience and ability of our highly skilled educated and trained employees accordingly our business is dependent on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees if the company is less successful in its recruiting efforts or if it is unable to retain key employees its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected 

our reputation credibility and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 

• our reputation credibility and the strength of our brand are key competitive strengths 

• given our role in the financial and commodities markets our ability to attract and retain customers is uniquely affected by external perceptions of our reputation credibility and brand 

• negative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers prospects regulators and the public generally which could negatively impact among other things our ability to attract and retain customers employees and suppliers as well as suitable candidates for acquisition or other combinations 

• damage to our reputation credibility and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful 

• we believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our business into major geographic and product markets including china and esg respectively and we are in the process of such expansion efforts expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets and if we do not we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets which could adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations 

• the geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal economic operational market compliance and reputational risks these include among others risks relating to 

▪ economic and political conditions around the world 

▪ inflation 

▪ fluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates 

▪ limitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our nonus subsidiaries 

▪ differing accounting principles and standards 

▪ increases in taxes or changes in us or foreign tax laws including the possible increase in the us corporate income tax rate and other changes in tax policy proposed by the biden administration 

▪ potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations including tax systems administered by foreign government agencies some of which may conflict with us or other sources of law 

▪ changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements 

▪ the possibility of nationalization expropriation price controls and other restrictive governmental actions 

▪ competition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity longer operating histories andor support from local governments or other institutions and 

▪ civil unrest protests terrorism unstable governments and legal systems and other factors 

adverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

• additionally we are subject to complex us european and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad including trade sanctions laws anticorruption and antibribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 antimoney laundering laws and other financial crimes laws our internal controls policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs related to these topics may not be effective in preventing employees contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations a determination that we have violated such laws could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition or results of operations 

• compliance with international and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation our ability to attract and retain employees our business financial condition or results of operations 

• embargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to russia iran and venezuela these embargoes and sanctions laws may affect our ability to continue to market andor sell our products and services into these geographies in addition while we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of import and export laws and sanctions violations of these laws or sanctions could have an adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations

 includes industrials and financial services 

• corporate issuance was up in 2020 driven by increases in both highyield and investment grade issuance in the us and europe us highyield issuance was particularly strong as issuers were taking advantage of historically low borrowing costs issuance was also aided by central bank lending actions intended to provide market stabilization a number of large financing transactions contributed to the increase in investmentgrade issuance in the us and europe in 2020 



 represents no activity in 2020 and 2019 

• abs issuance in the us decreased in 2020 driven by lower market activity due to the impact of covid19 abs issuance in europe increased in 2020 reflecting low prior year activity as issuers were trying to comply with the new eu framework for sts securitization simple transparent and standardized

legal and regulatory environment 

general

european union 

in the european union eu the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions in 2009 the european parliament passed a regulation “cra1” that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the eu which became effective in 2010 cra1 requires the registration formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the eu ratings was granted registration in october of 2011 in january of 2011 the eu established the european securities and markets authority “esma” which among other things has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the eu 

additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013 commonly referred to as cra3 these rules among other things 

• impose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers 

• require member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations 

• impose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer 

• impose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed and 

• impose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services 

the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the eu 

other jurisdictions

legal and regulatory environment 

over the past four years the financial benchmarks industry has been subject to specific benchmark regulation in the european union the eu benchmark regulation and australia the australia benchmark regulation other jurisdictions are also considering new regulation for financial benchmarks 

the eu benchmark regulation was published june 30 2016 and included provisions applicable to indices and platts both indices and platts have established separate benchmark administrators in connection with their benchmark activities in europe the indices and platts entities are both based in amsterdam and are authorized by the dutch authority for financial markets afm this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear 

the australian benchmark regulation was enacted in june of 2018 and included provisions applicable to indices designating the sp asx 200 a significant financial benchmark and therefore requiring indices as the administrator of the sp asx 200 to obtain a license from the australian securities and investment commission “asic” indices has obtained the relevant license although narrower in scope the requirements of the australian benchmark regulation are similar to those of the eu benchmark regulation this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear 

in july of 2013 the iosco issued financial benchmark principles iosco principles intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmark determinations the iosco principles address governance benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms including with regard to the indices published by indices even though the iosco principles are not binding law indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the iosco principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of such alignment

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2021 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2020 over the next several years additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table 



1 our debt obligations are described in note 5 – debt to our consolidated financial statement 

2 see note 13 – commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our operating lease obligations  

3 other consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing and certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance 

as of december 31 2020 we had 121 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because until formal resolutions are reached reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2020 we have recorded 2781 million for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 9 – equity to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cme group index services llc cgis has the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy 

at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2020 we contributed 12 million to our retirement plans expected employer contributions in 2021 are 11 million and 4 million for our retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2021 we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 7 – employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow additionally we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow which are included in the table below 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock 

the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below

critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we adopted financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective transition method applied to our revenue contracts with customers as of january 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under asc 606 while prior year amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under asc 605 revenue recognition we recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of 35 million as of january 1 2018 due to the cumulative effect of adopting asc 606 with the impact primarily related to our treatment of costs to obtain a contract and to a lesser extent changes to the timing of the recognition of our subscription and nontransaction revenues 

under asc 606 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services under asc 605 revenue was recognized as it was earned and when services were rendered see note 1  accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 16 million 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we incorporated the forecasted impact of future economic conditions into our allowance for doubtful accounts measurement process including the expected adverse impact of covid19 on the global economy based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2021 

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 46 billion and 44 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a quantitative impairment test if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge for 2020 based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

• discount rate assumptions are based on current yields on highgrade corporate longterm bonds 

• healthcare cost trend assumptions are based on historical market data the nearterm outlook and an assessment of likely longterm trends 

• the expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the longterm 

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

in 2018 we made a onetime issuance of incentive stock options under the 2002 plan to replace kensho employees stock options that were assumed in connection with our acquisition of kensho in april of 2018 there were no stock options granted in 2020 and 2019 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2021 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits 

as of december 31 2020 we have approximately 31 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of which 08 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available the more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture include an estimated discount rate a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows eg the revenue growth rates and operating margins and a company specific beta the significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models are forwardlooking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions 

recent accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet these forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we entered into crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes see note 6 – derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further discussion

the australian benchmark regulation was enacted in june of 2018 and included provisions applicable to indices designating the sp asx 200 a significant financial benchmark and therefore requiring indices to obtain a license from the australian investment and securities commission “asic” as its administrator indices is in the process of obtaining such license although narrower in scope the requirements of the australian benchmark regulation are similar to those of the eu benchmark regulation this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear

see note 9 — equity to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further discussion related to our asr agreements 

additional financing 

we have the ability to borrow a total of 12 billion through our commercial paper program which is supported by our revolving 12 billion fiveyear credit agreement our credit facility that we entered into on june 30 2017 this credit facility will terminate on june 30 2022 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2019 and 2018  

depending on our corporate credit rating we pay a commitment fee of 8 to 175 basis points for our credit facility whether or not amounts have been borrowed we currently pay a commitment fee of 10 basis points the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is at our option calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london interbank offer rate the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate for certain borrowings under this credit facility there is also a spread based on our corporate credit rating 

our credit facility contains certain covenants the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility is not greater than 4 to 1  and this covenant level has never been exceeded 

on november 1 2019 fitch ratings upgraded our shorttermcommercial paper rating to f1 from f2 affirmed our longterm debt rating and the ratings outlook was maintained at stable 

dividends 

on january 29 2020 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from 057 per share to 067 per share 

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2020  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2019  over the next several years additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table 



 

as of december 31 2019  we had 124 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because until formal resolutions are reached reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2019  we have recorded 2268 million for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 9 – equity to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cme group index services llc cgis has the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2019  we contributed 46 million to our retirement plans expected employer contributions in 2020 are 11 million and 5 million for our retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2020  we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 7 – employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019 and 2018  we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow additionally we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow which are included in the table below 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock 

the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below

critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we adopted financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective transition method applied to our revenue contracts with customers as of january 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under asc 606 while prior year amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under asc 605 revenue recognition we recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of 35 million as of january 1 2018 due to the cumulative effect of adopting asc 606 with the impact primarily related to our treatment of costs to obtain a contract and to a lesser extent changes to the timing of the recognition of our subscription and nontransaction revenues we recognized incremental revenue of 6 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as a result of the adoption of this standard 

under asc 606 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services under asc 605 revenue was recognized as it was earned and when services were rendered see note 1  accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 16 million 

for the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017  there were no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2020  

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2019 and 2018  the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 44 billion  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test for 2019  based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

 

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

in 2018 we made a onetime issuance of incentive stock options under the 2002 plan to replace kensho employees stock options that were assumed in connection with our acquisition of kensho in april of 2018 there were no stock options granted in 2019 and 2017 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2020 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits 

as of december 31 2019 we have approximately 32 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of which 776 million is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available the more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture include an estimated discount rate a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows eg the revenue growth rates and operating margins and a company specific beta the significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models are forwardlooking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions 

recent accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we expect the adoption of these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet however we do not expect that these standards will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities during the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet these forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting during the years ended december 31 2019  2018 and 2017 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2019 we entered into a crosscurrency swap contract to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes see note 6 – derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further discussion

revenue increased 5  due to continued demand for market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors led by petroleum partially offset by a decrease in sales usagebased royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to a decline in oil trading volumes in the first nine months of 2018 demand for market data and price assessment products was driven by international customers while petroleum is still the biggest revenue driver the proportional revenue mix continues to become more diversified as other sectors contributed to revenue growth including petrochemicals metals and agriculture international revenue increased and domestic revenue remained relatively

in october of 2012 iosco issued its principles for oil price reporting agencies pra principles which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members platts has aligned its operations with the pra principles and as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles has aligned to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks

indices 

indices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets

note  in 2018 trucost was integrated from indices into market intelligence and historical reporting was retroactively revised to reflect the change 

revenue increased 15  primarily driven by higher average levels of assets under management aum for etfs and mutual funds and higher exchangetraded derivative volumes due to market volatility average aum for etfs increased 20 to 1399 trillion compared to 2017 ending aum for etfs decreased 3 to 1309 trillion compared to 2017 driven by the impact of market depreciation in the fourth quarter of 2018 

operating profit grew 18  the impact of revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at indices and higher compensation costs from additional headcount 

revenue increased 14  primarily driven by higher aum for etfs and mutual funds ending aum for etfs increased 31 to 1343 trillion and average aum for etfs increased 34 to 1167 trillion compared to 2016 

operating profit grew 16  the impact of revenue growth was partially offset by higher compensation costs and increased operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at indices higher compensation costs related to increased incentive costs and additional headcount 

industry highlights and outlook 

indices continues to be the leading index provider for the etf market space in 2018 higher average levels of aum for etfs and higher volumes for exchangetraded derivatives contributed to revenue growth in 2018 indices continued to launch innovative indices expand index product offerings and grow international partnerships in 2019 indices will continue to focus on growing the core business expanding innovative offerings and growing globally through collaborative client relationships 

legal and regulatory environment 

the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new benchmark regulation in the european union the eu benchmark regulation the new benchmark regulation in australia the australia benchmark regulation and potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions 

the eu benchmark regulation was published june 30 2016 and included provisions applicable to indices and platts which became effective january 1 2018 the eu benchmark regulation provides a two 2 year transitional period during which indices and platts are required to obtain registration or authorization in connection with their respective benchmark activities in europe this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear 

as discussed above under the heading “platts legal and regulatory environment” the eu has finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii the introduction of the mifid ii package may result in changes to the manner in which sp dow jones indices licenses its indices mifid ii and the mar may impose additional regulatory burdens on indices activities in the eu although the exact impact and costs are not yet known 

the australian benchmark regulation was enacted in june of 2018 and included provisions applicable to indices designating the sp asx 200 a significant financial benchmark and therefore requiring indices to obtain a license from the australian investment and securities commission “asic” as its administrator although narrower in scope the requirements of the australian benchmark regulation are similar to those of the eu benchmark regulation this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear 

in july of 2013 the iosco issued financial benchmark principles intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations and address governance benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms including with regard to the indices published by indices even though the financial benchmark principles are not binding law indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the financial benchmark principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment

liquidity and capital resources 

we continue to maintain a strong financial position our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators in 2019 cash on hand cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future we use our cash for a variety of needs including but not limited to ongoing investments in our businesses strategic acquisitions share repurchases dividends repayment of debt capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure 

cash flow overview 

cash cash equivalents and restricted cash were 20 billion  as of december 31 2018  a decrease of 08 billion  as compared to december 31 2017  and consisted of approximately 40 of domestic cash and 60 of cash held abroad 



in 2018  free cash flow remained relatively unchanged at 18 billion  compared to 2017  free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects see “reconciliation of nongaap financial information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased  to  21 billion  in 2018 as compared to 20 billion  in 2017 the increase is mainly due to higher results from operations in 2018 and lower estimated income tax payments in 2018 due to the reduction of the us federal corporate tax rate as a result of the enactment of the tcja partially offset by legal settlement payments and settlement payments following the resolution of tax audits 

cash provided by operating activities increased to 20 billion in 2017 as compared to 16 billion in 2016   the increase is mainly due to higher results from operations partially offset by the timing of estimated tax payments 

  

investing activities 

our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions 

cash used for investing activities increased to  05 billion  for 2018 as compared to  02 billion  in 2017 primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of kensho and the purchase of intellectual property in 2018 

cash used for investing activities decreased to 02 billion for 2017 as compared to cash provided by investing activities of 12 billion in 2016 the decrease is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of jd power of 11 billion in 2016 

refer to note 2 – acquisitions and divestitures to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further information 

financing activities 

our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases dividends and repayment of shortterm and longterm debt while cash inflows are primarily inflows from longterm and shortterm debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

cash used for financing activities increased to  23 billion  in 2018 from 15 billion  in 2017 the increase is primarily attributable to higher cash paid for share repurchases in 2018 

cash used for financing activities decreased to 15 billion in 2017 from 17 billion in 2016 the decrease is primarily attributable to higher repayments of debt and higher cash paid for share repurchases in 2016 partially offset by the issuance of senior notes in 2016 

during 2018 we used cash to repurchase 84 million shares for 17 billion  we entered into an accelerated share repurchase asr agreement with a financial institution on october 29 2018 to initiate share repurchases aggregating 500 million we repurchased a total of 29 million shares under the asr agreement for an average purchase price of 17380 per share we entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution on march 6 2018 to initiate share repurchases aggregating 1 billion we repurchased a total of 51 million shares under that asr agreement for an average purchase price of 19749 per share

we entered into an asr agreement with a financial institution on february 11 2019 to initiate share repurchases aggregating 500 million 

see note 9 — equity  to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further discussion related to our asr agreements 

additional financing 

we have the ability to borrow a total of 12 billion  through our commercial paper program which is supported by our revolving 12 billion fiveyear credit agreement our credit facility that we entered into on june 30 2017 this credit facility will terminate on june 30 2022 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2018  and 2017

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2019  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2018  over the next several years additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table   



 

as of december 31 2018  we had 147 million  of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because until formal resolutions are reached reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2018  we have recorded 1620 million  for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 9 – equity  to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cme group index services llc cgis has the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2018  we contributed 9 million  and 1 million  to our retirement and postretirement plans respectively expected employer contributions in 2019  are 46 million  and 6 million  for our retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2019  we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 7 – employee benefits  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow additionally we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow which are included in the table below 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock 

the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below

critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

we adopted financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective transition method applied to our revenue contracts with customers as of january 1 2018 results for reporting periods beginning after january 1 2018 are presented under asc 606 while prior year amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting under asc 605 revenue recognition we recorded a net increase to opening retained earnings of 35 million  as of january 1 2018 due to the cumulative effect of adopting asc 606 with the impact primarily related to our treatment of costs to obtain a contract and to a lesser extent changes to the timing of the recognition of our subscription and nontransaction revenues we recognized incremental revenue of 6 million for the year ended december 31 2018  as a result of the adoption of this standard 

under asc 606 revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services under asc 605 revenue was recognized as it was earned and when services were rendered see note 1  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 15 million 

for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  there were no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2019  

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

for the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 24 million related to a technology project at our market intelligence segment in selling and general expenses in our consolidated statement of income 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2018  and 2017  the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 44 billion  and 37 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test for 2018  based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

in 2018 we made a onetime issuance of incentive stock options in connection with our acquisition of kensho in april of 2018 there were no stock options granted in 2017 and 2016 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2019 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits 

as of december 31 2018 we have approximately 23 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries of which 784 million is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows longterm growth rates the timing and nature of tax attributes and the redemption features 

recent   accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we expect the adoption of these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet however we do not expect that these standards will have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities during the years ended december 31 2018  and 2017 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet these forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting during the years ended december 31 2018  2017 and 2016 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes see note 6 – derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements and supplementary data in the annual report on form 10k for further discussion

revenue increased 7  driven by increases at ratings and indices partially offset by a decrease at market and commodities intelligence the increase at ratings was primarily due to growth in bank loan ratings revenue and corporate bond ratings revenue revenue growth at indices was primarily due to higher levels of assets under management for exchange traded funds etfs and mutual funds the decrease at market and commodities intelligence was primarily due to the disposition of noncore businesses in 2016 partially offset by annualized contract value growth in the sp global market intelligence desktop and global risk services products and continued demand for platts’ proprietary content at sp global platts 

operating profit decreased 23  excluding the unfavorable impact of the gain on dispositions in 2016 of 37 percentage points higher net legal settlement expenses in 2017 of 2 percentage points higher employee severance charges in 2017 of 1 percentage point a charge to exit leased facilities of 1 percentage point and noncash acquisition and dispositionrelated adjustments in 2017 of 1 percentage point partially offset by the favorable impact of higher dispositionrelated costs in 2016 of 1 percentage point operating profit increased 18 this increase was primarily due to revenue growth at ratings and indices as discussed above partially offset by higher compensation costs due to increased incentive costs and additional headcount 

revenue increased 7  driven by increases at all of our reportable segments revenue growth at market and commodities intelligence was favorably impacted by the acquisition of snl in september of 2015 and annualized contract value growth primarily driven by the sp capital iq desktop global risk services and certain data feed products within data management solutions continued demand for sp global platts’ proprietary content also contributed to revenue growth these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact from our dispositions in 2016 revenue growth at ratings was driven by an increase in us bank loan ratings revenue corporate bond ratings revenue and surveillance fees revenue growth at indices was due to higher average levels of assets under management for etfs and mutual funds an increase in data revenue and higher volumes for exchangetraded derivatives 

operating profit increased 76  excluding the favorable impact of the gain from our dispositions of 59 percentage points higher net legal settlement insurance recoveries in 2016 of 3 percentage points higher employee severance charges in 2015 of 3 percentage points and higher acquisitionrelated costs in 2015 of 2 percentage points partially offset by the unfavorable impact of higher dispositionrelated costs of 3 percentage points higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of 2 percentage points and a technologyrelated impairment charge of 1 percentage point operating profit increased 15 this increase was primarily driven by revenue growth as discussed above decreased costs at ratings and our legacy capital iq business due to reduced headcount following our 2015 restructuring actions also contributed to operating profit growth

interest expense net 

net interest expense for 2017  decreased 32 million  or 18  as compared to 2016  primarily as a result of the favorable impact of lower interest rates on the 500 million of senior notes issued in 2016 compared to the 400 million senior notes that were repaid in the third quarter of 2016

provision for income taxes 

comprehensive tax legislation enacted through the tax cuts and jobs act “tcja” on december 22 2017 significantly modified us corporate income tax law provisional amounts have been recorded in our financial statements based on the company’s initial analysis of the tcja the company may adjust these amounts in future periods if our interpretation of the tcja changes or as additional guidance from the us treasury becomes available as a result of the tcja a provisional amount of 149 million has been recorded which reflects a onetime tax charge of approximately 173 million on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

and a onetime tax benefit of approximately 24 million in respect of the revaluation of net us deferred tax liabilities at the reduced corporate income tax rate while the tcja reduced net income in 2017 the company is anticipating an ongoing future benefit from the lower corporate income tax rate 

our effective tax rate was 334  for 2017  and 301  for 2016  and 2015  the increase in 2017 was primarily due to the onetime tax charge for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings net of the recognition of excess tax benefits associated with sharebased payments in the statement of income and the revaluation of net us deferred tax liabilities at the reduced corporate income tax rate 

the company is continuously subject to tax examinations in various jurisdictions in may 2017 the irs issued a 30day letter proposing to increase the company’s federal income tax for the 2015 tax year by approximately 242 million the proposed increase relates primarily to the irs’s proposed disallowance of claimed tax deductions for certain amounts paid in 2015 to settle lawsuits by nineteen states and the district of columbia we vigorously disagree with the proposed adjustment and have filed a formal protest with the irs to contest the matter before the irs appeals office this development does not materially change our initial assessment of the deductibility of our settlement payments

revenue increased in 2017  primarily due to an increase in bank loan ratings and corporate bond ratings revenue driven by refinancing activity from the low interest rate environment highyield and investment grade corporate issuance volumes increased as a result of more favorable market conditions primarily due to tightening credit spreads and some issuers that went to market in advance of expected interest rate increases 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

legal and regulatory environment 

general 

ratings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets in which it operates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers we have reviewed the new laws regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented or are planning to implement changes as required we do not believe that such new laws regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations other laws regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local national foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies the impact on us of the adoption of any such laws regulations or rules remains uncertain but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to ratings’ rating activities or adversely affect our ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings 

in the normal course of business both in the us and abroad ratings or the legal entities comprising ratings are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries many of these proceedings investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities in addition various government and selfregulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into ratings’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition cash flows business or competitive position 

us 

the businesses conducted by our ratings segment are in certain cases regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 the “reform act” the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dodd frank act” the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” andor the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the us

european union 

in the european union the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions in 2009 the european parliament passed a regulation “cra1” that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the european union which became effective in 2010 cra1 requires the registration formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the european union ratings was granted registration in october of 2011 in january of 2011 the european union established the european securities and markets authority “esma” which among other things has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the european union 

additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013 commonly referred to as cra3 these rules among other things 



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

 

the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the european union 

other jurisdictions 

outside of the us and the european union regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future

cash used for financing activities decreased to  15 billion  in 2017 from 17 billion  in 2016 the decrease is primarily attributable to higher repayments of debt and higher cash paid for share repurchases in 2016 partially offset by the issuance of senior notes in 2016 

cash used for financing activities was 17 billion in 2016 compared to cash provided by financing activities of 13 billion in 2015 the decrease is primarily attributable to higher proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in 2015

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2018  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2017  over the next several years additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table   



 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

as of december 31 2017  we had 212 million  of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because until formal resolutions are reached reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2017  we have recorded 1350 million  for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 9 – equity  to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cme group index services llc cgis will have the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2017  we contributed 8 million  and 25 million  to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively expected employer contributions in 2018  are 9 million  and 7 million  for our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2018  we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 7 – employee benefits  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow additionally we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow which are included in the table below 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock 

the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below

critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities unless otherwise indicated all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized as it is earned when services are rendered we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable we make our best estimate of the services’ standalone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately in such cases we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period 

for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied in 2018 we will be adopting a new accounting standard for the recognition of revenue see note 1  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the new revenue standard in 2018 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 14 million 

for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  there were no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2018  

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

for the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 24 million related to a technology project at our market and commodities segment in selling and general expenses in our consolidated statement of income 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2017  and 2016  the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 37 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test for 2017  based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

during 2015 we stopped granting stock options as part of our employees total stockbased incentive awards there were no stock options granted in 2017 and 2016 and a minimal amount of stock options granted in 2015 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2018  if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits 

for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 we had determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were permanently reinvested within those foreign operations accordingly we had not recorded deferred income taxes on these 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

indefinitely reinvested earnings as of december 31 2017 we have approximately 26 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as a result of the tcja more than 70 of these 26 billion earnings will no longer be permanently reinvested we will continue to permanently reinvest approximately 780 million of these undistributed earnings 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows longterm growth rates the timing and nature of tax attributes and the redemption features 

recent   accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities during the year ended december 31 2017  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet these forward contracts are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting during the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes see note 6 – derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements for further information

 item 9b other information 

iran threat reduction and syria human rights act disclosure 

pursuant to section 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 which amended the securities exchange act of 1934 an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports as applicable whether during the reporting period it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities transactions or dealings relating to iran or with individuals or 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

entities designated pursuant to certain executive orders disclosure is generally required even where the activities transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations 

revenue in 2017 attributable to the transactions or dealings by the company described below was approximately 545000 with net profit from such sales being a fraction of the revenues 

during 2017 one of the company’s divisions a provider of energyrelated information in over 150 countries sold information and informational materials which are generally exempt from us economic sanctions to fifteen subscribers that are owned or controlled or appear to be owned or controlled by the government of iran the “goi” including one that was also designated by the treasury department’s office of foreign assets control “ofac” pursuant to executive order 13382 for part of the first quarter of 2016 the company among other things offers customers that subscribe to its publications access to proprietary data analytics and industry information that enable commodities markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency this division provided such data related to the energy and petrochemicals markets to the subscribers referenced above generating revenue that was a de minimis portion of both the divisions and the company’s revenue seven of the subscribers are identified by ofac as goi entities and nine appear based on publicly available information to be owned or controlled by goi entities in addition as previously reported during the third quarter of 2017 this division entered into a contract to sell information and informational materials to another subscriber that is owned or controlled by the government of iran and began to provide informational materials to this subscriber under the contract but no revenues were received under this contract in 2017 we believe that these transactions were permissible under us sanctions pursuant to certain statutory and regulatory exemptions for the exportation of information and informational materials the company will continue to monitor its provision of products and services to these iranian customers so that such activity continues to be permissible under us sanctions

key results

the increase in operating profit was primarily due to the impact of 16 billion in legal and regulatory settlements in 2014 compared 

to net legal settlement expenses of 54 million in 2015 in addition 2015 includes costs related to identified operating efficiencies primarily related to restructuring of 56 million in 2015 compared to 86 million in 2014 2015 also includes acquisitionrelated costs related to the acquisition of snl of 37 million and an 11 million gain on the sale of our interest in a legacy mcgraw hill construction investment 2014 includes 4 million of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities excluding these items operating profit increased 13 this increase was driven by revenue growth at market and commodities intelligence and indices and cost containment efforts at ratings during 2015

 operating profit 

we consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate 

we internally manage our operations by reference to “segment operating profit” with economic resources allocated primarily based on segment operating profit segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before unallocated expense segment operating profit is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance segment operating profit is not however a measure of financial performance under us gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 

effective beginning with the fourth quarter of 2016 we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with changes to our organizational structure and how our chief executive officer evaluates the performance of these segments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 sp global market intelligence and sp global platts are included in a new reportable segment named market and commodities intelligence our historical segment reporting has been retroactively revised to reflect the current organizational structure

segment review 

ratings 

ratings is an independent provider of credit ratings research and analytics to investors issuers and other market participants credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments they are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer such as a corporation or state or city government to meet its financial obligations in full and on time our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue such as a corporate or municipal bond and the relative likelihood that the issue may default

market issuance volumes 

we monitor market issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within ratings market issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer issuance volumes can be reported in two ways by domicile which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located or based on marketplace which is where the bonds are sold the following tables depict changes in market issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on a composite of thomson financial harrison scott publications dealogic and rating’s internal estimates

legal and regulatory environment 

general 

ratings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the us and in other countries and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the company’s operations and the markets in which it operates additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered in addition in certain countries governments may provide financial or other support to locallybased rating agencies for example governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers we have reviewed the new laws regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented or are planning to implement changes as required we do not believe that such new laws regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations other laws regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local national foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies the impact on us of the adoption of any such laws regulations or rules remains uncertain but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to ratings’ rating activities or adversely affect our ability to compete or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings 

in the normal course of business both in the us and abroad ratings or the legal entities comprising ratings are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings investigations and inquiries many of these proceedings investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities in addition various government and selfregulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into ratings’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations any of these proceedings investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments damages fines penalties or activity restrictions which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition cash flows business or competitive position 

us 

the businesses conducted by our ratings segment are in certain cases regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 the “reform act” the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “dodd frank act” the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” andor the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the us 

sp global ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the sec as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro” the sec first began informally designating nrsros in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the sec’s net capital rule the reform act created a new sec registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as nrsros under the reform act the sec is given authority and oversight of nrsros and can censure nrsros revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases the rules implemented by the sec pursuant to the reform act the dodd frank act and the exchange act address among other things prevention or misuse of material nonpublic information conflicts of interest documentation and assessment of internal controls and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies the public portions of the current version of sp global ratings’ form nrsro are available on sp global ratings’ website 

european union 

in the european union the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a paneuropean regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions in 2009 the european parliament passed a regulation “cra1” that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the european union which became effective in 2010 cra1 requires the registration formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the european union ratings was granted registration in october of 2011 in january of 2011 the european union established the european securities and markets authority “esma” which among other things has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the european union 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

additional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013 commonly referred to as cra3 these rules among other things 

 

the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the european union

indices 

indices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets 

indices primarily derives revenue from asset linked fees based on the sp and dow jones indices and to a lesser extent generates subscription revenue and transaction revenue specifically indices generates revenue from the following sources 

 





                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

revenue at indices increased 7  primarily driven by higher average levels of assets under management aum for etfs and mutual funds an increase in data revenue and higher volumes for exchangetraded derivatives revenue growth was favorably impacted by less than one percentage point from the acquisition of trucost plc trucost in october of 2016 see note 2 — acquisitions and divestitures  for further discussion ending aum for etfs increased 25 to 1023 trillion and average aum for etfs increased 8 to 869 billion compared to 2015 higher average levels of aum for etfs contributed to revenue growth primarily driven by the flow of investment funds to the us equity markets in the second half of the year foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on revenue of less than 1 percentage point 

operating profit grew 5  revenue growth was partially offset by higher compensation costs primarily driven by additional headcount related to the acquisition of trucost plc increased incentive costs and increased operating costs to support revenue growth and business initiatives at indices foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of less than 1 percentage point 

revenue at indices increased 8 primarily driven by higher average levels of aum for etfs and mutual funds volumes for exchangetraded derivatives continued to increase for certain products which also contributed to revenue growth additionally the yearoveryear revenue increase was slightly unfavorably impacted by the refinement of our process for estimating revenue for certain products that favorably impacted 2014 which caused a onetime revenue increase in the prioryear period ending aum for etfs decreased 2 to 815 billion in 2015 from 832 billion in 2014 primarily due to the flow of investment funds to the developed international equity markets and the impact of lower equity prices the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point 

operating profit grew 13 excluding the favorable impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 1 percentage point operating profit increased 12 this increase was primarily due to revenue growth as expenses remained relatively flat as a result of cost containment measures 

industry highlights and outlook 

indices continues to be the leading index provider for the etf market space in 2016 higher average levels of aum for etfs contributed to revenue growth additionally data revenue and higher volumes for exchangetraded derivatives contributed to the increase in revenue 

in october of 2016 the segment completed the acquisition of trucost to build on its current portfolio of environmental social and governance solutions 

indices will continue to seek to expand index offerings through asset class expansion new geographies and investment strategies by remaining focused on 

 

legal and regulatory environment 

the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union the “eu benchmark regulation” as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions 

the eu benchmark regulation was published june 30 2016 and included provisions applicable to indices and platts which will become effective january 1 2018 the eu benchmark regulation requires indices and platts in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with their respective benchmark activities in europe this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time although the exact impact remains unclear 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

in addition the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii which revise and update the existing eu markets in financial instruments directive framework mifid ii applies in full in all eu member states as of january 3 2017 mifid ii includes provisions that among other things i impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for nondiscriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses ii modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives iii expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation and iv provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the eu market infrastructure regulation of 2011 although the mifid ii package is “framework” legislation meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017 it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect indices’ ability both to administer and license its indices 

in july of 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” issued financial benchmark principles intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations and address governance benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms including with regard to the indices published by indices even though the financial benchmark principles are not binding law indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the financial benchmark principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment

in 2016  free cash flow increased  to 12 billion  compared to 480 million  in 2015  the increase is primarily due to the increase in cash provided from operating activities as discussed below free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects see “reconciliation of nongaap financial information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased   13 billion  to  15 billion  in 2016 compare d to 195 million in 2015 the increase is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015 of 16 billion partially offset by higher income tax payments in 2016 

cash provided by operating activities decreased   10 billion  to  195 million  in 2015 compared to 12 billion in 2014 the decrease is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015 of 16 billion

cash provided by investing activities increased  to  12 billion  for 2016 as compared to cash used for investing activities of  25 billion  in 2015 the increase is primarily due to proceeds from the sale of jd power of 11 billion in 2016 compared to cash used for the acquisition of snl of 22 billion in 2015

we have the ability to borrow a total of 12 billion  through our commercial paper program which is supported by our revolving 12 billion fiveyear credit agreement our credit facility that we entered into on june 30 2015 this credit facility will terminate 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

on june 30 2020 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2016 commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2015 totaled 143 million with an average interest rate and term of 095 and 17 days respectively 

depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio we pay a commitment fee of 10  to 20  basis points for our credit facility whether or not amounts have been borrowed we currently pay a commitment fee of 15  basis points the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is at our option calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london interbank offered rate the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate for certain borrowings under this credit facility there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate 

our credit facility contains certain covenants the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility is not greater than 4  to 1  and this covenant level has never been exceeded 

dividends 

on january 25 2017  the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from 036  per share to 041  per share 

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2017  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2016  over the next several years that relate to our continuing operations additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table   



 

as of december 31 2016  we had 161 million  of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2016  we have recorded 1080 million  for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 9 – equity  to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cme group index services llc cgis will have the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2016  we contributed 8 million  and 6 million  to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively expected employer contributions in 2017  are 8 million  for each of our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans in 2017  we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 7 – employee benefits  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow additionally we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow which are included in the table below 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt make strategic acquisitions and investments repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs 

the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below 



critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities unless otherwise indicated all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized as it is earned when services are rendered we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable we make our best estimate of the services’ standalone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately in such cases we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of the new accounting standard of recognition of revenue will have on our consolidated financial statements see note 1  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements for further information at this point we believe the new standard will have an impact on 1 the accounting for certain longterm deferred revenue in our ratings segment which may contain a financing component 2 the timing of revenue recognized in our market and commodities intelligence segment for long term contracts with price escalations and 3 the accounting for fees for historical data in our market and commodities intelligence segment currently recognized over the term of a subscription we do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 12 million 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  there were no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2017  

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

for the year ended december 31 2016 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 24 million related to a technology project at our market and commodities segment in selling and general expenses in our consolidated statement of income 

on july 31 2014 we completed the sale of the companys aircraft to harold w mcgraw iii then chairman of the companys board of directors and former president and ceo of the company for a purchase price of 20 million  during the second quarter of 2014 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 6 million  in gain loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale see note 14 – related party transactions  to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

on june 30 2014 we completed the sale of our data center to quality technology services llc “qts” which owns operates and manages data centers net proceeds from the sale of 58 million  were received in july of 2014 the sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our east windsor new jersey location inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field the sale resulted in an expense of 3 million  recorded in gain loss on dispositions in our consolidated statement of income which is in addition to the noncash impairment charge of 36 million  we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 to adjust the value of the facilities and associated infrastructure classified as held for sale to their fair value 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2016  and 2015  the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 37 billion and 36 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test for 2016  based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

 

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

during 2015 we stopped granting stock options as part of our employees total stockbased incentive awards there were no stock options granted in 2016 and a minimal amount of stock options granted in 2015 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

prior to december 31 2017 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable on the basis of present information it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within those foreign operations accordingly we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability which may be material to our future reported results financial position and cash flows 

for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes however certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows longterm growth rates the timing and nature of tax attributes and the redemption features 

recent   accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

there have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the year ended december 31 2016 our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities during the year ended december 31 2016  we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes see note 6 – derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements for further information

revenue at sp dj indices increased 8 primarily driven by higher average levels of assets under management aum for etfs and mutual funds volumes for exchangetraded derivatives continued to increase for certain products which also contributed to revenue growth additionally the yearoveryear revenue increase was slightly unfavorably impacted by the refinement of our process for estimating revenue for certain products that favorably impacted 2014 which caused a onetime revenue increase in the prioryear period ending aum for etfs decreased 2 to 815 billion in 2015 from 832 billion in 2014 primarily due to the flow of investment funds to the developed international equity markets and the impact of lower equity prices the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point 

operating profit grew 13 excluding the favorable impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 1 percentage point operating profit increased 12 this increase was primarily due to revenue growth as expenses remained relatively flat as a result of cost containment measures 

revenue at sp dj indices increased 12 primarily driven by higher average levels of aum for etfs and mutual funds higher volumes for exchangetraded derivatives also contributed to revenue growth these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower overthecounter derivative trading volumes in 2014 driven by the expiration of a licensing arrangement for commodities indices in june of 2014 aum for etfs rose 25 to 832 billion in 2014 from 668 billion in 2013 the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by less than 1 percentage point 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

operating profit grew 30 excluding the impact of professional fees largely related to corporate development activities recorded in 2014 of 2 percentage points operating profit increased 32 this increase was primarily due revenue growth and the favorable impact of a 26 million noncash impairment charge recorded in 2013 associated with an intangible asset acquired with the formation of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture and a reduction of royalty expenses the reduction of royalty expenses was the result of purchases of intellectual property rights to certain commodities indices developed by goldman sachs and broad market indices “bmi” from citigroup global markets inc as well as the expiration of a licensing arrangement for commodities indices in june of 2014 these expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in compensation costs related to additional headcount and higher incentive costs the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced operating profit by 1 percentage point 

industry highlights and outlook 

sp dj indices continues to be the leading index provider for the etf market space in 2015 higher average levels of aum for etfs contributed to revenue growth however ending aum for etfs decreased 2 to 815 billion in 2015 from 832 billion in 2014 sp dj indices will also seek to diversify their portfolio of index offerings through asset class expansion new geographies and investment strategies this group will seek to expand its fixed income offering and grow its local presence in emerging markets 

legal and regulatory environment 

the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union the “eu benchmark regulation” as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions 

the proposed eu benchmark regulation has been released for final approval and is expected to be published later this year the eu benchmark regulation will likely require sp dj indices in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark activities in europe this legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time and until the regulation is finalized the exact impact is not certain 

in addition the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii which revise and update the existing eu markets in financial instruments directive framework mifid ii will apply in full in all eu member states from january 3 2017 mifid ii includes provisions that among other things i impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for nondiscriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses ii modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives iii expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation and iv provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the eu market infrastructure regulation of 2011 although the mifid ii package is “framework” legislation meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017 it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect sp dj indices’ ability both to administer and license its indices 

in july of 2013 the international organization of securities commissions “iosco” issued financial benchmark principles which are intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations and address governance benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms including with regard to the indices published by sp dj indices even though the financial benchmark principles are not binding law sp dj indices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the financial benchmark principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform a reasonable assurance review of such alignment 

the markets for index providers are very competitive sp dj indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of its benchmark indices client service reputation price range of products and services including geographic coverage and technological innovation for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our sp dj indices business see item 1a risk factors  in this annual report on form 10k

 in the fourth quarter of 2015 we began exploring strategic alternatives for jd power included in our cc segment we committed to and initiated an active program to sell jd power in its current state that we believe is probable in the next year as a result we have classified the assets and liabilities of jd power as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015 the anticipated disposal does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on operations and financial results therefore it is not classified as a discontinued operation 

on november 3 2014 we completed the sale of mcgraw hill construction which has historically been part of our cc segment to symphony technology group for 320 million in cash accordingly the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014 and all prior periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation see note 2 — acquisitions and divestitures for further discussion

revenue grew 9 driven by strength in platts proprietary content as platts revenue grew across all regions this growth was mainly due to continued demand for platts’ market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors led by petroleum while petroleum is still the biggest driver the revenue mix continues to become more diversified as other sectors showed positive annualized contract value growth including natural gas petrochemicals metals and agriculture additionally growth has been driven by the continued licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to various commodity exchanges platts revenue for 2015 was also favorably impacted by the acquisitions of eclipse energy group as and its operating subsidiaries “eclipse” in july of 2014 and petromedia ltd and its operating subsidiaries “petromedia” in july of 2015 jd power also contributed to the revenue increase driven by an increase in auto consulting engagements in the us growth in the us power information network® pin business and the acquisition of national automobile dealers associations used car guide ucg in july of 2015 the acquisitions of eclipse petromedia and ucg had a favorable impact on revenue of 3 percentage points see note 2 — acquisitions and divestitures  for further discussion the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 1 percentage point

industry highlights and outlook 

cc expects to continue to invest in digital capabilities that will enable our brands to become more integrated in our customers workflows compete more effectively in the marketplace and create a foundation for the development of new products and revenue streams the segment expects to further expand its presence in selected markets and geographies to help drive growth 

high growth in supply and an uncertain pace of demand growth causes volatility in energy prices which will drive market participant demand for platts proprietary content including news price assessments and analytics however if commodity prices remain at levels that are lower than in recent years this is likely to have an adverse impact on the rate of growth for subscription and conference revenue in some of platts’ customer segments the international energy agency iea in its first monthly forecast of 2016 predicted that world oil consumption will rise to 957 million barrels per day in 2016 a gain of 12 million barrels per day compared to 2015 the iea expected nonopec total liquids supply to contract by nearly 600000 barrels per day in 2016 following growth of 14 million barrels per day in 2015 in 2016 platts will continue to invest in technology and customer engagement activities to seek to drive additional revenue growth across all commodity sectors they will also seek to continue to leverage the capabilities and content from recent acquisitions and expand into adjacent markets similar to 2015 they expect to continue to introduce a number of new products and price assessments within all commodity sectors platts completed its first annual assurance review confirming adherence to the iosco principles for oil price reporting agencies pras for its oil benchmarks in 2013 and as of december 2015 had completed its fourth assurance review confirming its alignment with the pra principles for both its oil and nonoil commodity benchmarks on september 17 2015 iosco announced that the pras have made the iosco pra principles an integral part of their price assessment practices and that iosco saw no need to continue its annual review of the principles’ implementation platts remains committed to ensuring its price assessment processes continue 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

to fully align with the pra principles across all commodities and will continue to retain an independent accountancy firm to conduct voluntary reasonable assurance reviews of its alignment to the pra principles 

demand for our automotive studies is driven by the performance of the automotive industry in 2015 global and us light vehicle sales increased approximately 1 and 6 respectively compared to 2014 with growth across most primary markets partially offset by decreases from russia brazil and japan for 2016 jd power projects growth for global and us light vehicles sales of 4 and 2 respectively in 2016 jd power will strive to grow the core business by strengthening their benchmark studies leveraging new initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and enhance customer delivery and increasing the distribution of their syndicated studies international growth will continue to be a key focus in 2016 as they will look to extend product offerings to increase penetration in the asiapacific region and exploring growth opportunities in target growth markets china brazil and mexico 

legal and regulatory environment 

platts’ commodities price assessment and information business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny in the us and abroad as discussed above under the heading “sp dj indiceslegal and regulatory environment” the financial benchmarks industry is subject to the new pending benchmark regulation in the european union the “eu benchmark regulation” as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions as a result of these measures as well as measures that could be taken in other jurisdictions outside of europe platts will likely be required in due course to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark and price assessment activities in europe and potentially elsewhere 

also as discussed above under the heading “sp dj indiceslegal and regulatory environment” the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii which may also impact platts’ business although the mifid ii package is “framework” legislation it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect platts’ ability both to administer and license its price assessments 

in october of 2012 iosco issued its pra principles which set out principles which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members platts has taken steps to align its operations with the pra principles and as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles has aligned to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks 

the markets for commodities price assessments and information are very competitive platts competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of its assessments and other information it provides to the commodities and related markets client service reputation price range of products and services including geographic coverage and technological innovation furthermore sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse impact on the rate of growth of platts’ revenue for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our platts business see item 1a risk factors  in this annual report on form 10k 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continue to maintain a strong financial position our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators in 2016 cash on hand cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future we use our cash for a variety of needs including among others ongoing investments in our businesses strategic acquisitions share repurchases dividends repayment of debt capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure 

cash flow overview 

cash and cash equivalents were 15 billion  as of december 31 2015  a decrease of 10 billion  as compared to december 31 2014  and consisted of approximately 10 of domestic cash and 90 of cash held abroad typically cash held outside the us is anticipated to be utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside of the us as a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years is expected to be abroad in the event funds from international operations are needed to fund operations in the us we would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the us to repatriate these funds 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  



in 2015 free cash flow decreased to 480 million  compared to 10 billion  in 2014 the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in cash provided from operating activities as discussed below free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects see “mda – reconciliation of nongaap financial information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased  10 billion  to  195 million  in 2015 the decrease is mainly due to the payment of legal and regulatory settlements in 2015 of 16 billion 

cash provided by operating activities increased  427 million  to  12 billion  in 2014 the increase is mainly due to a tax refund received in the first quarter of 2014 related to an overpayment in 2013 and the timing of our estimated tax payment which was made in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 additionally improved collections in 2014 impacting accounts receivable also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by higher incentive payments in 2014 compared to 2013 

  

investing activities 

our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions 

cash used for investing activities increased to  25 billion  for 2015 from  65 million  in 2014 primarily due to the acquisition of snl in september of 2015 

cash used for investing activities decreased to  65 million  for 2014 from 130 million  in 2013 this was primarily due to higher proceeds from dispositions in 2014 related to the sale of our data center to qts and proceeds from the sale of the companys aircraft additionally lower capital expenditures in 2014 compared to 2013 contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by a higher amount of cash paid for acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013 

refer to note 2 – acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

financing activities 

our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases dividends and repayment of debt while cash inflows are primarily inflows from longterm and shortterm debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

cash provided by financing activities was  15 billion  in 2015 compared to cash used for financing activities of 462 million  in 2014 driven by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2015 partially offset by an increase in cash used for the repurchase of treasury shares 

cash used for financing activities decreased  13 billion  to  462 million  in 2014 this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases and the repayment of shortterm debt that occurred in the first quarter of 2013 

during 2015 we used cash to repurchase 98 million shares for 974 million at an average price paid per share of 9898 excluding commissions an additional 03 million shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2015 for approximately 26 million which settled in january of 2016 including these additional shares we utilized cash to repurchase shares at an average price of 9900 excluding commissions

mcgraw the shares were purchased at a discount of 035 from the june 24 2014 new york stock exchange closing price pursuant to a private transaction with mr mcgraw we repurchased these shares with cash for 41 million at an average price of 8266 per share this transaction was approved by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the companys board of directors after consultation with members of the financial policy committee

on december 4 2013 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares the “2013 repurchase program” which was approximately 18 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time the 2013 repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions depending on market conditions as of december 31 2015  355 million  shares remained available under the 2013 repurchase program 

discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations reflects the classification of mcgraw hill construction and mhe as discontinued operations 

cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations of 129 million  in 2015 relates to the tax payment on the gain on sale of mcgraw hill construction cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations of 18 million  in 2014 relates to mcgraw hill construction and cash used for operating activities of 231 million  in 2013 relates both to mhe and mcgraw hill construction 

cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations decreased to 320 million  in 2014 compared to 21 billion  in 2013 due to lower proceeds received from the sale of mcgraw hill construction compared to the proceeds received from mhe 

cash used for financing activities decreased 25 million  in 2014 as there was no impact related to mcgraw hill construction 

additional financing 

we have the ability to borrow a total of 12 billion  through our commercial paper program which is supported by our credit facility described below commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2015 totaled 143 million  with an average interest rate and term of 095  and 17 days  as of december 31 2015 we can borrow approximately 11 billion in additional funds through the commercial paper program there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding under our credit facility as of december 31 2014 

on june 30 2015 we entered into a revolving 12 billion   fiveyear  credit agreement our credit facility that will terminate on june 30 2020  this credit facility replaced our 10 billion   fouryear  credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on june 19 2017  the previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective there were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced 

we pay a commitment fee of 10  to 20  basis points for our credit facility depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio whether or not amounts have been borrowed and currently pay a commitment fee of 15  basis points the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is at our option calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london interbank offered rate the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate for certain borrowings under this credit facility there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate 

our credit facility contains certain covenants the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility is not greater than 4  to 1  and this covenant level has never been exceeded 

on july 24 2015 in connection with the acquisition of snl we entered into a commitment letter upon receipt of the proceeds from the issuance of 20 billion of senior notes on august 18 2015 we terminated this commitment letter see note 5 —   debt  for further information

dividends

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2016  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2015  over the next several years that relate to our continuing operations additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table   



 

as of december 31 2015  we had 120 million  of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2015  we have recorded 920 million  for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 8 – equity  to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cme group index services llc cgis will have the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2015  we contributed 15 million  and 8 million  to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively expected employer contributions in 2016 are 7 million  and 9 million  for our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2016 we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 6 – employee benefits  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow additionally we have considered certain items in evaluating free cash flow which are included in the table below 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt make strategic acquisitions and investments repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs 

the presentation of free cash flow and free cash flow excluding certain items are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow excluding the impact of the items below 



critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities unless otherwise indicated all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue is recognized as it is earned when services are rendered we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable we make our best estimate of the services’ stand alone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately in such cases we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period 

for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2016 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 10 million 

for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2016 

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

on july 31 2014 we completed the sale of the companys aircraft to harold w mcgraw iii then chairman of the companys board of directors and former president and ceo of the company for a purchase price of 20 million  during the second quarter of 2014 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 6 million  within other income loss in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale see note 13 – related party transactions  to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

on june 30 2014 we completed the sale of our data center to quality technology services llc “qts” which owns operates and manages data centers net proceeds from the sale of 58 million  were received in july of 2014 the sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our east windsor new jersey location inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field the sale resulted in an expense of 3 million  recorded within other income loss in our consolidated statement of income which is in addition to the noncash impairment charge of 36 million  we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 to adjust the value facilities and associated infrastructure classified as held for sale to their fair value 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we also incurred a 26 million  noncash impairment charge associated with an intangible asset acquired through the formation of our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2015  and 2014  the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 36 billion and 21 billion respectively the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of snl in september of 2015 see note 2 – acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test for 2015  based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at our sp ratings sp capital iq and snl sp dj indices and cc operating segments and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

 52 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

 

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



 

in addition to the assumptions in the above table assumed mortality is also a key assumption in determining benefit obligations effective december 31 2014 the company updated the assumed mortality rates to reflect life expectancy improvements 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2016 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable on the basis of present information it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within those foreign operations accordingly we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability which may be material to our future reported results financial position and cash flows 

for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes however certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in sp dj indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows longterm growth rates the timing and nature of tax attributes and the redemption features 

recent   accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

there have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the year ended december 31 2015  our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities as of december 31 2015  we have entered into an immaterial amount of foreign exchange forwards to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

both domestic and international revenue increased over 2012 however international increased at a higher rate due to the continued sales growth of the sp capital iq desktop in europe and asia and the growth of quanthouse international growth was partially offset by our decision to close certain businesses and products wit hin sp capital iq markets intelligence 

the subscription base for ratingsxpress® grew due to new client relationships and expanded relationships within existing accounts as the number of customers increased 5 in 2013 as compared to 2012 ratingsxpress® benefited from increased compliance requirements which created a greater need for alternative risk tools improvements made to the speed and timeliness through delivery on the xpressfeed platform also contributed to growth in ratingsxpress® sales related to ratingsdirect® increased more toward the second half of 2013 as the product became available on the sp capital iq desktop platform and growth in contract values was driven by being able to sell bundled packages with other sp capital iq desktop data sets 

the 2012 acquisitions of quanthouse and credit market analysis limited also contributed to the increase in revenue 

operating profit 

operating profit increased as compared to 2013 due to the increase in revenue as discussed above expense savings from the closure of several noncore businesses and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 8 million partially offsetting the increases to operating profit were increased compensation costs primarily due to improved sales performance and additional headcount in developing regions and higher technology costs operating profit was also unfavorably impacted by higher restructuring charges in 2014 as compared to 2013 

operating profit increased slightly as compared to 2012 due to the increase in revenue as discussed above lower expenses resulting from the closure of several noncore businesses reductions in outside consulting fees lower restructuring costs in 2013 as compared to 2012 and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 9 million partially offsetting the increases to operating profit were higher incentive costs due to improved performance increased costs of sales for exchange fees incurred by quanthouse costs related to additional headcount in developing regions and a loss on the sale of financial communications of 3 million in 2013

revenue 

revenue at sp dj indices grew compared to 2013 primarily driven by higher average levels of assets under management aum for etfs and mutual funds higher volumes for exchangetraded derivatives also contributed to revenue growth these increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower overthecounter derivative trading volumes in 2014 driven by the expiration of a licensing arrangement for commodities indices in june of 2014 

  

45 new etfs were launched during 2014 compared to 40 launched during 2013 aum for etfs rose 25 to 832 billion in 2014 from 668 billion in 2013 aum for the fourth quarter of 2014 surpassed th e record amount set in  the third quarter o f 2014 and   sp dj indices continues to be the leading index provider for the etf market with assets representing 29 of global etf assets 

revenue at sp dj indices grew compared to 2012 primarily due to the incremental revenue from the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture excluding the incremental revenue from the joint venture revenue increased primarily due higher average levels of assets under management for etf products the trend toward etf products continued in 2013 driving a fourth consecutive quarterly record for etf assets under management in the fourth quarter of 2013 volumes for exchangetraded derivatives continued to increase primarily for certain chicago board options exchange cboe products higher rates for certain new contracts also contributed to revenue growth in 2013 

40 new etfs were launched during 2013 compared to 85 launched during 2012 assets under management for etfs rose 43 to 668 billion in 2013 from 466 billion in 2012 as the etf market becomes more mature we are beginning to evaluate those etfs that have been launched that have not been as successful and making efforts to close them down 

operating profit 

operating profit grew compared to 2013 due to the increase in revenue as discussed above the favorable impact of a 26 million noncash impairment charge recorded in 2013 associated with an intangible asset acquired with the formation of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture and a reduction of royalty expenses the reduction of royalty expenses was the result of purchases of intellectual property rights to certain commodities indices developed by goldman sachs and broad market indices “bmi” from citigroup global markets inc as well as the expiration of a licensing arrangement for commodities indices in june of 2014 these expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in compensation costs related to additional headcount and higher incentive costs 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

operating profit increased due to the increase in revenue as discussed above and from the reduction of transaction costs associated with our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture in 2012 this was partially offset by the impact of higher data fees increased incentive costs due to improved financial performance and higher marketing costs due to increased advertising levels as building the sp dj indices brand was a focus in 2013 the increase in 2013 was also partially offset by the impact of a full year of expenses for our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture additionally we incurred a 26 million noncash impairment charge associated with an intangible asset acquired through the formation of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture 

industry highlights and outlook 

sp dj indices the leading index provider for the etf market space grew in 2014 as the trend toward etfs continued driving record aum levels in 2015 we expect this favorable trend to continue driving higher aum levels over the longterm sp dj indices will also seek to diversify their portfolio of index offerings through asset class expansion new geographies and investment strategies this group will seek to expand its fixed income offering and grow its local presence in emerging markets 

legal and regulatory environment 

the financial services industry generally and the benchmark industry specifically are subject to the potential for increased regulation in the united states and abroad 

the european union has recently finalized a package of legislative measures known as mifid ii which revise and update the existing eu markets in financial instruments directive framework mifid ii will apply in full in all eu member states from january 3 2017 mifid ii includes provisions that among other things i impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for nondiscriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses ii modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives iii expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation and iv provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the eu market infrastructure regulation of 2011 although the mifid ii package is “framework” legislation meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures to be agreed upon in the period before 2017 it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect sp dj indices’ ability both to administer and license its indices 

in july 2013 iosco issued financial benchmark principles which are intended to promote the reliability of benchmark determinations and address governance benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms including with regard to the indices published by sp dj indices even though the financial benchmark principles are not binding law sp dj indices has taken steps to align its operations with the financial benchmark principles 

benchmark regulation is continuing to be considered in the european union and at the same time the united kingdom is also reviewing its domestic framework for the supervision of benchmark administrators as a result of these measures as well as measures that could be taken in other jurisdictions outside of europe sp dj indices could in due course be required to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark activities in europe and elsewhere 

the markets for index providers are very competitive sp dj indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of its benchmark indices client service reputation price geographic scope range of products and services and technological innovation

platts’ commodities price assessment and information business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny in the united states and abroad 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

in the european union for a discussion on the effects of mifid ii which may also impact platts’ business see “sp dj indiceslegal and regulatory environment” although the mifid ii package is “framework” legislation it is possible that the introduction of these laws and rules could affect platts’ ability both to administer and license its price assessments 

on october 5 2012 iosco issued its pra principles which sets out principles that iosco states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members platts has taken steps to align its operations with the pra principles and as recommended by iosco in its final report on the pra principles is in the process of completing its alignment to the pra principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks the cost of compliance with the pra principles as well as obtaining annual thirdparty reviews of its adherence to the pra principles will increase platts’ cost of doing business 

benchmark regulation is continuing to be considered in the european union and at the same time the united kingdom is also reviewing its domestic framework for the supervision of benchmark administrators as a result of these measures as well as measures that could be taken in other jurisdictions outside of europe platts could in due course be required to obtain registration or authorization in connection with its benchmark and price assessment activities in europe and elsewhere 

the markets for commodities price assessments and information are very competitive platts competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of its assessments and other information it provides to the commodities and related markets client service reputation price geographic scope range of products and services and technological innovation furthermore sustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse impact on the rate of growth of platts’ revenue

liquidity and capital resources 

we continue to maintain a strong financial position our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators in 2015 cash on hand cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future we use our cash for a variety of needs including among others ongoing investments in our businesses strategic acquisitions share repurchases dividends repayment of debt capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure 

cash flow overview 

cash and cash equivalents were 25 billion  as of december 31 2014  an increase of 955 million  as compared to december 31 2013  and consisted of approximately 60 of domestic cash and 40 of cash held abroad typically cash held outside the us is anticipated to be utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside of the us as a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years is expected to be abroad in the event funds from international operations are needed to fund operations in the us we would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the us to repatriate these funds 



in 2014 free cash flow increased to 10 billion  compared to 590 million  in 2013 the increase was primarily due to the increase in cash provided from operating activities as discussed below free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects see “mda – reconciliation of nongaap financial information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased  427 million  to  12 billion  in 2014 the increase is mainly due to a tax refund received in the first quarter of 2014 related to an overpayment in 2013 and the timing of our estimated tax payment which was made in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 additionally improved collections in 2014 impacting accounts receivable also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by higher incentive payments in 2014 compared to 2013 

cash provided by operating activities increased  52 million  to  782 million  in 2013 the increase is mainly due to higher operating results and improved cash collections in 2013 impacting accounts receivable these increases were partially offset by a tax payment made in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 our legal settlements and higher incentive compensation payments in 2013 reflecting greater achievement against targeted results in 2012 as compared to 2011 

in 2015 we intend to pay the accrued legal and regulatory settlement charges incurred in 2014 

investing activities 

our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures while cash inflows are primarily from dispositions 

cash used for investing activities decreased to  65 million  for 2014 from  130 million  in 2013 this was primarily due to higher proceeds from dispositions related to the sale of our data center to qts and proceeds from the sale of the companys aircraft additionally lower capital expenditures in 2014 compared to 2013 contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by a higher amount of cash paid for acquisitions in 2014 compared to 2013 

cash used for investing activities decreased  116 million  to  130 million  for 2013 primarily due to a lower amount of cash paid for acquisitions and higher proceeds from dispositions primarily due to our sale of aviation week and the sale of an equity investment held by crisil these decreases were partially offset by an increase related to cash outflows for the purchase of shortterm investments in 2013 compared to cash inflows from shortterm investments in 2012 

refer to note 2 – acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

financing activities 

our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases dividends and repayment of debt while cash inflows are primarily inflows from commercial paper borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

cash used for financing activities decreased  13 billion  to  462 million  in 2014 this decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases and the repayment of shortterm debt that occurred in the first quarter of 2013 

cash used for financing activities increased  838 million  to  17 billion  in 2013 this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in cash used for share repurchases the repayment of shortterm debt in the first quarter of 2013 and the purchase of crisil equity shares in the third quarter of 2013 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash used for dividends paid to shareholders due to a special dividend paid in 2012 and the payment related to the maturity of our 400 million 5375 senior notes in november of 2012 

during 2014 we used cash to repurchase 46 million shares for 362 million at an average price paid per share of 7902 excluding commissions included in the repurchase were 05 million shares of the companys common stock from the personal holdings of harold w mcgraw iii chairman of the companys board of directors and former president and ceo of the company mr mcgraw the shares were purchased at a discount of 035 from the june 24 2014 new york stock exchange closing price pursuant to a private transaction with mr mcgraw we repurchased these shares with cash for 41 million at an average price of 8266 per share this transaction was approved by the nominating and corporate governance committee of the companys board of directors after consultation with members of the financial policy committee 

during 2013 we used cash to repurchase 168 million shares for 978 million including commissions the average price per share excluding commissions was 5836 an additional 01 million shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2013 for approximately 10 million which settled in january of 2014 including these additional shares we utilized cash to repurchase shares at an average price of 5852 excluding commissions during 2012 we used cash to repurchase 68 million shares for 295 million including commissions the average price per share excluding commissions was 5035 the average price per share for 2012 does not include the accelerated share repurchase transaction as discussed in more detail in note 8 – equity to our consolidated financial statements the repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

on december 4 2013 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares the “2013 repurchase program” which was approximately 18 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time the 2013 repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions depending on market conditions as of december 31 2014  456 million  shares remained available under the 2013 repurchase program 

discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations reflects the classification of mcgraw hill construction and mhe as discontinued operations 

cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations of 18 million  in 2014 relates to mcgraw hill construction and cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations of 231 million  in 2013 relates both to mhe and mcgraw hill construction cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations was 231 million  in 2013 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 537 million  in 2012 primarily as a result of the completion of the sale of mhe that occurred on march 22 2013 

cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations decreased to 320 million  in 2014 compared to 21 billion  in 2013 due to lower proceeds received from the sale of mcgraw hill construction compared to the proceeds received from the sale of mhe cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was 21 billion  in 2013 compared to cash used for investing activities from discontinued operations of 199 million  in 2012 the increase in 2013 is primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of mhe in 2013 

cash used for financing activities decreased  25 million  in 2014 as there was no impact related to mcgraw hill construction and increased 13 million  in 2013 related to the sale of mhe 

additional financing 

currently we have the ability to borrow a total of 10 billion  through our commercial paper program which is supported by our 10 billion fouryear credit agreement our credit facility that we entered into in june 2013 and will terminate on june 19 2017 as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no outstanding commercial paper 

we pay a commitment fee of 20  to 45  basis points for our credit facility depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio whether or not amounts have been borrowed and currently pay a commitment fee of 20  basis points the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is at our option calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london interbank offer rate the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate for certain borrowings under this credit facility there is also a spread based on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate 

our credit facility contains certain covenants the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility is not greater than 325  to 1  and this covenant has never been exceeded 

on january 22 2015 fitch ratings revised its ratings outlook from negative to stable and affirmed our bbb longterm debt rating and f2 shorttermcommercial debt rating 

dividends 

on february 12 2015 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from 030 per share to 033 per share 

on december 6 2012 our board of directors approved a special dividend in the amount of 250 per share on our common stock payable on december 27 2012 to shareholders on record on december 18 2012 

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2015  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2014  over the next several years that relate to our continuing operations additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table   



 

as of december 31 2014  we had 118 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2014  we have recorded 810 million  for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 8 – equity  to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cgis will have the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2014  we contributed 22 million  and 9 million  to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively expected employer contributions in 2015 are 15 million  and 10 million  for our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2015 we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 6 – employee benefits  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt make strategic acquisitions and investments repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs 

the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities unless otherwise indicated all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized as it is earned when services are rendered we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable we make our best estimate of the services’ stand alone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately in such cases we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period 

for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2015  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 10 million 

for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2015  

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

on july 31 2014 we completed the sale of the companys aircraft to harold w mcgraw iii chairman of the companys board of directors and former president and ceo of the company for a purchase price of 20 million  during the second quarter of 2014 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 6 million  within other loss income in our consolidated statement of income as a result of the pending sale see note 13 – related party transactions  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

on june 30 2014 we completed the sale of our data center to quality technology services llc “qts” which owns operates and manages data centers net proceeds from the sale of 58 million  were received in july of 2014 the sale includes all of the facilities and equipment on the south campus of our east windsor new jersey location inclusive of the rights and obligations associated with an adjoining solar power field the sale resulted in an expense of 3 million  recorded within other loss income in our consolidated statement of income which is in addition to the noncash impairment charge of 36 million  we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 to adjust the value facilities and associated infrastructure classified as held for sale to their fair value 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we also incurred a 26 million  noncash impairment charge associated with an intangible asset acquired through the formation of our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture 

there were no material impairments of longlived assets for the year ended december 31 2012 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2014  and 2013  the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 21 billion and 20 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired

as part of our annual impairment test of our 4 reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test for 2014  based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at our sp ratings sp capital iq sp dj indices and cc operating segments and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



 

in addition to the assumptions in the above table assumed mortality is also a key assumption in determining benefit obligations at december 31 2014 the company updated the assumed mortality rates to reflect life expectancy improvements 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted in 2012 stock options were not granted as part of employees total stockbased incentive awards 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2015  if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

on the basis of present information it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within those foreign operations accordingly we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability which may be material to our future reported results financial position and cash flows 

for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes however certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in sp dj indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows longterm growth rates the timing and nature of tax attributes and the redemption features 

recent   accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods

total expenses 

the following tables provide an analysis by segment of our operatingrelated expenses and selling and general expenses for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  



 operatingrelated expenses 

operatingrelated expenses increased  98 million  or 7  as compared to 2012  primarily driven by increased costs at sp ratings and sp capital iq at sp ratings the increases were primarily a result of higher personnel costs including incentive compensation at sp capital iq the increases were primarily a result of additional headcount in developing regions and costs to further develop our content and purchase new data sets this was partially offset by lower compensation expense at cc due to a reduction in headcount from recent restructuring actions 

intersegment eliminations relates to a royalty charged to sp capital iq for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by sp ratings 

selling and general expenses 

selling and general expenses were impacted by growth and value plan related costs of 64 million and 226 million for 2013 and 2012 respectively 2013 costs were primarily driven by additional professional fees and costs related to our separation from mhe 2012 costs primarily include professional fees charges associated with our outsourcing initiatives severance charges a charge related to a reduction in our lease commitments and transaction costs for our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture additionally 2013 was also impacted by pretax legal settlements of approximately 77 million and charges we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 as we continued to evaluate our remaining cost structure particularly in light of recent divestitures 

this resulted in 28 million of restructuring charges primarily related to severance associated with streamlining our management structure and our decision to exit nonstrategic businesses and 13 million related to terminating various leases as we reduce our real estate portfolio 

excluding these costs selling and general expenses increased compared to 2012  primarily due to higher costs associated with increased sales and additional incentive compensation driven by improved performance at sp ratings and sp dj indices the increase in 2013 at sp dj indices was also impacted by a 26 million noncash impairment charge associated with an intangible 

asset acquired through the formation of our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization decreased 4 million  or 3  as compared to 2012  primarily due to asset write offs in 2013 as we consolidated office locations partially offset by additional intangible asset amortization related to our acquisitions in 2012 

the following tables provide an analysis by segment of our operatingrelated expenses and selling and general expenses for the years ended december 31 2012  and 2011  



 

operatingrelated expenses 

operatingrelated expenses increased 99 million  or 7  as compared to 2011  primarily driven by increased costs at sp ratings of 46 million  or 7  and sp capital iq of 73 million  or 19  these increases were primarily a result of higher personnel costs including incentive compensation at sp ratings and global staff increases at sp capital iq this was partially offset by lower compensation expense at cc of 6 million or 8 due to a reduction in headcount from recent restructuring actions 

intersegment eliminations relates to a royalty charged to sp capital iq for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by sp ratings 

selling and general expenses 

during 2012 we recorded 226 million  of growth and value plan related costs necessary to enable separation and reduce our cost structure which includes professional fees severance charges transaction costs for our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture and a charge related to a reduction in our lease commitments excluding these costs and 10 million of growth and value plan costs for 2011 selling and general expenses increased 71 million as compared to 2011  due to higher costs associated with increased sales and additional stockbased compensation mainly due to higher expected performance achievement and an increase in the grant price of our equity awards personnel costs increased 44 million at sp ratings 20 million at cc 7 million at sp dj indices and 4 million at sp capital iq as revenue growth improved 15  9  20  and 9  respectively in addition sp ratings had increased legal costs as compared to 2011 

total costs incurred since the growth and value plan was announced in september of 2011 have been 361 million  of which 300 million  have been recorded in continuing operations and 61 million  have been recorded in discontinued operations these are costs that have been necessary to enable separation reduce our cost structure accelerate growth and increase shareholder value 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization increased 15 million  or 12  as compared to 2011  primarily due to additional intangible asset amortization related to our recent acquisitions partially offset by reduced purchases of furniture and computer equipment last year as we focused on continued cost controls 

other loss income 

during 2013 we recorded a net pretax loss of 12 million within other loss income in the consolidated statement of income 

 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a pretax gain of 52 million within other loss income in the consolidated statement of income related to a change in our vacation policy the change in our vacation policy modified the number of days that employees are entitled to for unused vacation time upon termination of employment   as they will only be paid for vacation days equivalent to what they have earned in the current year 

during 2011 we recorded a pretax gain of 13 million within other loss income in the consolidated statement of income which related to the sale of our interest in linkedin corporation in their initial public offering this investment was held within our cc segment 

operating profit 

we consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we define operating profit as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and selling and general expenses we also further evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate 

we internally manage our operations by reference to “segment operating profit” and resources are allocated primarily based on segment operating profit segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before allocated expenses which are centrally managed costs and do not affect the operating results of our segments segment operating profit is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance segment operating profit is not however a measure of financial performance under us gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 



 

segment operating profit —  increased 283 million  or 19  as compared to 2012  segment operating income margins were 37  and 34  for 2013  and 2012  respectively substantial revenue growth at corporate ratings and sp dj indices and strong demand for platts proprietary content were the primary drivers of the increase see “segment review” below for further information 

unallocated expense   —  increased by 89 million  or 29  as compared to 2012  unallocated expense was impacted by growth and value related plan costs at our corporate headquarters of 64 million in 2013 and 156 million in 2012 unallocated expense in 2013 was also impacted by pretax legal settlements of approximately 77 million a 36 million noncash impairment charge related to the facilities and associated infrastructure of one of our data centers that we are in the process of selling and 13 million related to terminating various leases as we reduce our real estate portfolio in 2012 unallocated expense was partially offset by a vacation accrual reversal of 52 million excluding these items unallocated expense increased slightly compared to 2012 primarily due to increased unoccupied office space 

foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 20 million on operating profit for 2013  this impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between currentyear and prioryear foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business functional currency 

  

segment operating profit —  increased  214 million  or 16  as compared to 2011 segment operating income margins were 34  and 33  for 2012 and 2011 respectively restructuring charges and other nonrecurring charges as noted above mitigated the margin improvement for the period see “segment review” below for further information in addition segment operating profit benefited from reduced pension costs as we froze our us employee retirement plan effective on april 1 2012 

unallocated expense   —  increased by 80 million  or 36  as compared to 2011 mainly as a result of 156 million of growth and value plan related costs necessary to enable separation and reduce our cost structure which includes professional fees of 117 million and restructuring charges of 21 million this was partially offset by a vacation accrual reversal of 52 million unallocated expenses also includes an increase for costs that were previously allocated to mhe such as costs for centralized departments that could not be classified as discontinued operations due to the nature of the expense 

foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 6 million on operating profit for 2012  

interest expense net 

net interest expense for 2013 decreased 26  as compared to 2012  primarily driven by the maturity of our 400 million 5375 senior notes on november 15 2012 net interest expense for 2012 increased 4 as compared to 2011  primarily due to increased interest expense related to uncertain tax positions as well as lower international interest income from our investments in 2012  compared with 2011  

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 329 358 and 374 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in the 2013 effective tax rate from the prior year period was primarily due to the full year effect of the partnership structure of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture an increase in income in lower tax rate jurisdictions and tax planning the decrease in the 2012 effective tax rate from the prior year period was primarily due to the partnership structure of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture the growth and value plan and restructuring costs incurred primarily in the united states 

including discontinued operations the effective tax rate was 331 458 and 365 for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in the 2013 and the increase in the 2012 effective tax rates including discontinued operations was primarily due to the goodwill impairment recorded at mhe in 2012 additionally the 2013 effective tax rate including discontinued operations was favorably impacted by the items listed above for continuing operations 

discontinued operations net 

income from discontinued operations was 563 million  in 2013 as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of 234 million in 2012 primarily as a result of an aftertax gain of 589 million  recorded on the sale of mhe in 2013 

loss from discontinued operations was 234 million in 2012 as compared to income from discontinued operations of 308 million in 2011 primarily as a result of revenue declines and several nonrecurring items 

revenue at mhe decreased 230 million or 10 as compared to 2011 primarily due to decreases in the adoption states as well as open territory sales at school education group also contributing to the reduction was a substantial increase in deferred revenue due to higher sales of programs that contain digital components that will be delivered over multiple years in the higher education professional and international group sales of new editions have been impacted by the growth of the used book and rental market however digital sales across mhe continue to increase as compared to 2011

segment review 

sp ratings 

credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments they are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer such as a corporation or state or city government to meet its financial obligations in full and on time our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue such as a corporate or municipal bond and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default 

sp ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and nontransaction transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with 

 

nontransaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating annual fees for customer relationshipbased pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings 



  

revenue 

both transaction and nontransaction revenue grew compared to 2012 with transaction revenue growing at a higher rate additionally both domestic and international revenue in 2013 grew compared to 2012 with international growing at a faster pace reflecting strong growth in europe as the economic outlook has improved 

transaction revenue grew in 2013 due to strong highyield corporate bond issuance in the us during the first half of 2013 and in europe for the full year driven by refinancing activity and borrowers taking advantage of lower rates increases in us and europe bank loan ratings resulting from refinancing activity also contributed to the full year increase these increases were partially offset by a decline in us corporate bond issuance in the second half of the year reflecting interest rate volatility in the early part of the third quarter of 2013 and challenging comparisons to 2012 related to robust refinancing activity additionally transaction revenue was favorably impacted by growth in structured finance revenues driven primarily by increased issuance of us collateralized loan obligations clo and us commercial mortgagebacked securities 

nontransaction revenue increased in 2013 due to growth in nonissuance related revenue for corporate ratings primarily for entity credit ratings in the us and europe and increased res activity additionally crisils acquisition of coalition development ltd in july of 2012 had a favorable impact nontransaction revenue includes an intersegment royalty charged to sp capital iq for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by sp ratings royalty revenue for 2013  and 2012 was 72 million  and 69 million  respectively 

foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 5 million on revenue for 2013 

transaction revenue grew significantly in 2012 as compared to 2011 driven by strong highyield and investment grade corporate bond issuance related to robust refinancing activity borrowers took advantage of low rates replacing existing bonds with cheaper debt particularly in the second half of 2012 as issuers refinanced in advance of the uncertainty surrounding the us fiscal cliff and presidential election the significant increase was also attributable to weak results in the second half of 2011 resulting from the impacts of the sovereign difficulties in europe and a slow economic recovery additionally increases in 2012 in public finance contributed to growth in transaction revenue primarily from strong municipal bond issuance in the us as refunding activity increased dramatically over 2011 strong growth in bank loan ratings resulting from a favorable interest rate environment was also a key driver contributing to the growth in structured finance revenues specifically an increase in us clo transaction revenue us asset backed securities abs transaction revenue also increased due to favorable spreads expansion of both bank and nonbank issuance and solid refinancing activity of student loans 

nontransaction revenue remained relatively flat in 2012 as growth in nonissuance related revenue at corporate ratings primarily for entity credit ratings and res was offset by declines in annual fees and program fees in structured finance annual fees include surveillance fees and other customer relationshipbased fees additionally crisils acquisition of coalition development ltd in july of 2012 had a favorable impact on nontransaction revenue in 2012 nontransaction revenue includes an intersegment 

royalty charged to sp capital iq for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by sp ratings royalty revenue for 2012  and 2011 was 69 million and 63 million respectively 

foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 37 million on revenue for 2012 

operating profit 

operating profit increased compared to 2012  due to the increases in revenue as noted above additionally the gain on sale of an equity investment held by crisil of 16 million   in 2013 and the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 11 million   also contributed to the increase in operating profit these increases were partially offset by increased compliance and regulatory costs higher incentive costs due to improved performance increased advertising expenses higher technology investments and crisils acquisition of coalition development ltd in july of 2012 

operating profit increased compared to 2011 primarily due to the increases in revenue as noted above these increases were partially offset by increased expenses resulting from higher incentive costs due to improved financial performance an increase in legal expenses restructuring charges of 15 million in the second half of 2012 consisting of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 100 positions crisils acquisition of coalition development ltd in july of 2012 and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 13 million 

issuance volumes 

we monitor issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within sp ratings issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer issuance volumes can be reported in two ways by “domicile” which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located or based on “marketplace” which is where the bonds are sold the following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on thomson financial harrison scott publications dealogic and sp rating’s internal estimates 



 

 

 

industry highlights and outlook 

revenue growth in 2013 was primarily driven by strong highyield bond issuance in the us in the first half of the year and in europe for the full year additionally us and europe bank loan ratings increased driven by refinancing activity us highyield bond issuance levels decreased in the second half of 2013 reflecting interest rate volatility in the beginning of the third quarter of 2013 and difficult comparisons to robust performance in the second half of 2012 in 2014 debt issuance and bank loan rating activity is expected to continue growing at a lower pace as many refinancings were completed in 2013 however we believe the longer term outlook for the corporate bond market continues to be healthy 

structured finance issuance in the us is expected to continue its steady recovery in 2014 and improving economic conditions and increased investor confidence in europe should provide opportunities for additional issuance healthy us rmbs and us cmbs levels are expected to continue in 2014 the us cdo market continued to experience strong activity in 2013 we expect the clo market in 2014 to be comparable to 2013 us abs issuance volume decreased slightly in 2013 however we expect modest issuance growth in 2014 driven by solid auto and credit card issuance offset by lower ffelp student loan refinancing activity 

legal and regulatory environment

others to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements sp ratings expects regulators in additional countries to introduce new regulations in the future 

we have reviewed the new laws regulations and rules which have been adopted and have implemented or are planning to implement changes as required we do not believe that such new laws regulations or rules will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations other laws regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local national foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies the impact on us of the adoption of any such laws regulations or rules remains uncertain but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to sp rating’s rating activities

revenue 

revenue grew compared to 2012 primarily due growth at capital iq and ratingsxpress® partially offset by an unfavorable impact related to the closure of several noncore businesses and declines in several of our investment research products 

the increase at capital iq was driven by market share gains and increased contract values for existing accounts the number of users on the desktop continues to show strong growth over 2012 contract value growth continues to be driven by success in the corporate and investment management client segments these segments are also growing as a result of our bundled solution offerings integrated within the capital iq platform increased contract values were also driven by new datasets and expanded coverage of existing datasets combined with improved functionality and performance of the capital iq platform 

both domestic and international revenue increased over 2012 however international increased at a higher rate due to the continued sales growth of capital iq in europe and asia and the growth of quanthouse international growth was partially offset by our decision to close certain businesses and products within proprietary research 

the subscription base for ratingsxpress® is growing due to new client relationships and expanded relationships within existing accounts as the number of customers have increased 5 in 2013 as compared to 2012 ratingsxpress® has benefited from increased compliance requirements which has created a greater need for alternative risk tools improvements made to the speed and timeliness through delivery on the xpressfeed platform has also contributed to growth in ratingsxpress® sales related to ratingsdirect® have increased more toward the second half of 2013 as the product is now also available on the capital iq platform and growth in contract values is also being driven by being able to sell bundled packages with other sp capital iq data sets 

the 2012 acquisitions of quanthouse and credit market analysis limited also contributed to the increase in revenue 

revenue grew compared to 2011 primarily due to growth at capital iq ratingsxpress® and the acquisitions of r² technologies quanthouse and cma 

the increase at capital iq was driven by market share gains and increased contract values for existing accounts however headcount reductions in the financial services industry have tempered growth the number of clients have still increased 7 in 2012 from 2011 and the spend from the top accounts continued to grow the client increase includes a certain percentage of clients on themarketscom platform that have been migrated to the capital iq platform the subscription base for ratingsdirect® increased slightly as difficult market conditions due to budget constraints and reductions in headcount across the customer base affected revenue in 2012 clients continued to reduce staff levels to manage their spending levels and layoffs continued to be announced through the fourth quarter of 2012 

the subscription base for ratingsxpress® grew from new client relationships and expanded relationships into existing accounts as the number of ratingsxpress® customers increased 10 in 2012 as compared to 2011 however average contract values for those customers declined due to customer budget constraints amidst difficult market conditions client cancellations were also higher than in 2011 due to increased merger and acquisition activity during the year that caused those clients to reevaluate their subscriptions 

traditionally revenue has been primarily domestic however due to increases in europe for the subscription base for ratingsxpress® continued sales efforts of the capital iq desktop in europe and asia and recent acquisitions in europe international growth continued to occur throughout 2012 

operating profit 

operating profit increased slightly as compared to 2012 due to the increase in revenue as discussed above lower expenses resulting from the closure of several noncore businesses reductions in outside consulting fees lower restructuring costs in 2013 as compared to 2012 and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 9 million partially offsetting the increases to operating profit were higher incentive costs due to improved performance increased costs of sales for exchange fees incurred by quanthouse costs related to additional headcount in developing regions and a loss on the sale of financial communications of 3 million in 2013 

operating profit decreased slightly as compared to 2011 2012 was significantly impacted by restructuring charges of 19 million recorded in the second half of 2012 consisting of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 150 positions the 2012 acquisitions also contributed to the decrease particularly due to amortization charges relating to the intangible assets also impacting operating profit were staff increases primarily in developing regions increased technology costs to support the growth in the employee base and costs to further develop our content and software these decreases were partially offset by the increase in revenue discussed above and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 7 million 

industry highlights and outlook 

enhancements to the segments content and platforms and growing the client base were key areas of focus in 2013 new datasets and expanded coverage of existing datasets combined with improved functionality of the capital iq platform contributed to the segments revenue growth in 2013 platform releases have been focused on improving reliability scalability and product performance improvements to the speed and timeliness through the delivery on the xpressfeed platform and the ability to sell bundled packages with other sp capital iq data sets also contributed to revenue growth at ratingsxpress® the integration of their services on their delivery platforms and introduction of new analytic and data solutions to the market place contributed to customer growth at capital iq and ratingsxpress® in 2013 

in 2014 the segment will continue to focus on integrating and evolving its assets and capabilities into one scaled business that offers unique highvalue offerings across all asset classes sp capital iq will continue to strive to build new functionality filling critical capability gaps to bolster their foundation for future growth

sp dj indices generates subscription revenue but primarily derives revenue from nonsubscription products based on the sp and dow jones indices specifically sp dj indices generate revenue from the following sources 

 



revenue 

revenue at sp dj indices grew compared to 2012 primarily due to the incremental revenue from the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture excluding the incremental revenue from the joint venture revenue increased primarily due higher average levels of assets under management for etf products the trend toward etf products continued in 2013 driving a fourth consecutive quarterly record for etf assets under management in the fourth quarter of 2013 volumes for exchangetraded derivatives continued to increase primarily for certain chicago board options exchange cboe products higher rates for certain new contracts also contributed to revenue growth in 2013 

40 new etfs were launched during 2013 compared to 85 launched during 2012 assets under management for etfs rose 43 to 668 billion in 2013 from 466 billion in 2012 as the etf market becomes more mature we are beginning to evaluate those etfs that have been launched that have not been as successful and making efforts to close them down assets under management for the fourth quarter of 2013 were 14 higher than the record amount set in the third quarter of 2013 and sp dj indices is the leading index provider for the etf market with assets representing 29 of global etf assets 

revenue at sp dj indices increased 20 primarily due to the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture excluding revenue from the joint venture sp dj indices revenue increased 3 primarily due to higher average levels of assets under management for etf products and higher mutual fund revenue both domestic and international revenue increased in 2012 over 2011 primarily due to the joint venture excluding this impact domestic revenue was still up however international decreased due lower reported overthecounter derivative trades in europe 

85 new etfs were launched during 2012 compared to 77 launched during 2011 assets under management for etfs excluding those contributed from formation of the joint venture rose 28 to 402 billion in 2012 from 314 billion in 2011 

operating profit 

operating profit increased due to the increase in revenue as discussed above and from the reduction of transaction costs associated with our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture in 2012 this was partially offset by the impact of higher data fees increased incentive costs due to improved financial performance and higher marketing costs due to increased advertising levels as building the sp dj indices brand was a focus in 2013 the increase in 2013 was also partially offset by the impact of a full year of expenses for our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture additionally we incurred a 26 million noncash impairment charge associated with an intangible asset acquired through the formation of our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture 

in the fourth quarter of 2013 we acquired the intellectual property rights to a range of commodities indices developed by goldman sachs as well as a limiteduse license to promote the commodities indices using the goldman sachs commodity index trade marks this transaction will allow us to eliminate applicable royalty obligations going forward and will favorably impact operating profit beginning in 2014 

operating profit increased due to the increase in revenue discussed above partially offset by the impact of expenses for our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture higher data fees and additional personnel costs for targeted staff increases 

industry highlights and outlook 

sp dj indices the leading index provider for the etf market space grew in 2013 as the trend toward etfs continued driving record aum levels in 2014 we expect this favorable trend to continue driving higher aum levels over the longterm the segment will also seek to continue to launch new etfs where they see a customer interest or opportunity this group anticipates continuing to see opportunities in products internationally primarily in the middle east and asia

revenue 

revenue at cc increased due to continued demand for platts’ proprietary content as platts’ revenue grew by 13   with consistent growth across all regions this growth was mainly driven by strength in platts’ market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors led by petroleum complimented by gains in demand for shipping data and risk forward curve products additionally growth has been driven by the continued licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to various commodity exchanges while petroleum is still the biggest driver the revenue mix continues to become more diversified as other sectors showed positive growth including petrochemicals natural gas coal and metals and agriculture the acquisition of kingsman in the fourth quarter of 2012 also contributed to the growth in the agriculture sector platts represents 54 of total cc revenue 

excluding the impact of aviation week commercial markets revenue was up slightly in the year as increases at jd power offset revenue declines at mcgrawhill construction revenue at jd power for 2013 represented a record revenue year revenue growth was due to strong demand in china for auto consulting engagements growth in us auto driven by additional consulting and proprietary engagements and growth in the us power information network® pin pin provides realtime automotive information and decisionsupport tools based on the collection and analysis of daily new and usedvehicle retail transaction data from thousands of automotive franchises international revenue at jd power increased 13 for the year as compared to 2012 the asiapacific region represents approximately 31 of jd powers total revenue 

mcgrawhill constructions revenue was down primarily driven by declines in their subscription business however new analytic products and enhancements continue to show growth and customer retention improved over 2012 media revenue at mcgrawhill construction also improved over 2012 due to strong growth in advertising and events 2013 full year revenue performance is the best revenue growth performance for mcgrawhill construction since 2008 

revenue at cc increased primarily due to continued demand for platts’ proprietary content and by growth across our automotive sectors at jd power primarily in asia and the united states 

platts’ revenue grew by 17 and represents 50 of total cc revenue with growth across all regions this growth was mainly driven by strength in platts’ market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors led by petroleum and natural gas while petroleum is still the biggest driver the revenue mix is becoming more diversified as metals and global trading services have shown strong growth year over year excluding recent acquisitions annualized contract values for platts top 250 customers have increased 13 as compared to 2011 and those customers represent approximately 67 of platts total annualized contract value the two strategic acquisitions in 2011 bentek energy llc in january and steel business briefing group in july also contributed to the increase in revenue at platts all commodity sectors have also shown very strong renewal rates for subscription products during the year 

jd power had revenue growth across their global automotive sectors including automotive consulting and pin growth occurred across the majority of regions most notably china and japan international growth was 14 and represents 37 of the total revenue also contributing to the increase at jd power was an increase in their roundtables and events as well as licensing revenue associated with syndicated studies 

partially offsetting these increases at cc were declines in mcgrawhill construction as market contraction declines have continued to impact revenue however growth related to new products and enhancements is gaining traction 

operating profit 

operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue at platts and jd power as noted above growth at jd power was also due to lower expenses primarily due to increased productivity and lower incentive costs mcgrawhill construction has also contributed to the increase as decreases in the expenses driven by headcount lower advertising and promotion expense and product investment savings have outpaced revenue declines additionally the sale of aviation week during the third quarter of 2013 resulted in a pretax gain of 11 million partially offsetting the increases at platts were additional headcount and other operating costs to support business growth 

operating profit increased primarily due to the revenue growth described above and a strong focus on the management of expenses across the brands the nonrecurring items that impacted operating profit in the prior year also contributed to the increase in 2012 offsetting the increase were additional costs primarily related to revenue growth additional incentive costs at platts and jd power and restructuring charges of 12 million that were recorded in the second half of 2012 consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 110 positions 

industry highlights and outlook 

cc expects to continue to invest in digital capabilities that will enable our brands to become more integrated compete more effectively in the marketplace and create a foundation for the development of new products and revenue streams the segment expects to further expand its presence in selected markets and geographies to help drive growth 

the continuing growth in oil demand and the uncertainty of supply causes volatility in energy prices which will drive market participant demand for platts proprietary content including news price assessments and analytics the international energy agency projects that world oil consumption will rise to 924 million barrels per day in 2014 a gain of 12 million barrels per day compared to 2013 in 2014 platts will continue to invest in technology and customer engagement activities to seek to drive additional revenue growth across all commodity sectors they will also seek to continue to leverage the capabilities and content from recent acquisitions and expand into adjacent markets similar to 2013 they expect to continue to introduce a number of new products and price assessments within all commodity sectors platts will also seek to continue to ensure readiness for adherence to the international organization of securities commissions iosco principles and while the principles focus on oil platts is ensuring that processes related to all commodities are in adherence with the principles

in 2013 free cash flow of 624 million  was relatively flat compared to 626 million  in 2012 the slight decrease was a result of higher dividends and payments to noncontrolling interests and an increase in capital expenditures partially offset by the increase in cash flow from operating activities discussed below free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects see “reconciliation of nongaap financial information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities increased  69 million  to  816 million  in 2013 the increase is mainly due to higher operating results and improved cash collections in 2013 impacting accounts receivable these increases were partially offset by a tax payment made in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 our legal settlements and higher incentive compensation payments in 2013 reflecting greater achievement against targeted results in 2012 as compared to 2011 

cash provided by operating activities decreased  177 million  to  747 million  in 2012 mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher billings at sp ratings sp indices and sp capital iq in 2012 compared to 2011 and higher pension plan contributions in 2012 partially offset by higher income taxes payable as the irs extended the due date for the fourth quarter estimated income tax payment until the first quarter of 2013 and higher payments to vendors in 2011 

investing activities 

our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures while cash inflows are primarily from dispositions 

cash used for investing activities decreased  117 million  to  130 million  for 2013 primarily due to a lower amount of cash paid for acquisitions and higher proceeds from dispositions primarily due to our sale of aviation week and the sale of an equity investment held by crisil these decreases were partially offset by an increase related to cash outflows for the purchase of shortterm investments in 2013 compared to cash inflows from shortterm investments in 2012 

cash used for investing activities decreased  24 million  to  247 million  for 2012 primarily due to a higher amount of cash inflows from shortterm investments and a lower amount of cash paid for acquisitions partially offset by lower proceeds from dispositions due to the sale of our interest in linkedin corporation in 2011 

refer to note 2 – acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

financing activities 

our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases dividends and repayment of debt while cash inflows are primarily inflows from commercial paper borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

cash used for financing activities increased  838 million  to  17 billion  in 2013 this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in cash used for share repurchases the repayment of shortterm debt in the first quarter of 2013 and the purchase of crisil equity shares in the third quarter of 2013 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cash used for dividends paid to shareholders due to a special dividend paid in 2012 and the payment related to the maturity of our 400 million 5375 senior notes in november of 2012 

cash used for financing activities decreased  755 million  to  905 million  in 2012 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases partially offset by an increase in dividends paid to shareholders due to a special dividend payment in 2012 

during 2013 we used cash to repurchase 168 million shares for 978 million including commissions the average price per share excluding commissions was 5836 an additional 01 million shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter of 2013 for approximately 10 million which settled in january of 2014 including these additional shares we utilized cash to repurchase shares at an average price of 5852 excluding commissions during 2012 we used cash to repurchase 68 million shares for 295 million including commissions the average price per share excluding commissions was 5035 during 2011 we utilized cash to repurchase 347 million shares for 15 billion including commissions the average price per share excluding commissions was 4048 the average price per share for 2012 and 2011 does not include the accelerated share repurchase transactions as discussed in more detail in note 8 – equity to our consolidated financial statements the repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options 

on december 4 2013 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares the “2013 repurchase program” which was approximately 18 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time the 2013 repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions depending on market conditions as of december 31 2013 50 million shares remained available under the 2013 repurchase program 

discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations reflects the classification of mhe and the broadcasting group as discontinued operations 

cash used for operating activities from discontinued operations was 265 million  compared to cash provided by operating activities of 520 million  in 2012 as a result of the completion of the sale of mhe that occurred on march 22 2013 cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations increased  100 million  to  520 million  in 2012 compared to 2011 the increase in 2012 is primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivables as a result of lower sales year over year at mhe higher unearned revenue at school education group and lower inventory purchases 

cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was  21 billion  in 2013 compared to cash used for investing activities from discontinued operations of  198 million  in 2012 the increase in 2013 is primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of mhe in 2013 cash used for investing activities from discontinued operations of 198 million  in 2012 compared to cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of 25 million in 2011 primarily due to proceeds received for the sale of the broadcasting group in 2011 

cash used for financing activities increased  13 million  to  25 million  in 2013 and increased  8 million  to  12 million  in 2012 

additional financing 

currently we have the ability to borrow a total of 10 billion  through our commercial paper program which is supported by our credit facility described below as of december 31 2013 there were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding in connection with the december 2012 special dividend in the amount of 250 per share on our common stock we utilized our commercial 

paper program and as a result commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2012 totaled 457 million  with an average interest rate and term of 048  and 28 days  

on june 19 2013 we entered into a  10 billion  fouryear credit agreement our “credit facility” that will terminate on june 19 2017 this credit facility replaced our  12 billion  threeyear credit facility that was scheduled to terminate on july 30 2013 the previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective there were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced 

we pay a commitment fee of 20  to 45  basis points for our credit facility depending on our indebtedness to cash flow ratio whether or not amounts have been borrowed and currently pay a commitment fee of 25  basis points the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is at our option calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london interbank offer rate the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate for certain borrowings under this credit facility there is also a spread based on our indebtness to cash flow ratio added to the applicable rate 

our credit facility contains certain covenants the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility is not greater than 325  to 1  and this covenant has never been exceeded 

on february 7 2013 fitch ratings downgraded our credit rating to bbb from a and placed our ratings on rating watch negative there has been no change to our shortterm  commercial paper rating of f2 from fitch ratings on february 14 2013 moodys investors service downgraded our credit rating from a3 to baa2 with negative outlook in march 2013 upon the completion of the sale of mcgrawhill education moodys withdrew our credit ratings due to moodys own business reasons 

dividends 

on january 29 2014 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from 028 per share to 030 per share 

on december 6 2012 our board of directors approved a special dividend in the amount of 250 per share on our common stock payable on december 27 2012 to shareholders on record on december 18 2012 

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2014 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2013 over the next several years that relate to our continuing operations additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table   



 40 

 

as of december 31 2013 we had 82 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

as of december 31 2013 we have recorded 810 million for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our sp dow jones indices llc partnership discussed in note 2 – acquisitions and divestitures  to our consolidated financial statements specifically this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of sp dow jones indices llc whereby after december 31 2017 cme group and cgis will have the right at any time to sell and we are obligated to buy at least 20 of their share in sp dow jones indices llc we have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2013 we contributed 27 million and 9 million to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively expected employer contributions in 2014 are 23 million and 10 million for our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2014 we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 6 – employee benefits  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt make strategic acquisitions and investments repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs 

the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities unless otherwise indicated all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized as it is earned when goods are shipped to customers or services are rendered we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable we make our best estimate of the services’ stand alone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately in such cases we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period 

for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2014 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 10 million 

for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2014 

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets 

during the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered the final stages of discussions to sell the facilities and associated infrastructure equipment of one of our data centers to a third party causing us to recognize an impairment charge of 36 million for the year ended december 31 2013 to adjust the value facilities and associated infrastructure classified as held for sale to their fair value additionally we incurred a 26 million noncash impairment charge associated with the an intangible asset acquired through the formation of our sp dow jones indices llc joint venture 

there were no material impairments of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 20 billion and 21 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our 4 reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test for 2013 based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at our sp ratings sp capital iq sp dj indices and cc operating segments and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants while we believe that the 

assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

 

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted in 2012 stock options were not granted as part of employees total stockbased incentive awards 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2014 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable on the basis of present information it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within those foreign operations accordingly we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability which may be material to our future reported results financial position and cash flows 

for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes however certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in sp dj indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows longterm growth rates the timing and nature of tax attributes and the redemption features 

recent   accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

there have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the year ended december 31 2013 our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities as of december 31 2013 we have entered into an immaterial amount of foreign exchange forwards to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

on september 12 2011 we announced that our board of directors had unanimously approved a comprehensive growth and value plan that includes separation into two companies mcgraw hill financial mhf focused on providing essential information to the capital commodities and commercial markets and mcgrawhill education mhe focused on education products and services and digital learning the growth and value plan has been focused on accelerating growth and increasing shareholder value through not only this separation but also through substantial costcutting initiatives and increased share repurchases 

as we approach the completion of our growth and value plan we have achieved our objectives under our growth and value plan relating to the separation of mhe cost reductions increased shareholder return and investing  divesting in targeted assets that position us for longterm growth 

separation of mhe 

our board of directors determined that the separation would provide benefits to the company including 

 

the timing of completing the separation has been dependent on many factors including whether the separation occurs through a spinoff to our shareholders or a sale after carefully considering all of the options for creating shareholder value our board of directors concluded that a sale of mhe would generate the best value and certainty for our shareholders and most favorably position mhe for longterm success

growth and value plan actions 

on september 12 2011 we announced that our board of directors had unanimously approved a comprehensive growth and value plan that includes separation into two companies mcgraw hill financial mhf focused on providing essential information to the capital commodities and commercial markets and mcgrawhill education mhe focused on education products and services and digital learning the growth and value plan has been focused on accelerating growth and increasing shareholder value through not only this separation but also through substantial costcutting initiatives and increased share repurchases 

as we approach the completion of the growth and value plan we have achieved our objectives under our growth and value plan relating to the separation of mhe cost reductions increased shareholder return and investing  divesting in targeted assets that position us for longterm growth 

separation of mhe 

the timing of completing the separation has been dependent on many factors including whether the separation occurs through a spinoff to our shareholders or a sale after carefully considering all of the options for creating shareholder value our board of directors concluded that a sale of mhe would generate the best value and certainty for our shareholders and most favorably position mhe for longterm success 

as such on november 26 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell mhe to investment funds affiliated with apollo global management llc for a purchase price of 25 billion subject to certain closing adjustments as part of this transaction mcgrawhill will receive 250 million in senior unsecured notes issued by the purchaser at an annual interest rate of 85 we are currently in the process of determining the fair value of these notes for all periods presented in this form 10k the results of operations of mhe have been reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the business have been reclassified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets the sale of mhe is subject to various closing conditions and is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2013 unless otherwise indicated all disclosures and amounts in the mda relate to our continuing operations see item 1a  risk factors in this form 10k for updates to certain risk factors related to the sale

key results 



 

sp ratings  –   revenue and operating profit increased 15  and 18  respectively revenue growth was driven by strong highyield and investment grade corporate bond issuance related to robust refinancing activity and increases in bank loan ratings and structured finance the increase was also impacted by increases in public finance driven by strong municipal bond issuance in the united states operating profit increased compared to 2011  primarily due to the increases in revenue partially offset by higher incentive costs due to improved financial performance an increase in legal expenses restructuring charges of 15 million in the second half of 2012 and unfavorable foreign exchange rates

and associates jdpa primarily in asia and the united states and a strong focus on the management of expenses across the brands partially offsetting the growth in the segment were additional costs related to revenue growth incentive costs at platts and jdpa and restructuring charges of 12 million recorded in the second half of 2012 

sp ratings  –   revenue increased 4  and operating profit declined 6  revenue growth was driven by an increase in nontransaction revenues due to growth in nonissuance related revenue at corporate ratings and increases at crisil our majority owned indian credit rating agency partially offset by declines in structured finance the decline in operating profit was driven by an increase in expenses resulting from staff increases and incremental compliance and regulatory costs as well as a decline in transaction revenue

depreciation and amortization increased 15 million  or 15  as compared to 2010 primarily due to additional intangible asset amortization related to our recent acquisitions 

other income   

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded a pretax gain of 52 million within other income in the consolidated statement of income related to a change in our vacation policy the change in our vacation policy modified the number of days that employees are entitled to for unused vacation time upon termination of employment as they will only be paid for vacation days equivalent to what they have earned in the current year 

during 2011 we recorded a pretax gain of 13 million within other income in the consolidated statement of income which related to the sale of our interest in linkedin corporation in their initial public offering this investment was held within our cc segment 

during 2010 we recorded a pretax gain of 7 million within other income in the consolidated statement of income which related to the sale of certain equity interests in india which were part of our sp ratings segment 

operating profit 

we consider operating profit to be an important measure for evaluating our operating performance and we define operating profit as revenues less the related cost of producing the revenues and selling and general expenses we also further evaluate operating profit for each of the reportable business segments in which we operate 

we internally manage our operations by reference to “segment operating profit” and resources are allocated primarily based on segment operating profit segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before allocated expenses which are centrally managed costs and do not affect the operating results of our segments segment operating profit is one of the key metrics we use to evaluate operating performance segment operating profit is not however a measure of financial performance under us gaap and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 



 

segment operating profit – increased 214 million  or 16  as compared to 2011  segment operating income margins were 34  and 33  for 2012  and 2011  respectively restructuring charges and other nonrecurring charges as noted above mitigated the margin improvement for the period see “segment review” below for further information in addition segment operating profit benefited from reduced pension costs as we froze our us employee retirement plan effective on april 1 2012 

unallocated expense  – increased by 80 million  or 36  as compared to 2011  mainly as a result of 156 million of growth and value plan related costs necessary to enable separation and reduce our cost structure which includes professional fees of 117 million and restructuring charges of 21 million this was partially offset by a vacation accrual reversal of 52 million unallocated expenses also includes an increase for costs that were previously allocated to mhe such as costs for centralized departments that could not be classified as discontinued operations due to the nature of the expense 

foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 6 million on operating profit for 2012  this impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between currentyear and prioryear foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business functional currency 

  

segment operating profit – increased  73 million  or 6  as compared to 2010 segment operating income margins were and 33   34  for 2011 and 2010 respectively restructuring charges as noted above mitigated the margin improvement for the period see “segment review” below for further information 

unallocated expense  – increased by 22 million  or 11  as compared to 2010 mainly as a result of 27 million of growth and value plan related costs necessary to enable separation and reduce our cost structure which includes restructuring charges of 17 million and professional fees of 10 million 

foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 13 million on operating profit for 2011 

interest expense net 

net interest expense increased 4  as compared to 2011  primarily due to increased interest expense related to uncertain tax positions as well as lower international interest income from our investments in 2012  compared with 2011  net interest expense decreased 7 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher international interest income from our investments in 2011 compared with 2010 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 358 374 and 364 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the reduction in the effective tax rate from the prior year periods was primarily due to the partnership structure of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture the growth and value plan and restructuring costs incurred primarily in the united states including discontinued operations the effective tax rate was 458 365 and 364 for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the increase in the effective tax rate including discontinued operations for 2012 was due to the goodwill impairment recorded at mhe 

absent any impact of factors including intervening audit settlements changes in federal state or foreign law and changes in the geographical mix of our income we expect our 2013 effective tax rate to decrease from our 2012 effective tax rate due to the full year effect of the sp dow jones indices llc joint venture 

loss income from discontinued operations 

loss from discontinued operations was 234 million in 2012 as compared to income from discontinued operations of 308 million in 2011 primarily as a result of revenue declines and several nonrecurring items 

revenue at mhe decreased 230 million or 10 as compared to 2011 primarily due to decreases in the adoption states as well as open territory sales at school education group also contributing to the reduction was a substantial increase in deferred revenue due to higher sales of programs that contain digital components that will be delivered over multiple years in the higher education professional and international group sales of new editions have been impacted by the growth of the used book and rental market however digital sales across mhe continue to increase as compared to 2011 

nonrecurring items impacting the loss from discontinued operations included 

 

income from discontinued operations increased 22  primarily due to a gain of 74 million net of tax related to the sale of our broadcasting group completed on december 30 2011 excluding the gain income from discontinued operations decreased 7 compared to 2010 as a result of revenue declines and restructuring charges at mhe of 34 million consisting primarily of employee severance costs revenue at mhe decreased 141 million or 6 as compared to 2010 primarily due to decreases in the adoption states as well as open territory sales at seg 

segment review 

sp ratings 

credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments they are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer such as a corporation or state or city government to meet its financial obligations in full and on time our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue such as a corporate or municipal bond and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default 

sp ratings differentiates its revenue between transaction and nontransaction transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with 

 

nontransaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating annual fees for customer relationshipbased pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings 



  

revenue 

transaction revenue grew significantly as compared to 2011 driven by strong highyield and investment grade corporate bond issuance related to robust refinancing activity borrowers took advantage of low rates replacing existing bonds with cheaper debt particularly in the second half of 2012 as issuers refinanced in advance of the uncertainty surrounding the us fiscal cliff and presidential election the significant increase was also attributable to weak results in the second half of 2011 resulting from the impacts of the sovereign crisis in europe and a slow economic recovery additionally increases in 2012 in public finance contributed to growth in transaction revenue primarily from strong municipal bond issuance in the us as refunding activity increased dramatically over 2011 strong growth in bank loan ratings resulting from a favorable interest rate environment was also a key driver contributing to the growth in structured finance revenues specifically an increase to us collateralized loan obligations clo transaction revenue us asset backed securities abs transaction revenue also increased due to favorable spreads expansion of both bank  nonbank issuance and solid refinancing activity of student loans 

nontransaction revenue remained relatively flat as growth in nonissuance related revenue at corporate ratings primarily for entity credit ratings and rating evaluation services was offset by declines in annual fees and program fees in structured finance annual fees include surveillance fees and other customer relationshipbased fees additionally crisils acquisition of coalition development ltd in july of 2012 had a favorable impact on nontransaction revenue in 2012 nontransaction revenue includes an intersegment royalty charged to sp capital iq for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by sp ratings royalty revenue for 2012  and 2011 was 69 million  and 63 million  respectively 

foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of 37 million on revenue for 2012 

revenue increased compared to 2010 as nontransaction revenue growth offset the slight decline in transaction revenue nontransaction revenue includes an intersegment royalty charged to sp capital iq for the rights to use and distribute content and 

data developed by sp ratings royalty revenue for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was 63 million and 56 million respectively foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 25 million on revenue for 2011 

the decrease in transaction revenue was driven primarily by declines in public finance and structured finance these declines were partially offset by increases at corporate ratings due to growth in bank loan ratings and highyield corporate bond ratings revenue us municipal bond issuance decreased as municipal market volume declined driven by the expiration of the build america bond program at the end of 2010 declines in structured finance were driven by lower issuance volumes in the us of residential mortgagebacked securities “rmbs” collateralized debt obligations “cdo” and abs 

revenue derived from nontransaction related sources increased compared to 2010 primarily as a result of growth in nonissuance related revenue at corporate ratings primarily for entity credit ratings ratings evaluation services and surveillance fees and crisil our majority owned indian credit rating agency primarily for outsourcing services and the acquisition of pipal research in december 2010 this was partially offset by declines in structured finance related to lower annual fees that were adversely impacted by increased deal maturities and defaults primarily on cdo deals nontransaction revenue represented a larger percentage of total sp ratings revenue for 2011 compared to 2010 as transaction revenue decreased and nontransaction revenue increased in 2011 due to the factors discussed above 

operating profit 

operating profit increased compared to 2011 primarily due to the increases in revenue as noted above these increases were partially offset by increased expenses resulting from higher incentive costs due to improved financial performance an increase in legal expenses restructuring charges of 15 million in the second half of 2012 consisting of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 100 positions crisils acquisition of coalition development ltd in july of 2012 and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 13 million 

operating profit decreased compared to 2010 due to increased expenses resulting from staff increases incremental compliance and regulatory costs restructuring charges of 9 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 consisting of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 30 positions and a decline in transaction revenue partially offset by growth in nontransaction revenue as noted above and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 12 million 

issuance volumes 

we monitor issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within sp ratings issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer issuance volumes can be reported in two ways by “domicile” which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located or based on “marketplace” which is where the bonds are sold the following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on thomson financial harrison scott publications dealogic and sp rating’s internal estimates

industry highlights and outlook 

strong highyield and investment grade issuance in 2012 was driven by robust refinancing activity as borrowers took advantage of low rates replacing existing bonds with cheaper debt during the second half issuance was driven by issuers refinancing in advance of the uncertainty surrounding the us fiscal cliff and presidential election in 2013 opportunistic issuance is expected to continue at a slightly slower pace as many refinancings were completed in 2012 however we believe the longer term outlook for the corporate bond market continues to be healthy 

structured finance issuance in the us continued its turnaround throughout 2012 and 2013 looks to build on this momentum the us rmbs market is expected to remain modest given continuing home pricing pressures historically low mortgage origination levels and continued high unemployment nationally european rmbs issuance volumes continued to remain low during 2012 and we expect the bank of englands funding for lending scheme will continue to dampen european rmbs issuance in 2013 us cmbs issuance experienced growth particularly in the fourth quarter due to improving economic conditions low interest rates stabilizing delinquency rates and narrowing spreads healthier us cmbs issuance levels are expected to continue in 2013 

the us cdo market experienced strong clo activity in 2012 we expect this activity to remain strong as we move into 2013 us abs issuance volume in 2012 was robust with strength in autos leading the way as vehicle sales have increased and the outlook for 2013 remains strong european abs issuance volume experienced strong growth in autos and credit cards in the fourth quarter of 2012 these trends are also expected to continue in 2013 

legal and regulatory environment 

the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the us and abroad the businesses conducted by our sp ratings segment are in certain cases regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 the us securities exchange act of 1934 andor the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business 

standard  poor’s ratings services is a credit rating agency that is registered with the sec as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro” the sec first began designating nrsros in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the sec’s net capital rule 

the “credit rating agency reform act of 2006” the “act” created a new sec registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as nrsros under the act the sec is given authority and oversight of nrsros and can censure nrsros revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases the rules implemented by the sec pursuant to the act address among other things prevention or misuse of material nonpublic information conflicts of interest and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies the public portions of the current version of sp ratings’s form nrsro are available on sp rating’s web site 

outside the us regulators and government officials have been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies sp ratings is subject to regulations in several foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally including the international organization of securities commissions the european securities and markets authority and others to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements sp ratings expects regulators in additional countries to introduce new regulations in the future 

we have reviewed the new laws regulations and rules which have been adopted and have implemented or are planning to implement changes as required we do not believe that such new laws regulations or rules will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations other laws regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local national foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies the impact on us of the adoption of any such laws regulations or rules remains uncertain but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to sp rating’s rating activities

in the normal course of business both in the us and abroad the company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are involved from time to time in governmental and selfregulatory agency proceedings which may result in adverse judgments damages fines or penalties also various governmental and selfregulatory agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning compliance with applicable laws and regulations

revenue 

revenue grew compared to 2011 primarily due to growth at capital iq global data solutions and the recent acquisitions of r² technologies quanthouse and cma 

the increase at capital iq was driven by market share gains and increased contract values for existing accounts however headcount reductions in the financial services industry have tempered growth the number of clients have still increased 7 from 2011 and the spend from the top accounts continues to grow the client increase includes a certain percentage of clients on themarketscom platform that have been migrated to the capital iq platform the subscription base for the global credit portal increased slightly as difficult market conditions due to budget constraints and reductions in headcount across the customer base affected revenue in 2012 clients continue to reduce staff levels to manage their spending levels and layoffs have continued to be announced through the fourth quarter of 2012 

the subscription base for global data solutions is growing from new client relationships and expanded relationships into existing accounts as the number of ratingsxpress® customers have increased 10 in 2012 as compared to 2011 however average contract values for those customers have declined due to customer budget constraints amidst difficult market conditions client cancellations have also been higher than in the prior year due to increased merger and acquisition activity during the year that caused those clients to reevaluate their subscriptions 

traditionally revenue has been primarily domestic however due to increases in europe for the subscription base for ratingsxpress® continued sales efforts of the capital iq desktop in europe and asia and recent acquisitions in europe international growth continued to occur throughout 2012 

revenue grew compared to 2010 primarily due to platform enhancements resulting in market share gains and increased contract values for existing accounts at capital iq the acquisition of themarketscom in september 2010 and growth in the subscription base both in new clients and in further expanding the existing customer base for the global credit portal which includes ratingsdirect® global data solutions also contributed to the increase driven primarily by growth in the subscription base from new client relationships and expanded relationships into existing accounts 

capital iq continued to have significant client growth as the number of clients increased 14 in 2011 as compared to 2010 traditionally subscription revenue has been primarily domestic however due to the continued enhancements of the capital iq international database strong sales for the global credit portal and ratingsxpress® particularly in europe doubledigit international growth occurred in 2011 

operating profit 

operating profit decreased slightly as compared to 2011 2012 was significantly impacted by restructuring charges of 19 million recorded in the second half of 2012 consisting of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 150 positions the 2012 acquisitions also contributed to the decrease particularly due to amortization charges relating to the intangible assets also impacting operating profit were staff increases primarily in developing regions increased technology costs to support 

the growth in the employee base and costs to further develop our content and software these decreases were partially offset by the increase in revenue discussed above and a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 7 million 

operating profit increased compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in the subscription base for the global credit portal and global data solutions and strong results in our cusip business in addition growth at capital iq and the acquisition of themarketscom contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by higher personnel costs and staff increases internationally mainly in india and additional costs to build out our integrated data feed within global data solutions and costs to further develop our infrastructure 

industry highlights and outlook 

the segment is focused on integrating and evolving its assets and capabilities into one scaled business that offers unique highvalue offerings across all asset classes sp capital iq made significant progress in building new functionality filling critical capability gaps to bolster their foundation for future growth specific strategic acquisitions included 

 

as a result of our focus on integration and these acquisitions demand is expected to continue to increase for our capital iq and data and information offerings enhancements to the segments content and platforms will be a key focus in 2013 in addition growing the client base will be another important area of focus as the segment increases the integration of their services on their delivery platforms specifically ratingsdirect® on the capital iq platform and the delivery of ratingsxpress® and continues to bring new analytic and data solutions to the marketplace they expect additional customer growth to occur 

legal and regulatory environment

the markets for financial research investment and advisory services are very competitive sp capital iq competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of its research and advisory services client service reputation price geographic scope range of products and services and technological innovation 

on november 17 2009 the european commission directorategeneral for competition “ec” sent a statement of objections “so” to the company outlining the ec’s preliminary view that standard  poor’s cusip service bureau an sp rating’s brand that is part of sp capital iq was abusing its position as the soleappointed national numbering agency for us securities by requiring financial institutions and information service providers to pay licensing fees for the use of international securities identification numbers as set forth in the so the ec’s preliminary view was that this behavior amounted to unfair pricing and infringed european competition law the company believed these preliminary views were erroneous but in order to resolve the investigation proposed a set of commitments to the ec following market testing of the commitments further discussions between the parties and some limited modifications to the commitments the ec on november 15 2011 accepted and made those commitments legally binding and ended its investigation pursuant to the commitments cusip global services will create and distribute a new data feed of us international securities identification numbers tailored specifically to the institutions for their use within the european economic area within five months

cc consists of businesstobusiness companies specializing in the commodities and commercial markets that deliver their customers access to highvalue information data analytic services and pricing benchmarks cc includes such brands as platts jdpa mcgrawhill construction and aviation week  the broadcasting group had historically been part of cc as of december 30 2011 we completed the sale of the broadcasting group and in accordance with the presentation of the broadcasting group as discontinued operations the results of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 and prior periods presented have been reclassified to reflect this change see note 2 – growth and value plan  discontinued operations  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

the cc business is driven by the need for highvalue information and transparency in a variety of industries our commodities business serves producers traders and intermediaries within energy metals and agriculture markets our commercial business serves professionals and executives within automotive construction aerospace and defense and marketing  research services markets cc delivers premier content that is deeply embedded in customer workflows and decision making processes 

commodities revenue is generated primarily through the following sources 

 

commercial revenue is generated primarily from digital and print subscriptions for a variety of products proprietary research and consulting ad claims and industry conferences   



revenue 

revenue at cc increased primarily due to continued demand for platts’ proprietary content and by growth across our automotive sectors at jdpa primarily in asia and the united states 

platts’ revenue grew by 17 and represents 50 of total cc revenue with growth across all regions this growth was mainly driven by strength in platts’ market data and price assessment products across all commodity sectors led by petroleum and natural gas while petroleum is still the biggest driver the revenue mix is becoming more diversified as metals and global trading services have shown strong growth year over year excluding recent acquisitions annualized contract values for platts top 250 customers have increased 13 as compared to 2011 and those customers represent approximately 67 of platts total annualized contract value the two strategic acquisitions in 2011 bentek energy llc in january and steel business briefing group in july also contributed to the increase in revenue at platts all commodity sectors have also shown very strong renewal rates for subscription products during the year 

jdpa had revenue growth across their global automotive sectors including automotive consulting and their power information network® pin pin provides realtime automotive information and decisionsupport tools based on the collection and analysis of daily new and usedvehicle retail transaction data from thousands of automotive franchises growth occurred across the majority of regions most notably china and japan international growth was 14 and represents 37 of the total revenue also contributing to the increase at jdpa was an increase in their roundtables and events as well as licensing revenue associated with syndicated studies 

partially offsetting these increases at cc were declines in mcgrawhill construction as market contraction declines have continued to impact revenue however growth related to new products and enhancements is gaining traction 

revenue increased primarily by strong demand for platts’ proprietary content and by growth in syndicated studies and consulting services across automotive and nonautomotive sectors foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 4 million on revenue 

platts’ revenue grew by more than 21 and represents nearly 47 of total cc revenue for the year platts’ global commodities products primarily related to petroleum and natural gas have shown strong growth as continued volatility in commodity prices drove the need for market information the spread between the highest and lowest price for crude oil futures during 2011 was approximately 63 greater than the spread in 2010 the growth rate in international revenue across the commodities products was strong across all regions particularly in asia and europe 

international growth for automotive revenue was strong in 2011 across all regions also contributing to revenue growth for 2011 was the final transitioning during 2010 of certain automotive syndicated studies to an online service platform this resulted in revenue that was deferred in 2010 to be recognized in 2011 

partially offsetting these increases at cc were decreases in the construction business as market weakness has continued to impact revenue although the rate of decline is moderating 

operating profit 

operating profit increased primarily due to the revenue growth described above and a strong focus on the management of expenses across the brands the nonrecurring items that impacted operating profit in the prior year also contributed to the increase in 2012 offsetting the increase were additional costs primarily related to revenue growth additional incentive costs at platts and jdpa and restructuring charges of 12 million that were recorded in the second half of 2012 consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 110 positions 

the key drivers for operating profit growth in the segment for 2011 were the revenue growth mentioned above along with lower compensation costs as a result of restructuring actions restructuring charges of 6 million were recorded in the fourth quarter consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 100 positions additional costs from our acquisition of bentek energy llc and steel business briefing group partially offset the growth in the segment also impacting operating profit were a number of nonrecurring items consisting of a writeoff of deferred costs recorded in prior periods offset by a gain on the sale of our interest in linkedin corporation as discussed in more detail in note 3 – acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements and insurance recoveries on costs incurred in prior periods 

industry highlights and outlook 

cc expects to continue to invest in digital capabilities that will enable our brands to become more integrated compete more effectively in the marketplace and create a foundation for the development of new products and revenue streams the segment expects to further expand its presence in selected markets and geographies to help drive growth 

the continuing growth in oil demand and the uncertainty of supply causes volatility in energy prices which will drive market participant demand for platts proprietary content including news price assessments and analytics the international energy agency projects that world oil consumption will rise to 908 million barrels per day a gain of 09 million barrels per day compared to 2012 in 2013 platts will continue to invest in technology and customer engagement activities to drive additional revenue growth across all commodity sectors they will also continue to leverage the capabilities and content from recent acquisitions and expend into adjacent markets similar to 2012 they will continue to introduce a number of new products and price assessments within all commodity sectors platts will also continue to ensure readiness for adherence to the international organization of securities commissions iosco principles and while the principles focus on oil platts is ensuring that processes related to all commodities are in adherence with the principles 

demand for our automotive studies is driven by the performance of the automotive industry in 2012 global and us light vehicle sales increased approximately 5 and 13 respectively compared to 2011 with growth across all major markets except europe for 2013 jdpa projects growth for global and us light vehicles sales of 3 and 4 respectively in 2013 jdpa will strive to grow the core business by strengthening their benchmark studies leveraging new initiatives to drive operational efficiencies and enhance customer delivery and increasing the distribution of their syndicated studies international growth will also be a key focus as they will look to extend their product offerings by expanding their pin business to china and brazil 

demand for our construction offerings is primarily dependent on the nonresidential construction industry nonresidential building construction in 2012 was down 9 from a year ago due to 12 decline for the institutional side and a 33 decline for manufacturing facilities residential building climbed 29 compared to 2011 nonbuilding construction in 2012 increased 2 from prior year as a 9 increase in electric utilities offset a 1 decline in public works in 2013 total construction starts are forecast to rise 7 with residential building up 24 and the commercial building sector up 14 mcgrawhill construction will continue to focus on expense management in 2013 and new business growth should begin to outweigh the historical loss of certain strategic accounts 

legal and regulatory environment 

our commodities business is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the us and abroad on october 5 2012 iosco issued its final report to the g20 including principles for oil price reporting agencies which sets out principles iosco states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members on january 9 2013 iosco held a meeting with the price reporting organizations to discuss implementation of the principles for oil price reporting agencies at the meeting platts was able to obtain clarification from iosco on its expectations for voluntary implementation of the principles by platts and the other pros and with that clarification platts believes that the principles will not have a significant negative impact on its ongoing business operations

in 2012 we generated free cash flow of 626 million  versus 809 million  in 2011 a decrease of  183 million  the decline is primarily due to onetime costs related to the growth and value plan and a 150 million fourth quarter pension contribution free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects see “reconciliation of nongaap financial information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased  177 million  to  747 million  in 2012 mainly due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of higher billings at sp ratings sp indices and sp capital iq in 2012 compared to 2011 and higher pension plan contributions in 2012 partially offset by higher income taxes payable as the irs extended the due date for the fourth quarter estimated income tax payment until the first quarter of 2013 and higher payments to vendors in 2011 

cash provided by operating activities increased  220 million  to  924 million  in 2011 mainly due to higher pension plan contributions in 2010 an increase in accounts receivable in 2010 due to higher billings in 2010 compared to 2009 and a tax refund in 2011 that did not occur in 2010 partially offset by increased payments to vendors higher payments for incentives and higher legal and thirdparty consulting payments in 2011 higher incentive compensation payments in 2011 reflect greater achievement against targeted results in 2010 as compared to achievement against targets in 2009 

investing activities 

our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures while cash inflows are primarily from dispositions 

cash used for investing activities decreased  24 million  to  247 million  for 2012 primarily due to a higher amount of cash inflows from shortterm investments and a lower amount of cash paid for acquisitions partially offset by lower proceeds from dispositions due to the sale of our interest in linkedin corporation in 2011 

cash used for investing activities decreased  115 million  to  271 million  in 2011 primarily due to higher amount of cash paid for acquisitions in 2010 

refer to note 3 – acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

financing activities 

our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases dividends and repayment of debt while cash inflows are primarily inflows from commercial paper borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

cash used for financing activities decreased  755 million  to  905 million  in 2012 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases partially offset by an increase in dividend paid to shareholders due to a special dividend payment in 2012 

cash used for financing activities increased  1130 million  to  1660 million  in 2011 the increase is primarily attributable to cash used to repurchase shares 

during 2012 we used cash to repurchase 68 million shares for 295 million including commissions the average price per share excluding commissions was 5035 during 2011 we utilized cash to repurchase 347 million shares for 15 billion including commissions the average price per share excluding commissions was 4048 the average prices per share for 2012 and 2011 does not include the accelerated share repurchase transactions as discussed in more detail in note 9 – equity to our consolidated financial statements we repurchased 87 million shares for 256 million including commissions during 2010 the average price per share excluding commissions was 2937 the repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options 

on june 29 2011 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares the “2011 repurchase program” which was approximately 17 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time the 2011 repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions depending on market conditions as of december 31 2012 169 million shares remained available under the 2011 repurchase program 

discontinued operations 

cash flows from discontinued operations reflects the classification of mhe and the broadcasting group as discontinued operations as discussed in note 2 – growth and value plan  discontinued operations  

cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations increased 100 million to 520 million in 2012 and decreased 333 million to 420 million in 2011 the increase in 2012 is primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivables as a result of lower sales year over year at mhe higher unearned revenue at seg and lower inventory purchases the decrease in 2011 is primarily due to lower operating results higher extended payment terms provided on a specific state adoption in the fourth quarter of 2011 and slower cash collections accelerated payments to vendors and lower incentive compensation based on lower performance 

cash used for provided by investing activities from discontinued operations decreased 223 million to 198 million in 2012 and increased 237 million to 25 million in 2011 primarily due to proceeds of 216 million received for the sale of the broadcasting group in 2011 

cash used for financing activities increased 8 million to 12 million in 2012 and 2011 was comparable with 2010 

additional financing 

we have the ability to borrow a total of 12 billion through our commercial paper program which is supported by our 12 billion threeyear credit agreement our “credit facility” that will terminate on july 30 2013 we pay a commitment fee of 15 to 35 basis points for our credit facility depending on our credit rating whether or not amounts have been borrowed and currently pay a commitment fee of 20 basis points the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is at our option calculated using rates 

that are primarily based on either the prevailing london interbank offer rate the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate for certain borrowings under our credit facility there is also a spread based on our credit rating added to the applicable rate 

in connection with the special dividend in the amount of 250 per share on our common stock we utilized our commercial paper program in december of 2012 and as a result commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of december 31 2012 totaled 457 million  with an average interest rate and term of 048 and 28 days as of december 31 2012 we can borrow 743 million in additional funds through the commercial paper program there were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings as of december 31 2011 

our credit facility contains certain covenants the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility is not greater than 4 to 1 and this covenant has never been exceeded 

on february 7 2013 fitch ratings downgraded our credit rating to bbb from a and placed our ratings on rating watch negative on february 14 2013 moodys investors service downgraded our credit rating from a3 to baa2 with negative outlook there has been no change to our shortterm  commercial paper ratings of f2 from fitch ratings and p2 from moodys investors service 

dividends 

on january 30 2013 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from 0255 per share to 028 per share 

on december 6 2012 our board of directors approved a special dividend in the amount of 250 per share on our common stock payable on december 27 2012 to shareholders on record on december 18 2012 

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to contracts for informationtechnology outsourcing certain enterprisewide informationtechnology software licensing and maintenance and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2013 

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2012 over the next several years that relate to our continuing operations additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table   



 

as of december 31 2012 we had 74 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2012 we contributed 193 million and 12 million to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively expected employer contributions in 2013 are 30 million and 12 million for our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2013 we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 7 – employee benefits  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

reconciliation of nongaap financial information 

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends and other payments paid to noncontrolling interests are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt make strategic acquisitions and investments repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs 

the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow 



critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities unless otherwise indicated all discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations relate to our continuing operations 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized as it is earned when goods are shipped to customers or services are rendered we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable we make our best estimate of the services’ stand alone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately in such cases we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period 

for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2013 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 10 million 

for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2013 

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets there were no material impairments of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 21 billion and 13 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our 4 reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price if 

based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test for 2012 based on our qualitative assessments with the exception of impairments in our seg reporting unit previously discussed under the heading “ discontinued operations”  we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived asset is impaired a quantitative impairment test is performed if necessary the impairment test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at our sp ratings sp capital iq sp dj indices and cc operating segments and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

 

our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 



stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operatingrelated expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted in 2012 stock options were not granted as part of employees total stockbased incentive awards 



because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2013 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable on the basis of present information it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within those foreign operations accordingly we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution 

by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability which may be material to our future reported results financial position and cash flows 

for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes however certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter 

redeemable noncontrolling interest 

the fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in sp dj indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available including assumptions related to expected future net cash flows longterm growth rates the timing and nature of tax attributes and the redemption features 

recent   accounting standards 

see note 1 – accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards we do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or liquidity in future periods 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

there have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the year ended december 31 2012 our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities as of december 31 2012 we have entered into an immaterial amount of foreign exchange forwards to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

 item 1 business 

overview 

the mcgrawhill companies inc together with its consolidated subsidiaries the “company” the “registrant” “we” “us” or “our” is a leading global information services provider serving the financial education commercial and commodities markets with the information they need to succeed in the “knowledge economy” we serve our global customers through a broad range of products services and distribution channels including digital data and information integrated digital platforms online via internet websites as well as with printed books magazines and newsletters and conferences and trade shows 

on september 12 2011 we announced that our board of directors unanimously approved a comprehensive growth and value plan as the culmination of a portfolio review begun in late 2010 one of the primary features of this plan is the separation of the enterprise into two public companies mcgrawhill financial focused on content and analytics for financial markets and mcgrawhill education focused on education services and digital learning on december 7 2011 management provided an update on our growth and value plan discussing new actions that will facilitate the separation into two independent companies highlighted actions included 

 

  

  

  

 further information regarding these actions can be found in our notes to the consolidated financial statements under item 8 consolidated financial statements and supplementary data  in this report 

we expect to complete the separation by the end of 2012 through a taxfree spinoff of the education business to the company’s shareholders subject to various conditions and regulatory approvals including final board approval and a tax ruling from the internal revenue service 

furthermore on october 3 2011 we entered into a definitive agreement with the ew scripps company to sell the broadcasting group the sale was completed on december 30 2011 when we received net proceeds of approximately 216 million the divestiture of our broadcasting group previously included in our commodities  commercial segment previously named the mcgrawhill information  media segment was carried out pursuant to our growth and value plan discussed in further detail below as a result of the sale the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the broadcasting group as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the business have been removed from the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 and reclassified as held for sale as of december 31 2010 

our businesses 

we have four operating segments which have historically been named standard  poor’s “sp” mcgrawhill financial mcgrawhill information  media and mcgrawhill education “mhe” as part of our growth and value plan we have changed the names of our four operating segments to align with how we plan on referring to the businesses going forward sp has changed to sp ratings mcgrawhill financial has been changed to sp capital iq  sp indices mcgrawhill information  media has changed to commodities  commercial “cc” and mhe has remained the same going forward the new mcgrawhill financial will include sp ratings sp capital iq  sp indices and cc 

sp ratings 

sp ratings is the worlds foremost provider of credit ratings credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments they are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer such as a corporation or state or city government to meet its financial obligations in full and on time our credit ratings can also speak to the credit quality of an individual debt issue such as a corporate or municipal bond and the relative likelihood that the issue may default 

with offices in over 20 countries around the world sp ratings is an important part of the worlds financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions and access to the financial markets the key constituents sp ratings serves are investors corporations governments municipalities commercial and investment banks insurance companies asset managers and other debt issuers 

  

sp ratings differentiates its revenue between transactional and nontransactional transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with 

 

  

  

 nontransaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating annual fees for customer relationshipbased pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings

mcgrawhill education 

mhe is one of the premier global educational publishers and consists of two operating groups the school education group “seg” serving the elementary and high school “elhi” markets and the higher education professional and international group “hpi” serving the college and university professional international and adult education markets as world economies become increasingly centered on the service sector and technology and as the global population continues to rise education is more than ever the key to growth 

the elhi market is changing with digital capabilities becoming increasingly critical seg sells textbooks and supplemental materials in print digital and hybrid versions and provides online and traditional assessment and reporting services the key markets are prekindergarten elementary secondary testing supplemental vocational and postsecondary fields in the united states the market for textbooks consists of adoption states which are states that provide educational funding to school districts for specific programs based on adoption calendars and open territory states which are states that do not follow adoption calendars this market is influenced strongly by the size and timing of state adoption opportunities and the availability of funds in adoption states and in the open territory federal support has eased some of the pressure on state and local finances which has helped to mitigate the cutbacks in k12 education 

in the college and university market and the international market we sell integrated digital elearning platforms textbooks and other instructional resources for the broad range of higher education disciplines key markets for higher education products are domestic and international colleges universities postgraduate institutions and english as a second language esl programs for the professional market both in the united states and internationally we offer digital and print products in medicine healthcare engineering science computer technology business education and general reference

 continuing costreduction initiatives 

we have made significant progress in 2011 towards our cost reduction goals to ensure that we will have appropriate cost structures to drive margin expansion and invest selectively in attractive growth opportunities we reduced cc’s workforce by approximately 100 positions and standard  poor’s workforce by approximately 30 positions in 2011 we will continue to look to extend outsourcing efforts to enhance cost synergies and realign administrative support for a leaner overall cost structure 

mcgrawhill education

optimize resource allocation for longterm value 

we will continue to optimize resource allocation to create longterm value this means deploying capital as appropriate to support our growth strategy developing an integrated and focused organizational structure and rationalizing the cost structure to enhance efficiency we reduced mcgrawhill education’s workforce by approximately 540 positions in 2011 to create a flatter more agile organization we will continue to reduce costs and streamline mcgrawhill education’s operational structure which will enable it to aggressively pursue a strategy that focuses on highgrowth opportunities in digital learning and education services

 certain of the statements below are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 in addition any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty see forwardlooking statements on page 2 of this report 

overview 

we are a leading global information services provider serving the financial services education commercial and commodities markets with the information they need to succeed in the “knowledge economy” the commercial markets include automotive construction aerospace and defense and marketingresearch information services while the commodities market includes energy 

our operations consist of four operating segments which have historically been named standard  poor’s “sp” mcgrawhill financial mcgrawhill information  media and mcgrawhill education “mhe” as part of our growth and value plan we have changed the names of our four operating segments to align with how we plan on referring to the businesses going forward sp has changed to sp ratings mcgrawhill financial has been changed to sp capital iq  sp indices mcgrawhill information  media has changed to commodities  commercial “cc” and mhe has remained the same going forward the new mcgrawhill financial will include sp ratings sp capital iq  sp indices and cc 

 

  

  

  

 on october 3 2011 we entered into a definitive agreement with the ew scripps company to sell the broadcasting group the sale was completed on december 30 2011 when we received net proceeds of approximately 216 million the divestiture of our broadcasting group previously included in our cc segment was carried out pursuant to our growth and value plan discussed in further detail below as a result of the sale the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the broadcasting group as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the business have been removed from the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2011 and reclassified as held for sale as of december 31 2010 

on september 12 2011 we announced that our board of directors unanimously approved a comprehensive growth and value plan that includes separation into two public companies mcgrawhill financial focused on content and analytics for financial markets and mcgrawhill education focused on education services and digital learning on december 7 2011 management provided an update on our growth and value plan discussing new actions that will facilitate the separation into two independent companies highlighted actions included 

 

  

   

  

 we expect to complete the separation by the end of 2012 through a taxfree spinoff of the education business to the company’s shareholders subject to various conditions and regulatory approvals including final board approval and a tax ruling from the internal revenue service professional fees associated with the growth and value plan recorded during the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately 10 million 

key results for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

 

 as the customers of our businesses vary we manage and assess the performance of our business based on the performance of our segments and use operating income as a key measure based on this approach and the nature of our operations the discussion of results generally focuses around our four business segments and their related operating groups versus distinguishing between products and services 

revenue increased at our sp ratings sp capital iq  sp indices and cc segments and declined at our mhe segment operating income improved at our sp capital iq  sp indices and cc segments and declined at our sp ratings and mhe segments 

 

  

  

  

 2010 

revenue increased at our sp ratings sp capital iq  sp indices and mhe segments and declined at our cc segment operating income improved at all four of our segments 

 

  

  

   

 outlook 

as discussed above on september 12 2011 we announced our growth and value plan that includes separation into two public companies mcgrawhill financial and mcgrawhill education this transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2012 

four key trends are increasing the need for content and analytics in the financial commercial and commodities markets

 further projections and discussion on our 2012 outlook for our segments can be found within “results of operations” 

  

results of operations 

consolidated review 

 

 product revenue and expenses consist of educational and information products primarily books magazine circulations and syndicated study programs in our mhe and cc segments service revenue and expenses consist of our sp ratings and sp capital iq  sp indices segments service assessment contracts in our mhe segment and informationrelated services and advertising in our cc segment 

revenue 

product revenue decreased primarily due to decreases at mhe for both adoption and open territory state sales decreases at international education from lower sales in asia europe and the middle east and africa and decreases in book sales at professional partially offset by growth in higher education for both print and digital products service revenue increased primarily due to growth in our global commodities products growth at capital iq revenue from themarketscom acquired in september 2010 nontransaction revenue growth at crisil an increase in our corporate industrial ratings and higher sales of our exchangetraded fund products this was partially offset by a decline in our construction business public finance structured finance and investment research products 

product revenue increased primarily due to increases at mhe for both print and digital product in higher education and for adoption state sales this was partially offset by lower open territory sales service revenue increased primarily due to growth in transaction revenues driven by highyield corporate bond issuance growth in our global commodities information products index services creditratings related information products such as ratingsxpress and ratingsdirect and capital iq this was partially offset by declines in custom testing revenue at mhe due to the discontinuation of contracts and declines at sp capital iq  sp indices in investment research services and structured finance the divestiture of businessweek at cc impacted both product and service revenue 

expenses 

product operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in plant amortization lower reserve requirements tight overall cost controls and lower manufacturing and direct expenses given the reduced revenue opportunities at mhe this was partially offset by increased costs at mhe as a result of technology requirements and the continuing investment in digital product development service operating expenses increased primarily as a result of increased personnel costs and additional costs to further develop infrastructure selling and general expenses increased primarily due to a fourth quarter restructuring plan we initiated across the company as part of our growth and value plan higher costs associated with increased sales higher compensation and incremental compliance and regulatory costs primarily in our sp ratings segment 

net interest expense decreased primarily due to higher international interest income from our investments 

  

2010 

product operating expenses decreased due to reduced prepublication amortization and lower costs related to inventory at mhe as well as overall costsaving initiatives service operating expenses increased slightly primarily due to increased compensation expense partially offset by the divestiture of businessweek at cc selling and general expenses increased as compared to the prior year due to higher costs associated with increased sales and higher compensation partially offset by the benefits of costsaving initiatives and the divestiture of businessweek  

net interest expense increased primarily due to the reversal of interest expense on uncertain tax positions that occurred in 2009 as well as lower international interest income from our investments in 2010 compared to 2009 

other items 

foreign exchange rates had favorable impacts of 48 million on revenue and 17 million on operating income this impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between currentyear and prioryear foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business functional currency 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we initiated a restructuring plan at mhe to create a flatter and more agile organization and across other parts of the company as part of our growth and value plan which includes creating two independent public companies with focused cost structures we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 66 million consisting primarily of facility exit costs and employee severance costs related to a companywide workforce reduction of approximately 800 positions 

foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 13 million on revenue and an unfavorable impact of 3 million on operating income this impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between currentyear and prioryear foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business functional currency 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we recorded a pretax charge of 16 million related to subleasing excess space through january 2020 that is managed by our corporate office 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 we initiated a restructuring plan within our cc segment as a result of current business conditions as well as continuing process improvements we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 11 million consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 230 positions 

during 2010 we recorded a pretax gain of 11 million from dispositions in other income loss within the consolidated statements of income which was comprised of the following 

 

  

 the impact of these divestitures on comparability of results is immaterial 

provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 363 for 2011 2010 and 2009 including discontinued operations the effective tax rate was 365 for 2011 and 364 for 2010 and 2009 

we do not expect our 2012 effective tax rate for continuing operations to vary significantly from our 2011 effective tax rate from continuing operations absent the impact of numerous factors including intervening audit settlements changes in federal state or foreign law and changes in the geographical mix of our income 

  

segment review 

sp ratings 

credit ratings are one of several tools that investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments they are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer such as a corporation or state or city government to meet its financial obligations in full and on time our credit ratings can also speak to the credit quality of an individual debt issue such as a corporate or municipal bond and the relative likelihood that the issuer may default 

sp ratings differentiates its revenue between transactional and nontransactional transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with 

 

  

  

 nontransaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating annual fees for customer relationshipbased pricing programs and fees for entity credit ratings 

 

  

the following items had an impact on results for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 2010 

 

  

 revenue 

revenue increased compared to 2010 as nontransaction revenue growth offset the slight decline in transaction revenue nontransaction revenue includes an intersegment royalty charged to sp capital iq  sp indices for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by sp ratings royalty revenue for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 was 63 million and 56 million respectively 

the decrease in transaction revenue was driven primarily by declines in public finance and structured finance these declines were partially offset by increases at corporate ratings due to growth in bank loan ratings and highyield corporate bond ratings revenue us municipal bond issuance decreased as municipal market volume continues to decline driven by the expiration of the build america 

  

bond program at the end of 2010 however fourth quarter us municipal bond par issuance was up 9 from the third quarter of 2011 continuing the trend of quarterly issuance volume increases this year declines in structured finance were driven by lower issuance volumes in the us of residential mortgagebacked securities “rmbs” collateralized debt obligations “cdo” and assetbacked securities “abs” 

revenue derived from nontransaction related sources increased compared to 2010 primarily as a result of growth in nonissuance related revenue at corporate ratings primarily for entity credit ratings ratings evaluation services and surveillance fees and crisil our majority owned indian credit rating agency primarily for outsourcing services and the acquisition of pipal research in december 2010 this was partially offset by declines in structured finance related to lower annual fees that were adversely impacted by increased deal maturities and defaults primarily on cdo deals annual fees include surveillance fees and other customer relationshipbased fees nontransaction revenue represented a larger percentage of total sp ratings revenue for 2011 compared to 2010 as transaction revenue decreased and nontransaction revenue increased in 2011 due to the factors discussed above 

both transaction and nontransaction revenue grew compared to 2009 the increase in transaction revenue compared to 2009 was driven by significant global highyield corporate bond issuance increased us bank loan ratings and robust us public finance issuance partially offset by declines in structured finance the bulk of the highyield corporate bond issuance related to refinancing activity as borrowers took advantage of low rates replacing existing bonds with cheaper debt structured finance decreased with a greater decline in europe resulting primarily from decreased central banks’ repurchase “repo” activity and lower deal breakage fees also contributing to the decrease was lower issuance in the us abs and rmbs these declines in us structured finance were partially offset by an increase in revenue from commercial mortgagebacked securities “cmbs” 

revenue derived from nontransaction related sources increased compared to 2009 primarily as a result of growth in annual surveillance and nonissuance related revenue at corporate ratings this was partially offset by declines in structured finance related to lower surveillance fees that were adversely impacted by increased cdo deal maturities and defaults deal breakage fees were lower as well nontransaction related revenue represented a smaller percentage of total sp rating’s revenue for 2010 compared to 2009 as transaction revenue grew at a faster pace 

operating income 

operating income decreased compared to 2010 due to increased expenses resulting from staff increases incremental compliance and regulatory costs and a decline in transaction revenue partially offset by growth in nontransaction revenue as noted above 

operating income increased compared to 2009 primarily due to the growth in transaction revenue partially offset by declines in structured finance as noted above and increases in incentive compensation incremental compliance and regulatory costs and staff increases mainly in india 

issuance volumes 

we monitor issuance volumes as an indicator of trends in transaction revenue streams within sp ratings issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on the domicile of the issuer issuance volumes can be reported in two ways by “domicile” which is based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located or based on “marketplace” which is where the bonds are sold the following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on thomson financial harrison scott publications and sp rating’s internal estimates 

 

  

  

   

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 industry highlights and outlook 

we believe the longer term outlook for the corporate bond market continues to be healthy there is a large amount of maturing global corporate debt which will eventually need to be refunded over the next several years also in europe nonfinancial issuance should continue to be bolstered by a shift in corporate financing from bank loans to bonds resulting from increased bank capital requirements however in the shortterm issuers may exercise some discretion as to the timing of the refunding transactions depending upon market conditions during the second half of 2011 the volatility of the capital markets increased dramatically as the result of sovereign debt and economic concerns as a result credit spreads for both investment grade and high yield issuance widened substantially reducing issuance activity we expect corporate bond issuance to be subdued until the market volatility stabilizes once this occurs we expect a resurgence in market activity as many issuers are still waiting for more favorable market conditions in which to issue corporate bonds 

structured finance nontransaction revenue declined in 2011 as surveillance fees have been adversely impacted by the reduction in cdo deals outstanding through maturities and defaults the outlook for the cdo market is dependent upon banks’ willingness to initiate new loans and investors’ risk appetite to invest in new cdo structures 

the recovery of the rmbs and cmbs markets are ultimately dependent upon the recovery of both residential and commercial real estate markets the us cmbs market has fared better than the european cmbs market as the european market has been more unfavorably affected by the slowdown in economic growth increasing cmbs volumes will be somewhat dependent on the refinancing of commercial loans the us rmbs market will continue to remain under pressure given continued uncertainty over home prices and unemployment although the european rmbs issuancevolumes were strong during the first half of 2011 they did weaken during the second half of 2011 and any potential resurgence is dependent upon sovereign and economic concerns subsiding 

we expect a modest increase in overall issuance volumes relative to 2011 in the us as both auto and credit card issuance should grow in the european abs market we expect a steady volume of growth and further credit card issuance in the united kingdom the market continues to adjust to new and proposed rules and regulations from the fdic financial accounting standards board and sec which may increase the cost to issuers of creating these types of structured finance instruments going forward in addition we anticipate a positive outlook on covered bond issuance in europe due to recent regulatory initiatives that are favorable to covered bonds they have also proven to be resilient during the european sovereign crisis 

  

legal and regulatory environment 

the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the us and abroad the businesses conducted by our sp ratings segment are in certain cases regulated under the credit rating agency reform act of 2006 the us securities exchange act of 1934 andor the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business 

standard  poor’s ratings services is a credit rating agency that is registered with the sec as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization “nrsro” the sec first began designating nrsro’s in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the sec’s net capital rule 

the “credit rating agency reform act of 2006” the “act” created a new sec registration system for rating agencies that volunteer to be recognized as nrsro’s under the act the sec is given authority and oversight of nrsro’s and can censure nrsro’s revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases the rules implemented by the sec pursuant to the act address among other things prevention or misuse of material nonpublic information conflicts of interest and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies the public portions of the current version of sp ratings’s form nrsro are available on sp rating’s web site 

outside the us regulators and government officials have been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies sp ratings is subject to regulations in several foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally including the international organization of securities commissions and the european securities and markets authority to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements sp ratings expects regulators in additional countries to introduce new regulations in the future 

we have reviewed the new laws regulations and rules which have been adopted and have implemented or are planning to implement changes as required we do not believe that such new laws regulations or rules will have a materially adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations other laws regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local national foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings rotation of credit rating agencies and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies the impact on us of the adoption of any such laws regulations or rules remains uncertain but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to sp rating’s rating activities 

for a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in the sp ratings business see item 1a risk factors specific to our standard  poor’s ratings segment  in this form 10k 

in the normal course of business both in the us and abroad the company and its subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are involved from time to time in governmental and selfregulatory agency proceedings which may result in adverse judgments damages fines or penalties also various governmental and selfregulatory agencies regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning compliance with applicable laws and regulations

sp capital iq  sp indices 

sp capital iq  sp indices differentiates its revenue between subscription and nonsubscription subscription revenue primarily includes 

 

  

  

  

 nonsubscription revenue is generated primarily from products in sp indices specifically through fees based on assets underlying exchangetraded funds “etfs” as well as certain advisory pricing and analytical services in our integrated desktop solutions group 

  

  

the following items had an impact on results for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

 2010 

 

 revenue 

subscription and nonsubscription revenue grew compared to 2010 subscription revenue increased compared to 2010 primarily due to growth at integrated desktop solutions this was driven by platform enhancements resulting in market share gains and increased contract values for existing accounts at capital iq the acquisition of themarketscom in september 2010 and growth in the subscription base both in new clients and in further expanding the existing customer base for the global credit portal which includes ratingsdirect enterprise solutions also contributed to the increase driven primarily by growth in the subscription base for global data solutions which includes ratingsxpress from new client relationships and expanded relationships into existing accounts 

capital iq continues to have significant client growth as the number of clients as of december 31 2011 increased 14 from the prior year traditionally subscription revenue has been primarily domestic however due to the continued enhancements of the capital iq international database strong sales for the global credit portal and ratingsxpress particularly in europe doubledigit international growth occurred in 2011 

nonsubscription revenue increased primarily at sp indices as total revenue increased 18 revenue from sp indices represents 24 of total sp capital iq  sp indices revenue in 2011 sp indices increased due to a mix of higher average levels of assets under management for etf products linked to our indices significant increases in exchangetraded derivatives from higher trading volumes as a result of recent market volatility increased mutual fund revenue higher sales from overthecounter derivatives and 73 new etfs launched during 2011 assets under management for etfs rose 5 to 314 billion in 2011 from 300 billion in 2010 also contributing to the increase in subscription revenue were higher data and custom index sales 

subscription and nonsubscription revenue grew compared to 2009 subscription revenue increased compared to 2009 driven by increases at ratings direct and ratingsxpress growth at capital iq and sp indices and the acquisition of themarketscom in september 2010 these factors were partially offset by declines in investment research products revenue from ratingsdirect and ratingsxpress increased as a result of strong growth in our subscription base from new client relationships and expanded relationships into existing accounts the number of capital iq clients at december 31 2010 increased 16 from 2009 increased data sales to financial institutions at sp indices contributed to the increased subscription revenue offsetting these increases were decreases in investment research products primarily resulting from the expiration of the independent equity research settlement at the end of july 2009 

nonsubscription revenue at sp indices increased mainly due to growth in etf products from higher levels of assets under management in addition to 95 new etfs launched during 2010 assets under management for etfs rose 22 to 300 billion in 2010 from 247 billion in 2009 due to the recovery in global markets in addition sp indices benefitted from etfs changing their benchmarks to our indices in 2010 

  

operating income 

operating income increased compared to 2010 primarily due to growth in etf products increases in the subscription base for the global credit portal and global data solutions and strong results in our cusip business in enterprise solutions in addition growth at capital iq and the acquisition of themarketscom contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by higher personnel costs and staff increases internationally mainly in india and additional costs to build out our integrated data feed within global data solutions and costs to further develop our infrastructure 

operating income increased slightly compared to 2009 primarily due to increases at sp indices and increases from ratings direct and ratingsxpress this was partially offset by declines in investment research products as noted above and increases in incentive compensation and staff increases internationally mainly in india and dilution from the acquisition of themarketscom 

industry highlights and outlook 

the segment is focused on integrating and evolving its assets and capabilities into one scaled business that offers unique highvalue offerings across all asset classes as a result of this integration demand is expected to continue to increase for our capital iq and data and information offerings in 2012 also products at sp indices should continue to benefit as etf assets grow globally while market volatility is expected to continue in 2012 an anticipated recovering economy and a slightly less volatile market may slow growth in our traded sp indices products this group also should see opportunities in products internationally primarily in the middle east and asia further crossselling opportunities will continue to present themselves as sp indices launched a product in 2011 that has capabilities to integrate with our capital iq platform 

in addition in november 2011 we announced an agreement with cme group to establish a new joint venture in the rapidly growing index business under this agreement we will contribute our sp indices business and the cme groupdow jones joint venture will contribute the dow jones indices business to create spdow jones indices a global leader in index services spdow jones indices is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2012 subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions 

legal and regulatory environment 

the financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the us and abroad the businesses conducted by sp capital iq  sp indices are in certain cases regulated under the us investment advisers act of 1940 the us securities exchange act of 1934 andor the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business 

the markets for financial research investment and advisory services are very competitive sp capital iq  sp indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of its research and advisory services client service reputation price geographic scope range of products and services and technological innovation 

on november 17 2009 the european commission directorategeneral for competition “ec” sent a statement of objections “so” to the company outlining the ec’s preliminary view that standard  poor’s cusip service bureau an sp rating’s brand that is part of sp capital iq  sp indices was abusing its position as the soleappointed national numbering agency for us securities by requiring financial institutions and information service providers to pay licensing fees for the use of international securities identification numbers as set forth in the so the ec’s preliminary view was that this behavior amounted to unfair pricing and infringed european competition law the company believed these preliminary views were erroneous but in order to resolve the investigation proposed a set of commitments to the ec following market testing of the commitments further discussions between the parties and some limited modifications to the commitments the ec on november 15 2011 accepted and made those commitments legally binding and ended its investigation pursuant to the commitments cusip global services will create and distribute a new data feed of us international securities identification numbers tailored specifically to the institutions for their use within the european economic area within five months

commodities  commercial 

cc includes such brands as platts jd power and associates “jdpa” mcgrawhill construction and aviation week the broadcasting group had historically been part of cc as of december 30 2011 we completed the sale of the broadcasting group and in accordance with the presentation of the broadcasting group as discontinued operations the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect this change see note 2 – acquisitions divestitures and other significant events to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

 

  

the following items had an impact on results for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 2010 

 

 revenue 

revenue increased primarily by strong demand for platts’ proprietary content and by growth in syndicated studies and consulting services across our automotive and nonautomotive sectors 

platts’ revenue grew by more than 21 and represents nearly 47 of total cc revenue for the year platts’ global commodities products primarily related to petroleum and natural gas have shown strong growth as continued volatility in commodity prices drove the need for market information the spread between the highest and lowest price for crude oil futures during the year was approximately 63 greater than the spread in the prior year the growth rate in international revenue across the commodities products was strong across all regions particularly in asia and europe 

international growth for our automotive revenue was strong in 2011 across all regions also contributing to our revenue growth for 2011 was the final transitioning during 2010 of certain automotive syndicated studies to an online service platform this resulted in revenue that was deferred last year to be recognized this year the majority of this revenue has now been recognized so this will not continue to favorably impact revenue comparisons in 2012 

partially offsetting these increases at cc were decreases in our construction business as market declines have continued to slow new business growth 

revenue declined compared to 2009 primarily driven by the divestiture of businessweek in december 2009 offsetting this decline was continued revenue growth in our global commodities information products primarily related to oil continued volatility in crude oil and other commodity prices drove the need for market information particularly in europe and asia 

operating income 

the key drivers for operating income growth in the segment for 2011 were the revenue growth mentioned above along with lower compensation costs as a result of restructuring actions additional costs from our acquisition of bentek energy llc and steel business briefing group partially offset the growth in the segment also impacting operating income were a number of nonrecurring items consisting of a writeoff of deferred costs recorded in prior periods offset by a gain on the sale of our interest in linkedin corporation as discussed in more detail in note 2 – acquisitions divestitures and other significant events to our consolidated financial statements and insurance recoveries on costs incurred in prior periods 

  

2010 

key drivers for operating profit growth in the segment compared to 2009 were the positive impact of the divestiture of businessweek and growth in our global commodities information products 

see note 13 – commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for legal matters affecting the segment 

industry highlights and outlook 

in 2012 cc expects to continue to invest in digital capabilities that will enable the businesses to become more integrated creating a foundation for the development of new products and revenue streams the segment will further expand its presence in selected markets and geographies to help drive growth 

the continuing growth in oil demand and the uncertainty of supply causes volatility in energy prices which will drive market participant demand for platt’s proprietary content including news price assessments and analytics to enable trading decisions the international energy agency projects that world oil consumption will grow by 13 million barrels per day to 903 million barrels per day in 2012 the most dynamic emerging market growth has come from china where oil demand is expected to grow 53 this year which is the fastest rate of any country in the world 

demand for our automotive studies is driven by the performance of the automotive industry in 2011 global and us light vehicle sales increased 4 and 10 respectively compared to 2010 largely as a result of continued strength in emerging markets recovery in western europe and us demand for 2012 jdpa projects growth for global and us light vehicle sales of approximately 8 and 9 year on year growth in 2012 is expected to be driven primarily by the continued recovery in the mature automotive markets and growth in the emerging automotive markets leading to increased demand for jdpa automotive consulting retail and quality tracking and other proprietary services likewise improved economic conditions are expected to facilitate growth in jdpa’s traditional nonautomotive businesses globally 

demand for our construction offerings is primarily dependent on the nonresidential construction industry in 2011 the value of new construction starts declined 2 from a year ago in 2011 nonresidential building construction declined 4 from a year ago while residential building climbed 2 compared to 2010 helped by the strengthening multifamily housing sector nonbuilding construction in 2011 was down 3 from a year ago as decreased activity for public works was partially offset by a sharp gain for electric utilities in 2012 total construction starts are forecast to rise 2 reflecting renewed strengthening for the housing sector and modest growth for commercial building from extremely low levels commercial building in 2012 is estimated to rise 10 at the same time tight federal and state budget conditions will have a dampening impact in 2012 on institutional building down 2 and public works construction down 5 

mcgrawhill education 

mhe consists of two operating groups the school education group “seg” serving the elementary and high school “elhi” markets and the higher education professional and international group “hpi” serving the college and university professional international and adult education markets 

 

 the following items had an impact on results for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 2010 

 

  

   

revenue 

school education group 

revenue at seg decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in the adoption states that was largely driven by texas last year seg received significant revenue related to the state’s readingliterature adoption but this year’s adoption for other curriculum areas offered less revenue potential for seg florida sales declined for the year as opportunities in this year’s science adoption could not match our results in last year’s math adoption also impacting the revenue decline was our decision to participate in fewer adoption subject categories in several states owing to funding uncertainties these decreases were offset by higher sales in california where the state’s largest district los angeles unified adopted mcgrawhill’s california treasures as its new k5 reading program sales were also higher in louisiana where our science programs were successful 

sales in the open territory decreased from the prior year due to lower sales in pennsylvania new york ohio minnesota and alaska a significant factor in the decline is the success seg had last year in capturing federal stimulus funds which were largely spent by 2011 and thus fewer opportunities were available partially offsetting these declines were higher sales in maryland for elementary reading products 

custom testing revenue increased slightly primarily due to increases in the scope of work for a contract in the middle east partially offset by the timing of revenue in missouri formative assessment declined slightly as did noncustom or “shelf” revenue a factor affecting this year’s testing market was lowerthananticipated spending of race to the top funds by the awardwinning states and assessment consortia however all grants made in 2010 must be spent within a fouryear period which should improve opportunities in 2012 2013 and 2014 

revenue was essentially flat compared to 2009 as higher sales in the state new adoption market were offset by declines in open territory sales and in custom testing revenue that did not repeat due to the discontinuation of contracts in florida arizona and california seg’s sales in the adoption states increased from 2009 the largest growth occurred in texas which did not adopt new materials in 2009 but conducted a k12 reading and literature adoption in 2010 also contributing to the increase were higher sales in florida where purchasing was driven by the k12 math adoption offsetting this growth were reductions in sales in tennessee where 2010 adoption offered less potential than the 2009 adoption and south carolina where a scheduled highschool math adoption was not funded residual sales in the adoption states decreased as compared to 2009 because more schools bought new materials this year for implementation in the fall and as a result they reordered fewer previously adopted materials in the k12 market new basal programs are implemented at the beginning of the fall term and therefore the majority of the purchasing is done in the second and third quarters in a number of adoption states pressures on educational budgets caused many school districts to limit or postpone purchases of educational materials during the year 

seg’s sales in the open territory decreased from 2009 due to lower sales in ohio new jersey missouri and michigan as a result of state and district budget constraints illinois also contributed to the decrease by suspending its textbook loan program which normally provides purchasing assistance to local districts during 2010 

in addition to the declines in custom testing noncustom or “shelf” testing also decreased compared to 2009 across all product lines these decreases in testing were partially offset by an increase in formative assessment due to the continued growth of seg’s acuity program resulting from new business and renewals of existing business 

higher education professional and international 

in the hpi group higher education increased from the prior year due to strong growth in several disciplines notably business and economics as well as significant growth in digital revenue driven by the homework management product line primarily mcgrawhill connect  our agreement with blackboard contributed to higher education’s revenue as instructors and students began to activate connect through the blackboard platform sales generated by mcgrawhill create and other custom learning solutions also increased as more and more instructors chose to build their own curriculums 

 

 professional increased slightly over the prior year due to continued growth in digital subscription revenue and in ebook sales which were driven by the proliferation of ereading devices during 2011 these gains were partially offset by a decline in print book sales that was driven principally by conditions in the retail market 

  

international decreased slightly from the prior year as lower sales in asia europe the middle east and africa where regional conditions affected some markets were offset by growth in latin america india and canada 

higher education increased for both print and digital products driven by higher enrollments in the academic year and by strong publication lists and attractive new digital offerings in all major subject areas 

 

  

 professional increased over 2009 due to increases in net book publishing sales including both print books and ebooks as returns were significantly lower than the prior year growth in other digital revenue primarily from digital subscription products also contributed to the increase 

international increased slightly over 2009 driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates higher sales in the middle east africa and asia were partially offset by declines in canada and in other international markets 

operating income 

operating income for mhe declined compared to 2010 primarily due to declines in revenue at seg as noted above as well as increased costs primarily due to technology requirements and the continuing investment in digital product development this decrease was partially offset by a reduction in plant amortization lower reserve requirements tight overall cost controls and lower selling and marketing expenses given the reduced revenue opportunities 

operating income for mhe improved compared to 2009 primarily due to the increases in higher education sales combined with lower costs and expenses notably reduced prepublication amortization lower costs related to inventory costsaving initiatives and savings from the realignment of several business operations within the segment that occurred during the second quarter of 2009 

industry highlights and outlook 

according to statistics compiled by aap total net sales of elementary and secondary instructional materials decreased by 94 through december 2011 net sales for the industry in the adoption states decreased by 127 compared to 2010 and net sales in the open territory states decreased by 57 compared to 2010 

total us prek12 enrollment for 20112012 is estimated at nearly 56 million students up 03 from 20102011 according to the national center for education statistics “nces” we project that the 2012 elhi market could decrease by approximately 9 versus the 2011 market this decline reflects lower opportunities in the adoption states where the most significant reduction is anticipated in texas although there will be some carryover purchasing from the 2011 adoption texas will not be adopting new materials in 2012 key adoption opportunities will be offered by k12 social studies in florida k12 reading and literature in mississippi k12 math in alabama and continued purchasing of reading and literature in california as in 2011 the size of the new adoption market in 2012 will depend to a considerable extent on the level of funding provided in each state in recent years several adoption states have begun operating more like open territory states in that fewer local districts within these states are purchasing newly statelisted materials in the early years of adoption in the open territory itself however sales are projected to increase slightly in 2012 after declining in 2011 

revenue at hpi is affected by enrollments higher education funding and the number of courses available to students the median projected increase in us college enrollments is a rise of 13 to 206 million between 2007 and 2018 according to nces the us college new textbook market is 45 billion and is expected to grow about 03 in 2012 as technology continues to be the key trend in higher education for course management and content delivery hpi will continue its digital transformation by aggressively pursuing a variety of einitiatives including ebooks homework support for students and online faculty support 

liquidity and capital resources 

we continue to maintain a strong financial position our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators income and consequently cash provided from operations during the year are significantly impacted by the seasonality of our businesses particularly educational publishing the first quarter is the smallest accounting for 21 of revenue and 14 of income from continuing operations in 2011 the third quarter is the largest accounting for 31 of revenue and generating 44 of 2011 income from continuing operations this seasonality also impacts cash flow and related borrowing patterns as investments for mhe are typically made in the first half of the year to support the strong selling period that occurs in the third quarter as a result our cash flow is typically lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half 

  

in 2012 cash on hand cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future we use our cash for a variety of needs including among others ongoing investments in our businesses strategic acquisitions share repurchases dividends investment in publishing programs capital expenditures and investment in our digital initiatives and infrastructure 

cash flow overview 

cash and cash equivalents were 944 million as of december 31 2011 a decrease of 582 million as compared to december 31 2010 and consisted of domestic cash of 296 million and cash held abroad of 648 million typically cash held outside the us is anticipated to be utilized to fund international operations or to be reinvested outside of the us as a significant portion of our opportunities for growth in the coming years are expected to be abroad in the event funds from international operations are needed to fund operations in the us we would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the us to repatriate these funds 

 

 in 2011 we generated free cash flow of 807 million versus 881 million in 2010 a decrease of 74 million the decline is due primarily to a decrease in cash provided by operating activities as discussed below free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and dividends in 2011 free cash flow was adjusted for the taxes paid on the sale of our broadcasting group capital expenditures include investments in prepublication costs purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects see “reconciliation of nongaap financial information” on page 33 for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

our consolidated statements of cash flows include amounts related to discontinued operations in 2011 cash flows from investing activities include proceeds of 216 million from the sale of our broadcasting group discontinued operations did not have a significant impact on cash flows from operating investing and financing activities in 2010 and 2009 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities decreased 114 million to 13 billion in 2011 mainly due to increased payments to vendors higher payments for incentives and higher legal and thirdparty consulting payments partially offset by an increase in other assets and liabilities primarily due to higher pension plan contributions in 2010 

higher incentive compensation payments in 2011 reflect greater achievement against targeted results in 2010 as compared to achievement against targets in 2009 

investing activities 

our cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions investment in prepublication costs and capital expenditures while cash inflows are primarily from dispositions 

cash used for investing activities decreased 351 million to 246 million in 2011 primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our broadcasting group in december 2011 and a higher amount of cash paid for acquisitions in 2010 in 2011 we acquired steel business briefing group and bentek energy llc both included as part of cc and assets of bookette software company were integrated with mhe in 2010 we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of pipal research corporation and themarketscom llc which were included as part of sp capital iq  sp indices substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of tegrity ltd which were included as part of mhe and a minority interest in ambow education holding ltd refer to note 2 – acquisitions divestitures and other significant events to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

financing activities 

our cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases and dividends while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

  

cash used for financing activities increased 11 billion to 17 billion in 2011 the increase is primarily attributable to cash used to repurchase shares during 2011 we utilized cash to repurchase approximately 35 million shares for 15 billion including commissions the average price per share excluding commissions was 4048 average price per share excludes the accelerated share repurchase transaction discussed in more detail below we repurchased 9 million shares for 256 million including commissions during 2010 the average price per share excluding commissions was 2937 the repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options 

in 2011 8 million shares have been repurchased to complete the stock repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors in 2007 the “2007 repurchase program” as of december 31 2011 no shares remained available under the 2007 repurchase program 

on june 29 2011 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares the “2011 repurchase program” which was approximately 17 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time the 2011 repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions depending on market conditions as of december 31 2011 24 million shares remained available under the 2011 repurchase program 

on december 7 2011 we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements “asr agreements” to initiate share repurchases aggregating 500 million the first asr agreement was structured as an uncollared asr agreement in which we paid 250 million on december 12 2011 and received an initial delivery of approximately 5 million shares subject to a 20 or 50 million holdback the second asr agreement was structured as a capped asr agreement in which we paid 250 million and received approximately 5 million shares representing the minimum number of common shares to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specific capped price per share further discussion relating to our asr agreements can be found in note 9 – equity to our consolidated financial statements 

additional financing 

currently we have the ability to borrow 12 billion in additional funds through our commercial paper program which is supported by our 12 billion threeyear credit agreement our “credit facility” that will terminate on july 30 2013 we pay a commitment fee of 15 to 35 basis points for our credit facility depending on our credit rating whether or not amounts have been borrowed and currently pay a commitment fee of 20 basis points the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is at our option calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london interbank offer rate the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate for certain borrowings under our credit facility there is also a spread based on our credit rating added to the applicable rate as of december 31 2011 we have not utilized our credit facility for additional funds 

our credit facility contains certain covenants the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility is not greater than 4 to 1 and this covenant has never been exceeded 

historically we have also had the ability to borrow additional funds through extendible commercial notes and a promissory note with one of our providers of banking services however effective april of 2011 we have canceled these notes since there is no current market for them 

dividends 

on january 18 2012 the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend from 025 per share to 0255 per share 

contractual obligations 

we typically have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets while other items such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not recognized but are disclosed herein for example we are contractually committed to acquire paper and other printing services and make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements 

we believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand cash flow expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations capital expenditures working capital and debt service for 2012 

  

the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2011 over the next several years additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements as referenced in the footnotes to the table 

 

  

  

  

  

 as of december 31 2011 we had 57 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits we have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable 

we make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans during 2011 we contributed 29 million and 10 million to our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively expected employer contributions in 2012 are 44 million and 10 million for our domestic and international retirement and postretirement plans respectively in 2012 we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status see note 7 – employee benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

at december 31 2011 and 2010 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities such as entities often referred to as specific purpose or variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financial liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships

free cash flow is a nongaap financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures investment in prepublication costs and dividends in 2011 free cash flow was adjusted for the taxes paid on the sale of our broadcasting group capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure to free cash flow 

we believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management we use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and dividends are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to service debt make strategic acquisitions and investments repurchase stock and fund ongoing operation and working capital needs 

  

the presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap free cash flow as we calculate it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies the following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow 

 

 critical accounting estimates 

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns valuation of inventories prepublication costs valuation of longlived assets goodwill and other intangible assets pension plans incentive compensation and stockbased compensation income taxes and contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this mda 

we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized as it is earned when goods are shipped to customers or services are rendered we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable we make our best estimate of the services’ stand alone selling price and recognize revenue as earned as the services are delivered the allocation of consideration received from multiple element arrangements that involve initial assignment of ratings and the future surveillance of ratings is determined through an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately in such cases we defer portions of rating fees that we estimate will be attributed to future surveillance and recognize the deferred revenue ratably over the estimated surveillance periods advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period 

product revenue consists of educational and information products primarily books magazine circulations and syndicated study products in our mhe and cc segments service revenue consists of our sp ratings and sp capital iq  sp indices segments the service assessment contracts of our mhe segment and informationrelated services and advertising of our cc segment 

for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 no significant changes have been made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of revenue or the methodologies applied based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2012 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 13 million a significant estimate in our mhe segment and particularly within hpi is the allowance for sales returns which is based on the historical rate of return and current market conditions should the estimate of the allowance for sales returns in hpi vary by one percentage point the impact on operating profit would be approximately 12 million 

for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2012 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market a significant estimate in our mhe segment is the reserve for inventory obsolescence in determining this reserve we consider management’s current assessment of the marketplace industry trends and projected product demand as compared to the number of units currently on hand the impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the estimate for inventory obsolescence is approximately 3 million 

for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the valuation of inventories and reserve for inventory obsolescence based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2012 

prepublication costs 

prepublication costs principally external preparation costs are amortized from the year of publication over their estimated useful lives one to six years using either an accelerated or straightline method the majority of the programs are amortized using an accelerated methodology we periodically evaluate the amortization methods rates remaining lives and recoverability of such costs which are sometimes dependent upon program acceptance by state adoption authorities in evaluating recoverability we consider our current assessment of the marketplace industry trends and the projected success of programs 

for the year ended december 31 2011 prepublication amortization expense was 198 million representing 8 of consolidated operatingrelated expenses and 10 of our mhe segment’s total expenses the impact on consolidated amortization expense for a one percentage point change in the annual prepublication amortization is approximately 2 million 

for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 no significant changes have been made to the amortization rates applied to prepublication costs the underlying assumptions related to estimates of amortization or the methodology applied based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2012 

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets there were no material impairments of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired as of december 31 2011 and 2010 the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets was 22 billion and 21 billion respectively goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 

goodwill 

as part of our annual impairment test of our 5 reporting units we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units 

  

is less than its carrying amount if based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test under the accounting rules in effect in 2010 and 2009 we were automatically required to perform a quantitative impairment test for each of our reporting units 

for 2011 based on our qualitative assessments we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair value was greater than their respective carrying amounts with the exception of our seg reporting unit our qualitative assessment included but was not limited to consideration of macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors cash flows changes in key company personnel and our share price 

for our seg reporting unit in 2011 and for all of our reporting units in 2010 and 2009 in the first step of our quantitative impairment test the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach which incorporates the use of discounted free cash flow “dcf” analyses and are corroborated using the market approach which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data the dcf analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated longterm growth projections for each reporting unit future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate in addition we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness taking into account certain factors including control premiums 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

based on our quantitative assessment performed during the fourth quarter of 2011 at seg the fair value of seg exceeded its carrying value by more than 25 goodwill associated with seg as of december 31 2011 is 467 million significant judgments inherent in this analysis include estimating the amount of and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and longterm growth rate assumptions given the current market conditions and continued uncertainty with state budgets there could be changes to our seg estimates and assumptions that could materially affect the determination of their fair value and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations increasing our discount rate by 1 would not have resulted in the carrying value exceeding the applicable fair value of seg we will continue to monitor the recoverability of goodwill at all our reporting units in 2012 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value our only indefinitelived intangible asset is jdpa’s trade name and the fair value is estimated using the income approach if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment is estimated using the income approach the fair value of loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

retirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits 

our employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances including compensation increases longterm return on pension plan assets healthcare cost trends discount rates and other factors in determining such assumptions we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate in accordance with relevant accounting standards if actual results differ from our assumptions such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants while we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits 

the following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

  

  

  

 our discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our us retirement plans are as follows 

 

 stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operating expense and selling and general expense in the consolidated statements of income 

stockbased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 was 96 million 67 million and 22 million respectively 

included in stockbased compensation expense is restricted stock and unit awards expense of 72 million in 2011 45 million in 2010 and 2 million in 2009 

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted 

 

 because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

our effective tax rate for continuing operations was 363 for 2011 2010 and 2009 including discontinued operations the effective tax rate was 365 for 2011 and 364 for 2010 and 2009 

  

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2012 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable on the basis of present information it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

for our foreign subsidiaries we have determined that the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries are permanently reinvested within its foreign operations accordingly we have not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings a future distribution by the foreign subsidiaries of these earnings could result in additional tax liability which may be material to our future reported results financial position and cash flows 

for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we made no material changes in our assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes however certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities thereby impacting our income tax provision 

contingencies 

we are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business we recognize a liability for such contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated we continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses and recognize a liability if any for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other experts because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter 

recently issued or adopted accounting standards 

there were no new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year which have had or are expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements see note 1 – accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements for further detail on applicable accounting pronouncements that were adopted in 2011 or will be effective for 2012 




 item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

there have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk during the year ended december 31 2011 our exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates we have operations in various foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency we typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities as of december 31 2011 we have entered into an immaterial amount of foreign exchange forwards to hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we have not entered into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

the board of directors and shareholders of the mcgrawhill companies inc 

we have audited the mcgrawhill companies inc’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on criteria established in internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria the mcgrawhill companies inc’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s annual report on its responsibility for the company’s financial statements and internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the mcgrawhill companies inc maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 based on the coso criteria 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of the mcgrawhill companies inc as of december 31 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of income equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 of the mcgrawhill companies inc and our report dated february 7 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

nature of operations 

the mcgrawhill companies inc together with its consolidated subsidiaries the “company” “we” “us” or “our” is a leading global information services provider serving the financial services education commercial and commodities markets with the information they need to succeed in the “knowledge economy” the commercial markets include automotive construction aerospace and defense and marketingresearch information services while the commodities market includes energy 

our operations consist of four operating segments which have historically been named standard  poor’s “sp” mcgrawhill financial mcgrawhill information  media and mcgrawhill education “mhe” as part of our growth and value plan we have changed the names of our four operating segments to align with how we plan on referring to the businesses going forward sp has changed to sp ratings mcgrawhill financial has been changed to sp capital iq  sp indices mcgrawhill information  media has changed to commodities  commercial “cc” and mhe has remained the same going forward the new mcgrawhill financial will include sp ratings sp capital iq  sp indices and cc 

 

  

  

  

 see note 12 – segment and geographic information  for further discussion on our operating segments which are also our reportable segments 

we have reported our broadcasting group previously included in our cc segment as a discontinued operation accordingly the results of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation and the assets and liabilities of the business have been reclassified as held for sale for the periods presented see note 2 – acquisitions divestitures and other significant events for further discussion 

on september 12 2011 we announced that our board of directors unanimously approved a comprehensive growth and value plan that includes separation into two public companies mcgrawhill financial focused on content and analytics for financial markets and mcgrawhill education focused on education services and digital learning on december 7 2011 management provided an update on our growth and value plan discussing new actions that will facilitate the separation into two independent companies highlighted actions included 

 

  

  

  

 we expect to complete the separation by the end of 2012 through a taxfree spinoff of the education business to the company’s shareholders subject to various conditions and regulatory approvals including final board approval and a tax ruling from the internal revenue service professional fees associated with the growth and value plan recorded during the fourth quarter of 2011 were approximately 10 million 

principles of consolidation 

the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and our share of earnings or losses of joint ventures and affiliated companies under the equity method of accounting all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 

  

use of estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

cash and cash equivalents 

cash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily liquidity and fixed term time deposits such investments and bank deposits are stated at cost which approximates market value and were 944 million and 15 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively these investments are not subject to significant market risk 

shortterm investments 

shortterm investments are securities with original maturities greater than 90 days that are available for use in our operations in the next twelve months the shortterm investments primarily consisting of certificates of deposit are classified as heldtomaturity and therefore are carried at cost interest and dividends are recorded into income when earned 

accounts receivable 

credit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value 

allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 

the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis a review of outstanding balances and current conditions in determining these reserves we consider amongst other factors the financial condition and risk profile of our customers areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators a significant estimate in our mhe segment and particularly within hpi is the allowance for sales returns which is based on the historical rate of return and current market conditions 

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout or market and the majority of our inventories relate to finished goods a significant estimate in our mhe segment is the reserve for inventory obsolescence in determining this reserve we consider management’s current assessment of the marketplace industry trends and projected product demand as compared to the number of units currently on hand 

prepublication costs 

prepublication costs principally external preparation costs are amortized from the year of publication over their estimated useful lives one to six years using either an accelerated or straightline method the majority of the programs are amortized using an accelerated methodology we periodically evaluate the amortization methods rates remaining lives and recoverability of such costs which are sometimes dependent upon program acceptance by state adoption authorities in evaluating recoverability we consider management’s current assessment of the marketplace industry trends and the projected success of programs 

deferred technology costs 

we capitalize certain software development and website implementation costs capitalized costs only include incremental direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop the software after the preliminary project stage is completed funding has been committed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended incremental costs are expenditures that are outofpocket to us and are not part of an allocation or existing expense base software development and website implementation costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage capitalized costs are amortized from the year the software is ready for its intended use over its estimated useful life three to seven years using the straightline method periodically we evaluate the amortization methods remaining lives and recoverability of such costs capitalized software development and website implementation costs are included in other noncurrent assets and are presented net of accumulated amortization gross deferred technology costs were 193 million and 164 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively accumulated amortization of deferred technology costs was 122 million and 105 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

accounting for the impairment of longlived assets including other intangible assets 

we evaluate longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable upon such an occurrence recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset for longlived assets held for sale assets are written down to fair value less cost to sell fair value is determined based on market evidence discounted cash flows appraised values or management’s estimates depending upon the nature of the assets there were no material impairments of longlived assets for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

  

goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired we have 5 reporting units with goodwill that are evaluated for impairment 

consistent with recently issued accounting rules we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount if based on our evaluation we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount no quantitative impairment test is performed conversely if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts we perform a twostep quantitative impairment test under the accounting rules in effect in 2010 and 2009 we were automatically required to perform a quantitative impairment test for each of our reporting units 

when conducting the first step of our two step impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach which incorporates the use of a discounted free cash flow “dcf” analyses and are corroborated using the market approach which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data the dcf analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated longterm growth projections for each reporting unit future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate in addition we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness taking into account certain factors including control premiums 

if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill the fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 

significant judgments inherent in this analysis include estimating the amount of and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and for some of the reporting units could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we evaluate the recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value our only indefinitelived intangible asset is jdpa’s trade name and the fair value is estimated using the income approach if the indefinitelived intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates royalty rates and longterm growth rate assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinitelived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge which could be material to our financial position and results of operations 

we performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

foreign currency translation 

we have operations in many foreign countries for most international operations the local currency is the functional currency for international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company the us dollar is the functional currency for local currency operations assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using end of period exchange rates and revenue and expenses are translated into us dollars using weightedaverage exchange rates foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of equity

revenue is recognized as it is earned when goods are shipped to customers or services are rendered we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained services are performed fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue relating to products that provide for more than one deliverable is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each deliverable as each deliverable is provided revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one service is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned if the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable management makes its best estimate of the services’ standalone selling price and records revenue as it is earned over the service period for arrangements that include multiple services 

  

fair value of the service components are determined using an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately advertising revenue is recognized when the page is run subscription income is recognized over the related subscription period 

product revenue consists of educational and information products primarily books magazine circulations and syndicated study products in our mhe and cc segments service revenue consists of our sp ratings and sp capital iq  sp indices segments the service assessment contracts of our mhe segment and informationrelated services and advertising of our cc segment 

shipping and handling costs 

all amounts billed to customers in a sales transaction for shipping and handling are classified as revenue 

depreciation 

the costs of property and equipment are depreciated using the straightline method based upon the following estimated useful lives buildings and improvements from 15 to 40 years and equipment and furniture from 2 to 10 years the costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases 

advertising expense 

the cost of advertising is expensed as incurred we incurred 52 million 50 million and 52 million in advertising costs in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period which typically is the vesting period stockbased compensation is classified as both operating expense and selling and general expense in the consolidated statements of income 

income taxes 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense respectively 

judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits in determining the need for a valuation allowance the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2012 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable on the basis of present information our opinion is that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

contingencies 

we accrue for loss contingencies when both a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated when we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range we record its best estimate within the range we disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred 

recently issued or adopted accounting standards 

recently issued 

in may 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new guidance for fair value measurements intended to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards the amended guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value to ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards the amended guidance changes certain 

  

fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements the amended guidance will be effective for us beginning january 1 2012 we do not anticipate that these changes will have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance that modified how comprehensive income is presented in an entity’s financial statements the guidance issued requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity the revised financial statement presentation for comprehensive income will be effective for us beginning january 1 2012 

recently adopted 

in december 2010 the fasb revised its guidance for disclosure requirements of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations the objective of the revised guidance is to address diversity in practice regarding proforma disclosures for revenue and earnings of an acquired entity and specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings the amendments which went into effect on january 1 2011 will be applied to any future material business combinations 

on january 1 2011 we adopted guidance issued by the fasb on revenue recognition under the new guidance when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of the selling price for a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement cannot be determined a best estimate of the selling price is required to allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing of when revenue is recognized adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact to our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2011 the fasb issued guidance that simplified how an entity tests goodwill for impairment the revised guidance provides an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment under the revised guidance an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether goodwill impairment exists prior to performing analyses comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required the guidance is effective beginning january 1 2012 however early adoption is permitted we adopted the fasb’s guidance during our fourth quarter ended december 31 2011

3 goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill 

goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired the following table summarizes the changes in the carrying value of goodwill for our segments 

 

 goodwill additionsdispositions in the table above relate to acquisitionsdispositions discussed in note 2 – acquisitions divestitures and other significant events

 definitelived intangible assets are being amortized on a straightline basis over periods of up to 40 years the weightedaverage life of the intangible assets at december 31 2011 is approximately 11 years amortization expense for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 and the projected amortization expense for intangible assets over the next five years for the years ended december 31 assuming no further acquisitions or dispositions is as follows 

 

   

4 fair value measurements 

in accordance with authoritative guidance for fair value measurements certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants a fair value hierarchy has been established which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows 

 

  

  

 we have investments in equity securities classified as availableforsale and an immaterial amount of forward exchange contracts that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis the fair values of our investments in availableforsale securities were determined using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets and are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy the fair values of our availableforsale securities are 136 million and 226 million as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 respectively and are included in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets 

other financial instruments including cash and equivalents and shortterm investments are recorded at cost which approximates fair value the fair value of our total borrowings is 13 billion as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 and was estimated based on quoted market prices 

5 taxes on income 

income before taxes on income resulted from domestic and foreign operations as follows 

 

 the provisionbenefit for taxes on income consists of the following 

 

   

a reconciliation of the us federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes is as follows 

 

 the principal temporary differences between the accounting for income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes are as follows 

 

 we record valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not based upon all the available evidence that such deferred income tax assets will not be realized the valuation allowance is primarily related to operating losses 

we have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations undistributed earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations amounted to 760 million at december 31 2011 quantification of the deferred tax liability if any associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable 

we made net income tax payments totaling 452 million in 2011 410 million in 2010 and 416 million in 2009 at december 31 2011 we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of 7 million which will expire between 2017 and 2029 and the utilization of these losses will be subject to limitations 

  

a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows 

 

 the net increase of 4 million in 2011 is the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that unfavorably impacted tax expense the unfavorable impact to the tax provision was partially offset by the favorable outcome of the completed federal state local and foreign tax audits 

the total amount of federal state and local and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2011 and 2010 was 57 million and 53 million respectively exclusive of interest and penalties we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expense respectively in addition to the unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we had 13 million and 14 million respectively of accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions 

during 2011 we effectively completed the us federal tax audit for 2010 and we also completed various state and foreign tax audits and with few exceptions we are no longer subject to state and local or nonus income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2004 the impact to tax expense in 2011 was not material 

during 2010 we effectively completed the us federal tax audit for 2009 and we also completed various state and foreign tax audits the impact to tax expense in 2010 was not material 

during 2009 we effectively completed the us federal tax audit for 2008 and we also completed various state and foreign tax audits resulting in a favorable impact to tax expense of 9 million 

however even though we have effectively completed the us federal tax audit for the years 2010 2009 2008 and 2007 those years remain open pending the appeal of a certain unresolved issue which we do not believe will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction various states and foreign jurisdictions and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities we believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law this assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events it is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to december 31 2012 if any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits until formal resolutions are reached between us and the tax authorities the determination of a possible audit settlement range with respect to the impact on unrecognized tax benefits is not practicable on the basis of present information it is our opinion that any assessments resulting from the current audits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

we do not expect our 2012 effective tax rate on continuing operations to vary significantly from our 2011 effective tax rate absent the impact of numerous factors including intervening audit settlements changes in federal state or foreign law and changes in the geographical mix of our income 

although the timing of income tax audit resolution and negotiations with taxing authorities are highly uncertain we do not anticipate a significant change to the total amount of unrecognized income tax benefits within the next twelve months 

  

6 debt 

a summary of shortterm and longterm debt outstanding is as follows 

 

   

  

 annual longterm debt maturities are scheduled as follows based on book values as of december 31 2011 approximately 400 million due in 2012 no amounts due from 20132015 and approximately 798 million due thereafter 

currently we have the ability to borrow 12 billion in additional funds through our commercial paper program which is supported by our 12 billion threeyear credit agreement our “credit facility” that will terminate on july 30 2013 we pay a commitment fee of 15 to 35 basis points for our credit facility depending on our credit rating whether or not amounts have been borrowed and currently pay a commitment fee of 20 basis points the interest rate on borrowings under our credit facility is at our option calculated using rates that are primarily based on either the prevailing london interbank offer rate the prime rate determined by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate for certain borrowings under this credit facility there is also a spread based on our credit rating added to the applicable rate as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we have not utilized our credit facility for additional funds 

our credit facility contains certain covenants the only financial covenant requires that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio as defined in our credit facility is not greater than 4 to 1 and this covenant has never been exceeded 

historically we have also had the ability to borrow additional funds through extendible commercial notes and a promissory note with one of our providers of banking services however effective april of 2011 we have canceled these notes since there is no current market for them 

7 employee benefits 

we have a number of defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees our primary pension plan is a noncontributory plan under which benefits are based on employee career employment compensation we also have unfunded nonus and supplemental benefit plans the supplemental benefit plans provide senior management with supplemental retirement disability and death benefits certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings in addition we sponsor voluntary 401k plans under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profitsharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees’ compensation to the employees’ accounts 

we also provide certain postretirement medical dental and life insurance benefits for retired employees and eligible dependents the medical and dental plans are contributory while the life insurance plan is noncontributory we currently do not prefund any of these plans 

we recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income net of taxes the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs these amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 

  

benefit obligation 

a summary of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets as well as the funded status for the retirement and postretirement plans as of december 31 is as follows benefits paid in the table below include only those amounts contributed directly to or paid directly from plan assets 

 

  the actuarial loss and prior service credit included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for our retirement plans and expected to be recognized in net periodic pension cost during the year ending december 31 2012 are 32 million and 1 million respectively 

the prior service credit included in accumulated other comprehensive loss for our postretirement plans and expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during the year ending december 31 2012 is 1 million there is no actuarial loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss for our postretirement plans expected to be recognized in net periodic benefit cost during the year ending december 31 2012 

  

net periodic cost 

for purposes of determining annual pension cost prior service costs are being amortized straightline over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits 

a summary of net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans for the years ended december 31 is as follows 

 

 our united kingdom “uk” retirement plan accounted for 3 million in 2011 and 6 million in 2010 and 2009 of the net periodic benefit cost attributable to the funded plans 

other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income net of tax for the years ended december 31 are as follows 

 

 the total cost for our retirement plans was 175 million for 2011 156 million for 2010 and 141 million for 2009 included in the total retirement plans cost are defined contribution plans cost of 88 million for 2011 and 83 million for 2010 and 2009 

assumptions 

 

   

   

  

 cash flows 

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the “act” was enacted the act established a prescription drug benefit under medicare known as “medicare part d” and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d our benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and accordingly we are entitled to a subsidy 

expected employer contributions in 2012 are 44 million for our retirement plans and 10 million for our postretirement plans in 2012 we may elect to make additional nonrequired contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status information about the expected cash flows for our retirement and postretirement plans and the impact of the medicare subsidy is as follows 

 

 

  

  

 fair value of plan assets 

the fair value of our defined benefit plans assets at the end of 2011 and 2010 by asset class is as follows see note 4 – fair value measurements  for a description of the fair value hierarchy 

 

 

   

 

   

  

  

  

 for securities that are quoted in active markets the trusteecustodian determines fair value by applying securities’ prices obtained from its pricing vendors for commingled funds that are not actively traded the trustee applies pricing information provided by investment management firms to the unit quantities of such funds investment management firms employ their own pricing vendors to value the securities underlying each commingled fund underlying securities that are not actively traded derive their prices from investment managers which in turn employ vendors that use pricing models eg discounted cash flow comparables the domestic defined benefit plans have no investment in our stock except through the sp 500 commingled index fund 

the trustee obtains estimated prices from vendors for securities that are not easily quotable and they are categorized accordingly as level 3 the following tables details further information our plan assets where we have used significant unobservable inputs level 3 

 

 

 pension trusts’ asset allocations 

there are two pension trusts one in the us and another in the uk 

 

  

 the pension assets are invested with the goal of producing a combination of capital growth and income the mix of assets is established after consideration of the longterm performance and risk characteristics of asset classes investments are selected based on their potential to enhance returns preserve capital and reduce overall volatility holdings are diversified within each asset class the portfolios employ a mix of index and actively managed equity strategies by market capitalization style geographic regions and economic sectors the fixed income strategies include us long duration us nonagency mortgage backed securities and uk debt instruments the shortterm portfolio whose primary goal is capital preservation for liquidity purposes is composed of government and governmentagency securities uninvested cash receivables and payables the portfolios do not employ any financial leverage 

  

us defined contribution plans 

assets of the defined contribution plans in the us consist primarily of investment options which include actively managed equity indexed equity actively managed equitybond funds mcgrawhill common stock stable value and money market strategies they also have a selfdirected investment option the plans purchased 695632 and sold 796934 shares of mcgrawhill common stock in 2011 and purchased 650225 and sold 645433 shares of mcgrawhill common stock in 2010 the plans held approximately 4 million shares of mcgrawhill common stock at december 31 2011 and 2010 with market values of 178 million and 149 million respectively the plans received dividends on mcgrawhill common stock of 4 million during 2010 and 2009 

8 stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased incentive awards to our eligible employees and directors under two employee stock ownership plans the 1993 and 2002 employee stock incentive plans and a director deferred stock ownership plan 

 

  

  

 the number of common shares reserved for issuance are as follows 

 

 

 1 shares reserved for issuance under the director deferred stock ownership plan are included in the total but are less than 1 million 

we issue treasury shares upon exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock and unit awards to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options we periodically repurchase shares see note 9 – equity for further discussion 

stockbased compensation expense and the corresponding tax benefit are as follows 

 

  

 

 stock options 

stock options which may not be granted at a price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant vest over a two year service period in equal annual installments and have a maximum term of 10 years therefore stock option compensation costs are recognized from the date of grant utilizing a twoyear graded vesting method under this method fifty percent of the costs are ratably recognized over the first twelve months with the remaining costs ratably recognized over a twentyfour month period starting from the date of grant 

  

we use a latticebased optionpricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted the following assumptions were used in valuing the options granted 

 

 because latticebased optionpricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions those ranges are disclosed these assumptions are based on multiple factors including historical exercise patterns postvesting termination rates expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of our stock price the riskfree interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant we use the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 

stock option activity is as follows 

 

  

 the total fair value of our stock options that vested during 2011 2010 and 2009 was 18 million 20 million and 25 million respectively 

we receive a tax deduction for certain stock option exercises during the period in which the options are exercised generally for the excess of the quoted market value of the stock at the time of the exercise of the options over the exercise price of the options “intrinsic value” for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 20 million 2 million and less than 1 million respectively of excess tax benefits from stock options exercised are reported in our cash flows used for financing activities 

  

information regarding our stock option exercises is as follows 

 

 restricted stock and unit awards 

restricted stock and unit awards performance and nonperformance have been granted under the 2002 plan restricted stock and unit performance awards will vest only if we achieve certain financial goals over the performance period restricted stock nonperformance awards have various vesting periods generally three years with vesting beginning on the first anniversary of the awards recipients of restricted stock and unit awards are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service 

the stockbased compensation expense for restricted stock and unit awards is determined based on the market price of our stock at the grant date of the award applied to the total number of awards that are anticipated to fully vest for restricted stock and unit performance awards adjustments are made to expense dependent upon financial goals achieved 

restricted stock and unit activity for performance and nonperformance awards is as follows 

 

  

 9 equity 

capital stock 

two million shares of preferred stock par value 1 per share are authorized none have been issued 

the following table provides detail of our dividend history on january 18 2012 the board of directors approved an increase in the dividends for 2012 to a quarterly rate of 0255 per common share 

 

 stock repurchases 

in 2007 the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 45 million shares the “2007 repurchase program” on june 29 2011 the board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to 50 million shares the “2011 repurchase program” which was approximately 17 of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time 

  

share repurchases under both the 2007 and the 2011 repurchase programs were as follows 

 

  

  

 our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options during the year ended december 31 2011 we repurchased 8 million shares under the 2007 repurchase program as of december 31 2011 there were no remaining shares available under the 2007 repurchase program during the year ended december 31 2011 we repurchased 26 million shares under the 2011 repurchase program as of december 31 2011 24 million shares remained available under the 2011 repurchase program the 2011 repurchase program has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions depending on market conditions 

accelerated share repurchase program 

on december 7 2011 we entered into two separate accelerated share repurchase agreements “asr agreements” with a financial institution to initiate share repurchases aggregating 500 million 

 

  

 uncollared asr agreement 

we paid 250 million on december 12 2011 and received an initial delivery of approximately 5 million shares from the financial institution subject to a 20 or 50 million holdback at the conclusion of the uncollared asr agreement which will occur on or before february 22 2012 we may receive additional shares or be required to pay additional cash or deliver shares at our option based on the vwap of our common stock subject to a discount agreed upon with the financial institution during the term of the uncollared asr agreement if necessary it is our intention to deliver additional shares rather than pay additional cash the financial institution will deliver any remaining shares to us shortly after the end of the term 

capped asr agreement 

we paid 250 million and received approximately 5 million shares representing the minimum number of common shares to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specific capped price per share the capped asr agreement commenced on december 7 2011 and will end on or before april 23 2012 the actual number of shares that will be received by us at the termination date of the capped asr agreement will be determined based on the vwap of our common stock during the term of the capped asr subject to the capped price for the purchased shares 

the asr agreements were accounted for as two transactions a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract the initial delivery of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of our outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net earnings per share the forward stock purchase contract is classified as an equity instrument increases in the vwap of our common stock during the term of the asr agreements would decrease the number of shares the financial institution would be required to deliver or increase the amount of cash or number of shares we would be required to deliver to the financial institution decreases in the vwap of our common stock during the term of our asr agreements would increase the number of shares the financial institution would be required to deliver to us as of december 31 2011 the holdback under the uncollared asr agreement and the excess amount paid on a per share basis for the minimum shares purchased under the capped asr agreement were recorded as reductions to additional paidin capital in our consolidated balance sheet we have evaluated the asr agreements for their potential dilution and as a result these additional shares were not included in our weighted average diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would be antidilutive 

  

accumulated other comprehensive loss 

 

 10 earnings per share 

basic earnings per common share “eps” is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the company by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding diluted eps is computed in the same manner as basic eps except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued potential common shares consist primarily of stock options restricted stock and restricted stock units calculated using the treasury stock method the calculation for basic and diluted eps is as follows 

 

 there were 2 million 1 million and 2 million restricted performance shares outstanding at december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share because the necessary vesting conditions have not yet been met 

the effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period because the effect would have been antidilutive for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 the number of stock options excluded from the computation was 10 million 23 million and 28 million respectively 

11 restructuring 

in order to contain costs and mitigate the impact of current and expected future economic conditions as well as continuing process improvements we have initiated various restructuring plans over the last several years the plans that are currently active with a remaining liability are further described below the charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income 

  

in certain circumstances reserves are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated in these cases we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income when it is determined they are no longer needed 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we initiated a restructuring plan at mhe to create a flatter and more agile organization and across other parts of the company as part of our growth and value plan which includes creating two independent public companies with focused cost structures we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 66 million consisting primarily of facility exit costs and employee severance costs related to a companywide workforce reduction of approximately 800 positions the remaining reserve at december 31 2011 is 62 million and is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 

activity of our restructuring liability for our 2011 restructuring actions by segment as of december 31 2011 is summarized as follows 

 

 during the fourth quarter of 2010 we initiated a restructuring plan within our cc segment as a result of business conditions at that time as well as continuing process improvements we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of 11 million consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to a workforce reduction of approximately 230 positions for years ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we have reduced the reserve related to the 2010 restructuring by 8 million and 2 million respectively primarily relating to cash payments for employee severance costs the remaining reserve as of december 31 2011 is 1 million and is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet

finding of wrongdoing it allows its recipients the opportunity to provide their perspective and to address the issues raised by the staff before any decision is made by the commission on whether to authorize the commencement of an enforcement proceeding against its recipients sp has responded to the staff presenting its position on the issues raised and why the commission should not commence enforcement proceedings 

the company believes that the claims in the proceedings described above have no basis and they will be vigorously defended by the company andor the subsidiaries involved 

in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the cases present novel legal theories involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery we cannot state with confidence what the eventual outcome of these pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss fines penalties or impact related to each pending matter may be we believe based on our current knowledge that the outcome of the legal actions proceedings and investigations currently pending should not have a material adverse effect on the company’s consolidated financial condition

in november of 2010 we realigned our previously reported financial services segment into two separate segments standard  poor’s “sp” and mcgrawhill financial “mh financial” to drive global growth and innovation specifically the establishment of mh financial allows us to organize our global financial information data and analytics on a common sales and marketing platform sp will be able to focus on creating enhanced credit risk benchmarks and research for the expanding global markets in the new and evolving regulatory environment as a result of the reorganization our operations now consist of four business segments sp mh financial mcgrawhill education “mhe” and mcgrawhill information  media “im” 

our businesses 

sp 

sp is the world’s foremost provider of credit ratings with offices in over 20 countries around the world sp is an important part of the world’s financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions and access to the financial markets the key constituents sp serves are investors corporations governments and municipalities commercial and investment banks insurance companies asset managers and other debt issuers 

sp differentiates its revenue between transaction and nontransaction where transaction revenue includes new issuance of corporate public finance and structured finance debt instruments bank loans and corporate credit estimates and nontransaction revenue includes annual fees for customer relationshipbased pricing programs surveillance fees and ratings fees earned relating to cancelled transactions “breakage fees” 

global markets have begun to recover and some are expanding rapidly particularly those in emerging economies such as china and india and raising capital is key for growth though some uncertainties do remain individuals countries and corporations will continue to require access to world capital markets and investors will demand the diversification they offer the primary risk point in the financial markets has moved to europe there was record investmentgrade bond issuance in 2010 and we have seen the reemergence of the speculativegrade market new financial legislation around the world will help improve investor confidence and market stability 

mh financial 

mh financial is a leading global provider of digital and traditional research and analytical tools for investment advisors wealth managers and institutional investors it deploys the latest innovative technology strategies to deliver to customers an integrated portfolio of crossasset analytics desktop services valuation and index benchmarks and investment recommendations in the rapidly growing financial information data and analytics market the key constituents mh financial serves are asset managers investment banks investors brokers financial advisors investment sponsors and companies’ backoffice functions including compliance operations risk clearance and settlement 

mh financial differentiates its revenue between subscription and nonsubscription where subscription revenue includes credit ratingsrelated information products the capital iq platform investment research products and other data subscriptions and nonsubscription revenue includes fees based on assets underlying exchangetraded funds as well as certain advisory pricing and analytical services 

the increasing interconnections among the world economies and financial markets underpin the need for financial information the retirement of the baby boomers in developed countries as well as the emergence of a vast new middle class in developing countries will also increase the need for financial services 

mhe 

mhe is one of the premier global educational publishers and consists of two operating groups the school education group “seg” serving the elementary and high school “elhi” markets and the higher education professional and international group “hpi” serving the college and university professional international and adult education markets as world economies become increasingly centered on the service sector and technology and global population continues to rise education is more than ever the key to growth 

the elhi market is changing with digital capabilities becoming increasingly critical seg sells textbooks print and digital versions digital and hybrid supplemental materials and provides online and traditional assessment and reporting services the key markets are prekindergarten elementary secondary testing supplemental vocational and postsecondary fields in the united states the market for textbooks consists of adoption states which are states that provide educational funding to school districts for specific programs based on adoption calendars and open territory states which are states that do not follow adoption calendars this market is influenced strongly by the size and timing of state adoption opportunities and the availability of funds in adoption states and in the open territory federal support has eased some of the pressure on state and local finances which has helped to mitigate the cutbacks in k12 education 

in the college and university market and the international market we sell integrated digital elearning platforms textbooks and other resources to higher education institutions key markets are international college university postgraduate fieldsmarkets and english as a second language esl for higher education worldwide medicine healthcare engineering science computer technology business and general reference publishing for professional and education business and professional for international 

the college and university market is affected by enrollments higher education funding and the number of courses available to students enrollments in degreegranting higher education institutions are projected to rise 13 to 206 million by 2018 according to the national center for educational statistics online enrollments have continued to grow at rates in excess of the total higher education school population internationally postsecondary enrollments are also increasing in many regions notably in india and china and other emerging economies college enrollments are rising more rapidly as the need for bridging skill gaps with collegeeducated workers grows continuing education is becoming more common as workers may need to change careers several times over the course of a working lifetime 

im 

im consists of two operating groups the businesstobusiness group “b2b” including such brands as platts jd power and associates mcgrawhill construction and aviation week  and the broadcasting group which operates nine television stations four abc affiliated stations located in denver kmghtv indianapolis wrtv san diego kgtv and bakersfield california kerotv and five azteca america affiliated stations in denver kzcotv fort collins kzfctv colorado springs kzcstv san diego kzsdtv and bakersfield california kzkctv 

key markets served by b2b include professionals and corporate executives in automotive aerospace and defense construction and energy and global business and financial professionals traders investors marketers advertisers and consumers worldwide 

the segment’s business is driven by the need for information and transparency in a variety of industries and to a lesser extent by advertising revenue im delivers critical information largely though digital channels for the construction aerospace and defense automotive and general business markets the recent recession has adversely affected the construction and automobile industries these sectors are beginning to stabilize but recovery will be slow information is the main currency of the new industrial age global information coverage and the interconnections in global trade and finance demand faster and more accurate information flows

growing globally by leveraging our position in developed markets and by pursuing opportunities in key developing countries
